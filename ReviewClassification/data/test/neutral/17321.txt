I hesitate to review this book because while I've spent hundreds of hours skimming through it at the library, I've never actually sat down and read it cover to cover. And of course, I did see the TV miniseries and loved it! Anyway, here are my impressions:What sinks this book (more than the miniseries) is not the way Pug Henry is everywhere all at once, or even how completely admirable he is as a character. It's the way Herman Wouk gives such a distorted picture of modern America, modern life, and modern democracy.The great irony of this book is that in terms of temperament, aspirations, and values, Wouk has much more in common with a traditional German officer like Von Roon than with anyone under thirty or living in the United States. The one thing that comes across when Wouk writes about America is disdain for the culture, the education, and the religious values of America itself. You'll notice that all the young characters are weak and foolish -- and they only gain wisdom by submitting completely to authority figures of the older generation.Wouk has absolutely no interest in change as a positive outcome of the war. As a Jew he wants Nazism stopped, for obvious reasons, but he resents secular culture and secular values. He resents minority groups in America, such as women, blacks, and teenagers. And he resents the idea that these groups have demands of their own to make. The natural authoritarian streak in his nature is at odds with his writing an anti-fascist epic. Only silly women desire equality or a role outside the home. Only Communists question the value of religion or point out the role Christianity itself has played in the persecution of the Jews. And no-one is allowed to compare the Negro problem in WWII America with the Jewish problem in Nazi Germany!Frankly, all through the book I was rooting for Rhoda, Janice, and Madeline. Not so much for Natalie, because she's a total suck-up to her old man. Wouk tolerates her feisty mouth at the beginning, but only so she can be "redeemed" by becoming a mother.Old Testament Patriarch wannabe, failing to grasp so much of the change happening all around him in a world at war. The submarine scenes are really good, though.
