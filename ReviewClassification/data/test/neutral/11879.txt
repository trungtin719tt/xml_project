3.5 Good To Be Different StarsI first read the Morganville Vampires series about four years ago, at the beginning of my experience with Paranormal and Urban-Fantasy. At the time I though Twilight and The House of Night were THE SHIT so this wasn't my favorite because it's much darker. But now, 4 years later, I still like this when I can't even stand to read the first book of the other two series.The Morganville Vampires series has its problems. The writing needs a little effort to like and Claire is annoying as hell at the beginning and the 4 main characters are all a kind of immature, hormonal, wrecking ball.At the first 30% of the book you can clearly see that intelligence isn't always accompanied by mature and smart decisions. Claire is supposed to be this uber-intelligent kid who got accepted in colleges like MIT and Yale at 16 but since her parents wouldn't allow her so far from home she ended up in a "Party-College" in Texas. All that is good but then Claire starts making all the bad decisions her parents worried about. When she gets bullied and pushed down a flied of stairs(which could have left her with a broken neck) instead of calling her parents, or going to the police(not that it would have done her much good in Morganville but she didn't know that yet), she tries to find somewhere off campus to live. When she goes to the Glass House to interview for the room she meets a bunch of crazy kids and instead of running as fast as she can and calling her parents, she spends the night.And then despite the fact that a crazy girl actually tried to kill her she goes to school and isn't even particularly careful. TSTL doesn't begin to describe it. But things get better after a point...What makes this book special:In a time when vampires are the best thing after Brad Pitt and David Beckam, Rachel Caine avoids the cliche and tried methods and she doesn't romanticize her vampires. Vampires in Morganville are the bad guys, the monsters lurking in the dark. And you know what? That's freaking GREAT! Vampires see humans as food and the cattle isn't supposed to fall in love with the wolf. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Vampire Love Story as much as the next girl but it's nice to have something different once in a while.We have a group of four friends that haven't all slept, kissed, made out with one another and they don't want to. Who everyone is attracted to becomes clear fast and for once not every guy in the neighborhoof is in love with the heroine. Eve, the actually cool friend, has her guy. Yes, the friend isn't some irrelevant character that isn't as awesome as the heroine. She is just as important and just as awesome.There is no slut-shaming. We have the mean-girls, AKA Monica and her friends, and there is much hate going on between them but it has nothing to do with how many guys Monica has been with or how short her skirt is or if she wears too much make-up at school. Claire hates Monica because Monica is a psychopathic bitch who actually tries to kill her, not steal her boyfriend or mock her clothing.So all in all this book is really good. I though of upping the rating to 4 but I know some of the next books deserve it more so I won't.
