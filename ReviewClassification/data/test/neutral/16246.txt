Gods I'm glad I made it through! 450 pages of slow, boring, irrelevant buildup and 50 pages of Gaia showdown. Actually probably less. After 5 books of suspense and worry about the demigod heroes defeating Gaia, they finally meet her and she's.... Lame. Really lame. Down on one hit. That was a disappointment.NOT a disappointment: Reyna and Nico! They were a breath of fresh air after a whole series of nothing but the prophecied seven.The series has left me with less-than-lovely impressions of the seven:Piper and Jason: poster-boy and -girl for the perfect All-American wonder relationship. Someone get me a bucket.Hazel and Frank: I'm sorry, who? How are these two useful again? Where they even present in the last book?Percy and Annabeth: Marginally cute but I still think Annabeth could do better.Leo: He was funny at first but eventually turned into the Deus ex Machina mechanic, nothing more.Reyna and Nico, on the other hand, were the real heroes of the book.Nico: Flawed in the best way. He's like one of those candies that are hard on the outside but gooey and sweet on the inside &lt;3 my favorite!Reyna: A queen and a true leader - she lends her strength to lesser peers. Octavian tries to take over her position and Reyna's like, "Whatever bitch, you don't even register as competition" and LEAVES. SO awesome.
