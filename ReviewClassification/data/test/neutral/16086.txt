Beastly started slow, but as the story progressed, picked up speed and ended with a satisfying conclusion. The character of Kyle Kingsbury (aka the Beast) developed gradually and realistically.I didn't know if I'd enjoy this YA book at first, (due to the noted slow start), but by 1/4 of the way in, I was invested and looked forward to seeing how author Flinn would bring the classic fairy tale to it's end within the modern setting.There is some profanity, and some suggestive dialog, but nothing happens. I would say that overall this is a good book for teens to read. Both sexes should be able to take something from the message of looking beyond the surface and accepting people for who they are. Altogether, a satisyfing YA read.
