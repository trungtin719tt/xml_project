This series was basically my childhood. I was super disappointed that this story would not be told by any of my favorite characters (Percy or Annabeth). I'm not sure why I didn't like this a lot. Maybe because I read this over the course of so many days? Maybe because of finals week and other distractions?My rating system: (Idouse half stars.)5-I do not use the 5 star. Not because a book might not be worthy, but because a book is never perfect.4- Ilovedit! There weren't too many flaws, and I had no trouble getting through it. (A 4 star rating is the highest rating I've ever given a book.)3- Ienjoyedthe book, but there we're flaws that made me enjoy it less.2- Ifinishedthe book, but there were too many flaws for me to enjoy it.1- Icould not finishthe book, and I probably did not finish it....
