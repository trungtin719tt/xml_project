3.5 starsIf not for being my book club choice for March I probably would not have read A Walk In The Woods by Bill Bryson, and though I didn't vote for it I'm happy to have read it. Bill Bryson, a much published travel writer, was mid 40's when he struck upon the idea of walking the Appalachian Trail (AT). At time of publishing, the AT was around 2200 miles of wilderness and was the longest continuous footpath in the world. Bryson and buddy Stephen Katz embarked on this walk with little preparation, almost no experience, way too much gear, and a powerful fear of bears and other assorted wildlife. (Their unpreparedness for a walk of this magnitude reminded me a little of Wild by Cheryl Strayed - although Bryson's book was published 15 years before hers). Bryson spins an entertaining tale of their highs and lows, the people they met, the cold, the heat, the best and worst of their experiences, in a humorous manner interspersed with factual information about the history of the AT, the geology, biology, flora and fauna. Bryson has an acerbic wit and at times he had a Michael Moore ring to his words when critiquing National Park &amp; Forest Services administrators. This wit was sometimes directed towards Katz making me squirm and wonder if Katz wasn't getting a bad rap, but I guess that's male mateship for you. By books end there was no question in my mind that regardless of their differences the friendship was solid and there was mutual trust and respect between the two.If the point of the book was to take readers on a hiking journey it succeeded. If it was to portray the beauty of the wilderness it succeeded. If its success can be measured by the number of times I thought "I want to do this walk!!" then it was a winner, particular if you consider the fact I loathe camping and am not really an outdoorsy kind of person. A Walk In The Woods provided me with some feel good moments, (some cringe worthy ones too) and more than a few laughs. It was a good balance of factual information, opinion and anecdotes told in an engaging and interesting manner.
