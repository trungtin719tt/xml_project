Not much to add to the other reviews. The story goes on very well. No new paranormal creatures, but we do get a murder mystery inside a couple of others that makes for a complicated mess. I wasn't terribly happy with Harris letting Sookie find out information &amp; purposely leaving us in the dark for so long. It seemed like a cheap way to draw out the suspense. The book is told in the first person, after all. I think it would have been a stronger story if we'd known what she did.Parker again did a wonderful job of reading this. On to the next,All Together Dead.
