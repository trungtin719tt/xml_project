I'll admit that Picoult can tell a story and keep me interested, but she has some seriously annoying writing tics that almost made me stop reading. Some examples: "...,' he said softly"; "...,' she said thickly"; and (my favorite) "...,' he said, his eyes shining." Blech. Spare me! If only I had a dollar for every time I had to read one of these trite phrases. Is there not some other way to convey that someone is speaking softly than by saying "softly"?Also, someone needs to re-edit this book because I found errors (like, saying he instead of she).Yes, I realize this isn't the type of substantive review that will help anyone, but I had to rant.(Ben, if you are reading this, I know you are rolling your eyes. Probably Minnie, too.)
