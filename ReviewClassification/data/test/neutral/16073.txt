Official Movie Trailerhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZmOm3......Love is never ugly...***Movie Poster***[image error]Book ReviewI've been curious to read this ever since I've watched the new movie trailer of this book which will stars Alex Pettyfer and Vanessa Hudgens, and that would be showing on March 2011. I love Alex Pettyfer and I really wanted to read the book first so I'll have an idea what will be going on when I'm gonna watch the film.The reason that I gave it 3 stars is because I have actually a very high expectations that this book will gonna be amazing since actually the Beauty and the Beast was among my favorite fairytale and my other favorites includes The Little Mermaid and Rumpelstiltskin. Actually The Little Mermaid has somewhat like a subplot in here, wherein the mermaid, the frog prince and the bear from Snow White and Rose red were chatting to Mr. Anderson.I really liked it but I'm not really amazed by it but I think it's a great retelling and I still looking forward to watching it come to life in the film.
