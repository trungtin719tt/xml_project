Note: I am considering this book the finale of a trilogy, becauseExtraswas an un-planned addition.It is finally time for me to deal with Specials, the final book in the trilogy that began withUglies.I have put off this review for a couple of days, because I honestly dont know how I feel about this one.I think the main problem for me, is the fact that Specials is the conclussion to a trilogy, yet it certainly did not seem that way when I was reading it. Allow me to explain:The Hunger Games Trilogy: In bothThe Hunger GamesandCatching Fire, Collins builds up the intensity, making it clear from the first moment who the good guys and bad guys are. She keeps us in suspence, and ends Catching Fire on such a note we are desperate getMockingjay-eager to find out weather Katniss or The Capitol prevails, to find out how everything concludes. If she chooses Gale or Peeta? The point is, the first two books set up for an epic finale.Chaos Walking Trilogy: Much the same,The Knife of Never Letting GoandThe Ask and the Answerbuild up our excitement, desperate to see which side wins. Again, we know thatMonsters of Menwill finish everything in a breathtaking manner.This comes to my problem withSpecials. It does not seem like a grand finale to the trilogy, but more like any ordinary book. There was a beginning, a middle and an end. The major plot twist came half way through, as oppose to the previously mentioned finale's, when the beginning is book one, middle is book two and the end is book three. We know what to expect from #3, and know that so much is at stake.Maybe this is the fault ofUgliesandPretties. Whilst very, very good, those two books did not build up our excitement enough, and the vibe of an exciting,fast conclusion is missing, and is instead replaced by a normal plot.That is how I saw it anyway.I hope that makes sense. It does, at least in my mind.Anyway, it was an enjoyable book, just not what I expected.I found the major action scene in the armory a little hard to follow, and there were many paragraphs through out the book that I had to re-read, just to make sense of.However, the last half of this book was excellent. It certainly had the trilogy-epic-finale feel about it.The action was great, as was the descriptions and emotion. Especially, involving the death scene of a certain-character. In my opinion, the finale of all trilogies/seriesmusthave the death of an important character. Westerfield wrote that particular scene very well, and it felt very real-the characters reactions were amazingly believable.Also, the final showdown with Dr. Cable was great. Very visual and well written. The action in this scene was fast-yet very clear.Infact, the second half of this novel was wonderful. Brilliantly paced and highly addictive. I stayed up until 3AM to finish it.Oh, and I really,reallyliked Shay in this book for some reason.Its not as good asUglies, though its better thenPretties.Final mark: 3.5 stars
