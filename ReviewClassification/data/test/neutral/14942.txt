This is a book I've read a couple times in the past and realized I never actually wrote a review for it. From what I remember, this one focused on the shifters more and less on the vampires, so right there, that gets a lower rating from me. :PWhen I read these books, esp. if I'm re-reading, I just skim for the Eric Northman parts. There is always what I think of as lots of filler and I rarely get into the side plots. I don't remember too many specifics from this honestly, so this will be a basic review.
