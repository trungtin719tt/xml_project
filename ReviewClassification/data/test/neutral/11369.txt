I feel a little unfair giving this book only 3 stars, but that is what I feel it deserves if it is to be judged on its own. There's a lot of good stuff in here, but then there's a whole lot of draggy description and slow movement, and that somewhat overwhelms the book for me.But hey, Arwen actually had a speaking role in this book, so maybe I should give the star back, eh? Nah. Just kidding. There were three different romance lines in this book, PLUS a love triangle... of sorts. It's lucky I don't drop it down to two stars! :PIn all honesty though, I don't really know what to say about this book. I like that there are some bits of excitement and battle, some tension, but in the end everything was resolved and wrapped up all neatly, and everyone got their happy ending and suchlike, but man, after that ring goes into the fire, it just takes SOOOO LOOOONNGG to actually end the book. That's always going to ruin the readthrough for me somewhat. *sigh*But, overall, this is a good ending to a great series that is a bit slow moving at times, but has great heart and an epic quest. You can't go wrong reading Tolkien... though the movies are far less investment. ;)
