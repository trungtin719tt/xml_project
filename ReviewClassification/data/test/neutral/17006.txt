I have quite mixed feelings about this book. While I found the sections on the war proper quite devastating and very well done, I also found the framing device of the pre-war romance and more present day life far less effective and also less well written. My feelings may also be affected to some extent by other World War I literature that I have been reading as part of the Centennial over the past few months.I found that the frame story, actually a dual frame, diminished the war story tremendously. In fact I wondered, prior to the war story beginning, whether I would want to complete reading the book.I've read so many excellent books with the WWI group that did not bother with that kind of tacked on romance, etc. It's simply not necessary. And Faulk certainly demonstrated the skill to write a full book without it. This made me wonder whether he may not have trusted his audience to come to the book. But then I see how many others give this book top ratings and realize that I am out of sync with the majority on this book. But I have no problem with that. I was simply quite surprised when I read the it as my expectations were much different!!
