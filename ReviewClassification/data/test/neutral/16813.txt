This book, the third in Ben Peller's "To Live" trilogy, features Shawn Michals/Rusty Loury/Ben Peller in a wild attempt to not only find himself but rescue an island in the process. It's intriguing, confusing at times, and also pretty inspiring. Given what's going on in the world these days, it's overall pretty inspiring. Ben Peller may be, quite frankly, out of his mind, but he's an entertaining writer.
