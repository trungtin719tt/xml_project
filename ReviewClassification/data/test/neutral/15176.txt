For those who can't stand it any longer, Sookie and Quinn finally have some quality time in the beginning. Then her life goes back into the usual chaos she seems to thrive on, in this case a vampire summit during which A LOT of bad things happen and Sookie manages to entangle herself with her former beaus again. I liked this one because there are so many new characters and yet you get a strong impression of each one. Some old characters reveal a little more about themselves, in some cases too much (especially for Sookie) and there is retribution all around. There are some hilarious comments of South vs. North which maybe only a Westerner can laugh at in disbelief. Will Sookie finally step out and get some much needed downtime from vampdom? Could the series survive if she did? Will Sookie ever manage to keep a beautiful dress she really likes?!
