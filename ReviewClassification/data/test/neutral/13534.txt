I am a great lover of fantasy but I am discovering that I prefer my fantasy books to be original and not based on fairy tales. (One notable exception beingCinderand its sequels). Fairy tales are known for their cruelty and hardship andDaughter of the Forestis quite relentless in this respect. It may be that the book was just a bit too long and Sorcha's tedious task seemed to take forever. However I was uncomfortable with several of the scenes and wished they had not occurred. I won't be continuing with this series but I will look to see what elseJuliet Marillierhas written since everyone else seems to find her a five star author!
