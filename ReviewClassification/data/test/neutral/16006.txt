3.5 starsEvery day is a book about a person/being called A that switches bodies every day. One day when A is in the body of a boy named Justin, A falls in love with Justin's girlfriend. This book is a hit or miss type of book and while I understand a lot of the criticisms it gets I quite enjoyed it.The concept of Everyday to me is extremely interesting. The idea of a genderless being moving from body to body daily is captivating and although some of the rules surrounding this concept are a little underdeveloped I still enjoyed it. I found the lack of concreteness surrounding the logistics of A's existence to add to the story. To those who often read highly detailed and sensical fantasy, sci-fi and dystopian novels I would not be surprised if you do not enjoy this novel. I quite enjoyed the vagueness to it which I know is problem among a lot of people. The lack of guidelines and rules though left me thinking about what they could be for days and I liked creating my own versions of them.I also loved the writing in this book. David Levithan never disappoints me. Everytime I read a book of his I am writing notes and leaving sticky notes on every page, marking my favourite passages and exposition. I am a sucker for beautiful writing, like most of us are, and this book was full of it. Paired with the beautiful writing was the wonderful aspect of the daily change in A's perception of the world. Each day in a new body A sees the word and them self a little bit differently. Levithan writes this change of pov so well, it was my favourite part of the whole book. I have recommended this book solely for this element.So the romance of this book. It is 100% insta romance. So that's a problem. Also in the first few chapters, A literally stalks Rhiannon(whilst in other people's bodies) so that's also a problem. That being said however the romance of this book didn't bother me.That's not to say I liked it, I didn't, I didn't at all. I just liked all the other elements so much that I could look past it. I found myself reading this book so quickly for that reason alone, I zoomed past all the romance centred parts to get to the actual good stuff. Then again this is a lot easier said than done. I never read a book for the romance so I have a lot of practise ignoring romance arcs(especially in YA) whether it's an insta love stalker story or not. If however you are going into this book expecting an original love story about gender/looks/body type/skin colour being unimportant, you're fresh out of luck. The love story is classic one-sided love at first sight. Nice "guy" "fixes" sad invisible girl(I say nice guy because although A made it perfectly clear they didn't identify as either binary gender Rhiannon was insistent on referring to A as a boy.) Rhiannon also visibly changes the way she treats A when their not in the body of a skinny good looking boy so the notion of outward appearance not mattering is lost.All in all, Everyday is a good book with a lot of interesting well-written elements. I would leave out the romance if I could but I would definitely recommend this book. I wouldn't go as far as calling it a favourite but it was a good reading experience.
