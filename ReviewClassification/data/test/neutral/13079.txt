All I see is people bitching about this book. I have a simple solution: DON'T READ IT IF YOU'RE THAT UPSET OVER THERE BEING A FOURTH BOOK.I would have been pissed if she ended Silence the way she did without there being this book to tie things up. I don't know how people would have been satisfied with that ending.But it seems a lot of people hate the series and keep reading. That makes no sense to begin with...---Just finished the book and lol. I made a ''WTF'' face a lot, especially towards the end. But I'm glad the series didn't end with Silence. So my rant above still stands. :)
