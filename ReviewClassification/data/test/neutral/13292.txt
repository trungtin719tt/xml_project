Check out this audiobook!I received a hard-disc copy of this audiobook for free in exchange for my honest opinion. Full review to come.3 of 5 stars (Please read my rating system further below.I think listening to this book as an audiobook really enhanced my experience while indulging in the story. Because of that, I would really like to thank Brilliance Audio for sending me a copy of the audiobook, it made me enjoy the book so much more than I would've if I had physically the book. My favorite part about this book would have to be the characters. Colin is such a smart ass who had so much more to experience in life while Hassan was just a guy who wanted to shit for the hell of it. The drastic difference between their personalities really made their quest so much more fun. I loved Colin's obsession with the fact that he needed a "Eureka" moment, it was fantastic and one of the things that I'd expect a child prodigy not to be expected because his life is literally supposed to be filled with "Eureka" moments (come on, he's a genius!!). Overall, I really liked the "finding yourself" moral/theme that the book took (I think by now that it's time that I realize that the "finding yourself" story is John Green's specialty). It's not my favorite John Green book, but it was worth the listen/read!My rating system: (Idouse half stars.)5-I do not use the 5 star. Not because a book might not be worthy, but because a book is never perfect.4- Ilovedit! There weren't too many flaws, and I had no trouble getting through it. (A 4 star rating is the highest rating I've ever given a book.)3- Ienjoyedthe book, but there we're flaws that made me enjoy it less.2- Ifinishedthe book, but there were too many flaws for me to enjoy it.1- Icould not finishthe book, and I probably did not finish it....
