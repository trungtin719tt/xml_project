Sixteen-year-old Bianca Olivier is the only daughter of two teachers who have decided that to help Bianca overcome her shyness and become more involved in the world, they are sending her to Evernight Academy, an isolated boarding school. She's not going alone though: both her parents get teaching jobs at the school, but Bianca hates it as soon as she sees it. With its huge towers, gargoyles and Gothic architecture, the old school intimidates her as much as the principal, Mrs Bethany, does.On the morning of the first day of school, orientation, Bianca decides to pretend to run away in order to convince her parents she doesn't belong. She makes it only as far as the forest when she thinks a strange man is chasing her. He turns out to be one of the students, Lucas Ross, attractive and just a little bit wild. Bianca feels instantly drawn to him and they seem to hit it off, but when school starts in earnest he completely ignores her.The other students are even less welcoming. Rich and snobby, they alienate the newcomers like scholarship girl Raquel, or Vic with his Hawaiian shirts - and Bianca, who is mostly ignored rather than tormented because of her parents. When Lucas does start talking to her again, relieved she hasn't become one of "them", his comments and protective gestures show he's worried or suspicious about the school.As their friendship deepens into something more, the school's big dark secret threatens to come between them and change Bianca's life forever.This engaging novel has a big twist about halfway through which I will do my best not to even hint at - it came as a lovely surprise to me, as it will to you too I hope. It was quite clever really, and just goes to show what we've come to expect from YA paranormal romance these days. (It's no secret that it's about vampires - that's revealed in the prologue.)Described as "star crossed lovers", Bianca and Lucas are certainly that. Bianca, who narrates, makes a strong point at the beginning to explain how shy she is - verging on a disability, she leads you to believe. She's really not. She didn't strike me as a shy person once during the entire novel. That was a flimsy pretext and her parents' reasoning for sending her to Evernight could have been stronger, but it works well enough.I actually love books, YA in particular, that spend a lot of time in school. The Harry Potter novels, for example - especiallyThe Order of the Phoenix. Doesn't bore me in the slightest. They make the world feel completely tangible, so that I can practically taste it. Detailed. Real. Compelling.For a book set in a boarding school, you'd expect more of that wouldn't you? Instead it skims quickly over those aspects, jumping ahead in time in big bounds so that before you know it, an entire year has gone by. When it did stop long enough to dwell on something slightly academic, or non-romance or non-mystery-related, itwasboring.The scenes with Bianca and Lucas were fiery and compelling, yet also somehow lacking - most likely because there wasn't enough outside their chemistry to support them. Despite Bianca narrating, and despite Lucas's many scenes, you never really get to know them well. For Lucas that makes sense, I suppose, since he's hiding some big secrets. But I wasn't convinced, I didn'tbelievein his attraction to Bianca, not the way it was described. Well, I believed some, but.While for the first half of the novel you're completely caught up in the eery creepiness of Evernight - and Bianca's parents - and what the Big Secret could be, the second half, now that the Big Secret's out, drags a bit. There's a second revelation at the end but by then you pretty much expect it. Evernight, the place, lost its allure for me and I don't know that I care enough to read the second book,Stargazer, which is also set there.
