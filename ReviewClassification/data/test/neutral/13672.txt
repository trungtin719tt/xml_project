Sixteen-year-olds Gwyneth Shepherd and Charlotte Montrose are cousins, born only two days apart and raised in the same house by their close-knit, comically dysfunctional family. They thoroughly resent each other. Charlotte is a multitalented model student, beautiful, graceful, and poised. Gwyneth - Gwen for short - scrapes by in school, trips on her own legs, suffers from a nervous stomach, says the wrong thing everytime, has no fashion sense, and her only talent is memorizing inane pop culture trivia. Also she sees dead people.There are two families in this London with a secret "time travel" gene that manifests in the de Villiers men and the Montrose women. Each time-traveller's birth has been foretold. Charlotte is apparently this generation of Montrose' traveller, called the Ruby, and she has been trained since early childhood. But there's been a mistake. The Ruby is not Charlotte, but awkward, silly Gwen, who has no idea what to do. And now a threat from the past is about to enter the present, because of course it is.Content AdvisoryViolence: Gideon de Villiers and Gwen are attacked by assassins in the eighteenth century. She saves him by picking up a sword and stabbing the last remaining assailant. There's a lot of blood, and she's aghast at how easily the blade pierced flesh ( "like cutting a cake!" ) Gideon reassures her that she missed the vitals and the man will live, but she's still deeply shaken. Their coachman got half his face shot off during the skirmish. The whole scene had a realistic, somber tone very different from the rest of the book.Sex: A few fleeting innuendos. Gwen is embarrassed by the cleavage on her eighteenth-century gown and is given a bodice insert to cover it. On another occasion, she indignantly accuses Gideon of staring at her chest. She bumps into a young couple who look just like her and Gideon kissing behind a curtain at a party in the 1700s, and they themselves kiss at the end of the book - in the empty confessional of an abandoned church, which is not the best place for that, but then theywerehiding from assassins...Language: A few used of "bloody" so we know we're in England.Substance Abuse: Racokzy is experimenting with belladonna.Nightmare Fuel: Racokzy's drug use has made his eyes opaque like a corpse's. St. Germaine is a Sith Lord in all but name. The Circle claims that their time machine needs blood samples from all the travellers in order to run.ConclusionThisRubyis not quite perfectly cut. There are a few parts where you can tell it was written by an Anglophile rather than a real Briton, and many places where you can tell it was written by an adult rather than a teen (most of Gwen's movie star tidbits go back to the 90s). The conflict is extremely hard to follow. Gwen often reads like a much younger character - she constantly whines and panics, needs everything explained to her over and over again, and must either eat, throw up, or go to "the loo" every two pages of so.But you can still recognize the London setting, the plot is no sillier or more convoluted than the average YA urban fantasy - and Gwen's pathetic awkwardness is actually acknowledged and played for laughs, making her a lot more relatable than many other main characters in this genre. Even the sparks between her and the much cooler Gideon are plausible enough; the book just asks us to believe that they are attracted to each other, not that they're already in love after two days of knowing each other.A well-paced time travel thriller/comedy, quite clean overall and largely free of Insta-love, that doesn't take itself too seriously. Recommended for fans of the Selection series, the Stravaganza series, and the Secrets of Nicholas Flamel books.
