Le sigh.... I wanted to love this book. I really did. But the characters frustrated me to no end. I did however, love Lucas and Jacqueline - the parts of the book where they were actually interacting were by far the highlights of the story for me.The hero and heroine just did not make what I'd call smart relationship decisions. I was really rooting for them and they WERE utterly adorable together, but they just didn't seem to be very functional for a vast majority of the book.I felt like they kept making the wrong calls - not choosing the smart, functional path. I really just wanted yell at them... No, don't ignore her. No, don't play games with him. No, don't go to your ex's house. No, don't lie to her. No, the solution is not that 'we can't be together'. No, don't be passive when you know he's hiding something, call him on it. And just tell each other how you feel!!!!They spent so much of the book ignoring each other! Gah! They'd interact, then go days without speaking, then interact again, go back to ignoring, or deciding things wouldn't work out, then talk again, then ignore more... sigh. It got frustrating. There was a lot of stupidy. A lot of 'hot-cold'. Kinda made me want to bang my head against a wall and then just lock them both in a room together until they communicated more.I basically felt it would have been very easy to have avoided most of the problems and angst of this book by simple communication.This being said, I didn't dislike the book at all, there were definitely good parts to it and it did keep my attention.I really did love Lucas - what a gorgeous tortured character! I was totally swooning over him! As the best friend said,"Holy fuckburgers. Who was that hot guy?"lol. He was so respectful, so protective, and quite the gentleman while still being a total kick ass, tattooed and pierced bad boy college hottie.Jacqueline though... I was kind of on the fence about her. I didn't like how she played games with Lucas in the beginning, or would ignore him for days on end (SO frustrating!). But she wasn't a bad heroine, I just didn't really connect with her or agree with her decisions always.And I absolutely loved Lucas and Jacqueline together - when they weren't ignoring each other, they were a seriously CUTE couple!! They had great dialogue, swoony interactions and some very steamy moments!And let me tell you, Ms Weber can write one helluva hot kiss! Seriously!"I pressed against him and he groaned into my mouth and wrenched his mouth from mine, breathing raggedly. "I have to go now, or I'm not going."Honestly though, if it wasn't for how much I liked the parts where Lucas and Jacqueline were actually together, I might have put the book down. I felt I was reading only to get to those parts.Here's how I see Lucas and Jacqueline:
