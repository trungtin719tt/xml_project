This was rather disappointing...To fans of the series, I should mention that the book is still extremely quotable, there is still a lot of irony at the expense of the political/social system. But all in all, I found everything rather confusing.Basically the story could be resumed like this:Arthur Dent gets insultedArthur Dent and Ford Prefect travel through time, and are asked to save the universe.Arthur wants to understand who/what/why is threatening it, while Ford just wants to go to a party. Also, really complex Maths is done in a Bistro.My favorite parts:1.My doctor says that I have a malformed public-duty gland and a natural deficiency in moral fibre and that I am therefore excused from saving universes.2.The alien, who had immortality thrust upon him, and decided to pass the time by insulting every living being in the universe. I actually found it quite clever, how the story had both started and ended, with him coming to insult Arthur.=====================================review of the 2nd book:The Restaurant at the End of the Universe
