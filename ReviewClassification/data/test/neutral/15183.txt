man oh man there is nothing better than a good sarah dessen binge read in the summer.this book is Especially good, because it's pret-ty different from the typical dessen. it's a kinda bad girl protagonist!!! who knew that was even possible?? didn't we all think that the female main characters that populate sarah dessen books just came in barely-varying flavors of Vanilla.remy is a bit o' a badass - she dates around, she smokes sometimes, she drinks underage (gasp!). basically she's a much more normal and interesting specimen. a pleasant surprise.the group of friends in this is pretty fun too. the ever-present family drama is dramatic as ever. the unfortunately the equally-unavoidable romance is the most boring, uninteresting plotline in the history of the universe, but you win some you lose some you know?bottom line: WHY DIDN'T I DO THIS SARAH DESSEN REREAD YEARS AGO. my god, what a blast.
