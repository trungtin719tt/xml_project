I received a copy of this to review from a LibraryThing give away and I was really excited by the opportunity to read it. Overall I enjoyed the read but I think there were some things that could have been done better. Much of the things I didn't like about it may have been due to the fact that I don't really read that much YA...so I think my comments should be taken with some grains of salt.The voice of the main character grabs the reader initially and you are cheering for him throughout the book. I did think he was a bit juvenile for 14 at times but I definitely connected with him.As the story goes on there is a really rich world that Bernard (MC) gets to explore in his Dad's brain. I thought the premise of this was really clever and liked how the hemispheres had different cultures. I would have actually loved for it to go more in depth into this and really amp up the level of detail. Again this may have been a function of keeping the book short/light for a younger audience. For example one of the characters develops a crush on another creature. But the cultural implications of a Holon (their humanoid being) having a thing for a Telamon (which is like a mystical creature) isn't delved into.There were some issues with the pacing of the book as well, which again may be a function of trying to keep it short. Events happened almost TOO fast... sometimes in a way that was a tad confusing...and I wanted more time to kind of get into the whole world of the brain.I thought the whole concept of the Reezon vs. Intuit sides being imbalanced and how their civilizations were different and how that affected Bernard's Dad was really clever and a good way to introduce kids to the concept of the hemispheres of the brain. A kid/teen might have found this to be a good level of detail/good length. As an adult I wanted a little more story and more science. And also more resolution to the various story lines that got put into the book.Lastly there were some inconsistencies that I think an editor would have caught and so I'm not sure how many times this one went through the ringer but it probably should have gone through one more round.Over all I think 12/13 year old me would have liked this a lot more than 29 year old me, so if you are shopping for a person in that age group maybe add a star :)
