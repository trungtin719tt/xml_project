I found this book extremely hard to read but I was determined to finish it no matter what. I felt like most of it just went over the top of my head. It is unlike any book i have ever read. I usually enjoy books that are classed as "shocking" or "disturbing" (American Psycho is one of my favorite books) but I cant say I enjoyed this. I found it laborious and at times incredibly dull. I am fully aware that it is a book a lot of people have found deep meaning in, so I realize that maybe I just didn't understand it. I gave it 3 stars because although a lot of it seemed to pass me by, I found glimpses of brilliance in it at times when I could understand what Burroughs was really talking about in certain parts.To summarize, this book is not for everyone, even for people who revel in enjoying books that are not for everyone.
