This is where it starts to go downhill, in my view. I recall skimming a lot of this because I just wasn't interested in the werewolf politics and war. Plus, the fairy stuff comes in more and that was never my favorite part of the series. If I'm not mistaken, Quinn is just almost written off in this one until Sookie finds out where he's been. I always disliked how their relationship ended. Quinn basically chooses his family over Sookie, but the way it played out seemed like a bit of lazy writing to me. I think Charlaine Harris just wanted to get him out of the way.Plus, this is when Sookie starts to get all angsty about her bond with Eric and that always pissed me off. There's more boring Hot Shot stuff and I also never liked the Felipe de Castro storylines and he is in this one too. Meh.
