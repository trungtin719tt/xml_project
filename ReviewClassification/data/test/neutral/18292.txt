I adored a Wrinkle in time. It's one of my all time favorites, but I feel like the series slowly deteriorated from there. I liked A Wind in the Door, but I didn't love it quite as much. Quite frankly, I fell asleep reading a Swiftly Tilting Planet. I only made it halfway through the last book. I missed the interactions between Meg and Calvin in the last 2 books. They were my favorites. And it was weird to jump from being in school to being married and pregnant. It wasn't as fun to read. My friend didn't even want to read the last 2 books when I told her that Meg was married and pregnant in A Swiftly Tilting Planet. It was too much of a jump for me. If there was a book in between the 2nd and 3rd filling in the gaps, I think I would've been happier. Plus the 3rd book was just plain boring and hard to follow, especially if you're 12. I had to force myself to finish it.
