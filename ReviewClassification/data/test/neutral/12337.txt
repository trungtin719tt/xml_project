Compared to the voluminousAtlas ShruggedandThe Fountainhead, Anthem is a chapter.But Rand may have been better adapted to writing shorter fiction because this one packs a lean, economical and hungry punch. Dystopian but told like a fable, this is a serious work that works on multiple levels. Very good.Of the three works, I liked them in this order:The FountainheadAnthemAtlas Shrugged
