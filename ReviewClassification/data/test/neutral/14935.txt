So, I finally watched some episodes of "True Blood" last night. Wow, did they ever sex it up!! And, although the main storyline is the same as the first book, it was weird to see all of the "creative liberties" that were taken. The Jason storyline? Weird. But, I guess having Jason in the show helped them to put tons more sex in it. I was glad to have the fast forward button, because, ya know, I'm just not interested in looking at this guy's ass so darn much. I haven't even seen my own ass as much as I saw his in just a few episodes. Dude, seriously, pants...To the book! Okay, so this one was not as good as the last one because Eric. He has his memory back, but with his time spent with Sookie missing. It is driving him crazy to know what happened between them, but Sookie won't tell. When she finally, finally, has to give in and tell him, so that he will help her, the exchange is pretty hilarious."Did we have sex?" he asked me directly.For about two minutes, this might actually be fun. "Eric," I said, "we had sex in every position I could imagine, and some I couldn't. We had sex in every room in my house, and we had sex outdoors. You told me it was the best you'd ever had...too bad you can't remember it."Eric looked like I'd hit him in the forehead with a mallet..."Is there anything else I should know?""You offered to give up your position as sheriff and come to live with me. And get a job."huh?But, as I said, Eric is not hugely present in this book. It's a darn shame!Instead we get a story that is more about the werewolves and other were-critters. They are being killed by a sniper and Sookie is also being targeted by a murderer. She has her house burned down and gets shot, but she should be used to this sort of thing by now.Pam (on the phone):"What's up?""I got shot.""Oh, too bad," she said. "Eric, do you know what Sookie is telling me? Someone shot her.""Don't get so emotional, Pam," I said. Someone might think you care."She laughed.I like Pam. I love a cold-hearted, tough female in my books.Sometimes I wish I could rip out someone's throat when they're whining too! Man up!So, the focus in the book is on the Were's, as I said, and I came to the realization that I'm not a fan of the Were's. They are kind of jerks. Really emotional jerks. Besides, why would Sookie want a guy who can bring home fleas and might get hair all over her furniture?oh, no! You are NOT coming in the house like that! Bad boyfriend!I say that she should stick with the vamps!
