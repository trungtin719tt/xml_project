3.5 It was cute starsSo, I'm not sure if I've ever divulged this on Goodreads, but my career goal is to one day become a Young Adult Librarian. Because of this I try to read a wide range of YA so I know what to recommend to teens. Glass Houses is one of the books that I normally wouldn't read, but decided to anyway. You know, for the teens ;-)Glass Houses is about Claire, a teenage genius who finds herself in college at the young age of sixteen. Claire is being bullied in the dorms by some fairly sociopathic girls that made me glad my dorm experience wasn't at all like this book. Bitches were scary, like they pushed Claire down a flight of stairs and that was just thewarning. In fear for her life, Claire looks for another place to live off campus, and finds herself at the Glass House. In the Glass House, a cross between Gone with the Wind's Tara and The Munsters design, Claire makes new roommates and friends with Eve, Shane and Michael. As time goes by, weird stuff begins to happen and the four of them must band together in order to survive.I ended up liking this a lot more than I thought I would. It's a fun read that I would recommend to the younger spectrum of teens. I had issues with a few of the concepts/plot points. One of which being that if Claire was such a genius, why wasn't she smarter with her actions? I feel like there was something missing there...Also(view spoiler)[ I felt Claire and Michael had more of a romantic connection than Claire and Shane, but I guess I'll see where this series goes(hide spoiler)]So while I didn't love the book, it was fun and cute, and I'm probably going to continue the series just to see where things go.Happy reading everyone!
