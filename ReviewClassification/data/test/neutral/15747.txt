After I finished this book my overall impression wasn't very good. But in retrospect I think that was mostly due to the fact that it's written for a ten-year-old audience. There's nothing wrong with the book when viewed as a kid's book. The writing is competent, and the story is exciting and interesting enough to keep a ten-year-old engaged. I imagine there are a lot of adults whoarefans of this book, just like there are plenty of adult Harry Potter fans (thoughIdidn't enjoy this one as much as Harry Potter). But while I readily recommend this book for kids, I can't really rationalize recommending it for adults.
