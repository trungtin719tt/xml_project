This didn't "get" me. Not the author's fault. His characters are real: the widow, hooked on tv, obsessed with getting thin, becomes addicted to diet pills which were her vehicle towards a descent to madness (with a little help from an incompetent and corrupt physician); her only son, a junkie, his girlfriend, his buddy and his own girlfriend--all with their heroin-addled brains; their delusions that they are in control of their lives; the demonic power the drug has on them. These made me wonder if the compelling, often gripping, narrative here was merely a product of research or based on the author's personal experience or a combination of both.I, however, had never been addicted except to love and spicy food and these types of addiction are not those which can make you sell yourself or your girlfriends just to get a fix. I can get by without love and I also like bland, unexciting, and repetitious dishes so I eat at home once in a while.To make this review longer may I add, from the book's blurb, that the New York Times Book Review was supposed to have said that to understand this author's work "is to understand the anguish of America." Anguish, my ass. This is very depressing for one like me who lives in a poor country. The first scene here is the son and his buddy pawning his mother's TV to get money for drugs. I go: hey, they have a TV! The mother is supposed to be "poor" but she gets fat on chocolates, bagels and creams. Uuhm, yummy. The son's girlfriend has travelled abroad for leisure, and has her own pad. Wow. The drug of choice: heroin with weed for dessert. Another wow. Here, our addicts, those having their local anguish, are the homeless who live in the streets, under bridges, flyovers and overpasses. They sniff cheap, industrial glue to get high. They eat nothing. Their travels are only as far as their feet can take them. In Hubert Selby Jr.'s America the addicts' happiness is getting high and having sex all day. Here, happiness is like what I saw early one morning while driving along a busy city street. A dirty, completely naked woman in front of a still-closed office on the ground floor of a commercial building in the act of taking a bath without water, holding one arm up after the other, scrubbing her hairy armpits with her imaginary soap, smiling as if she's in a real shower. She probably was even humming a tune.So it is like this: the book says behold the anguish of America. And I imagine my countrymen addicts looking at these anguishing Americans and saying we want to go to America too and have some of that anguish there!
