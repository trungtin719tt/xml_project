Hmmm. So finally I managed to finish reading my first book by Charles Bukowski, and I really don't know what to say. And yet, I'm gonna use this space to say what I want to.Henry 'Hank' Chinaski (supposedly Bukowski's fictional alter-ego) is an aspiring writer &amp; the protagonist of this novel. His life revolves around three things - women, drink &amp; jobs. And he can't stick to just one either, switching from one to another so fast that it's pointless to keep count.Bukowski's prose is absolutely no-nonsense, blunt &amp; enjoyable to read. Chinaski &amp; his 'longest-time' girlfriend Jan's characters are well drawn out but the others are alright.The best thing about this novel is its ability to make the reader laugh out loud. You're reading &amp; suddenly you come across something incredibly funny that you just can't stop laughing. Two instances that stand out (both in the first half) - when Hank has a fight with his father &amp; when a prostitute tries to force herself upon him. Both scenes are outstandingly written in my opinion.But then, Hank Chinaski's antics at work start to get irritating &amp; repetitive as the story dips a bit in the second half of this book. One can only wonder how he fails to hold down any job for long, spends pretty much all his earnings on drinking &amp; still miraculously survives from getting broke. Unbelievable to say the least &amp; even though one might say it's just fiction, you'll either end up marvelling at his ability or being slightly pissed off. For me, it was the latter.I really wish I liked this book more than I actually did, but I'm going with 3 to 3.5 stars for 'Factotum' by Charles Bukowski. Recommended for those who want a quick read that ensures a good amount of laughs throughout.
