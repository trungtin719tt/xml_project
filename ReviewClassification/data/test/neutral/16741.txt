A Passage to Indiais set in the time the British ruled India. Forster wrote this book after visiting India and having first hand seen the real relationship of the ruling British and the ruled natives. Since he had personal experience, it was easy for him to paint a true and accurate picture of how the British administrators governed the natives. First and foremost, Forster saw it was to be oppressive; he was not happy with the way the natives were treated. He observed a difference in the British who ruled India on behalf of the British Crown and couldn't comprehend how the liberal minded youth who were full of goodwill toward the native brethren became hard conservatives once in India in official capacity. He also observed that when the Indians live in British soil the personal relations between the two races were on friendly grounds; but in Indian soil, the relationship between the two races were strained with distrust and hostility. All his observations and his personal views over them led him in producing one of the best written fictions on East and West.The cultural and religious difference between the two races was, according to Forster, the main impediment for closer relations. The different cultures have different manners and different ways of lives. They cannot be compared with one another to determine which is more superior. They are just different. If one culture tries and acts superior, then hostility is the inevitable result. This was the major mistake the British administrators did. From their point of view the natives were "uncivilized"; and they wanted to make them "civilized". By trying to make them "civilized", the British were imposing their culture and their way of life on the natives. They were of the view that what Indians needed were justice, discipline and peace. There they made the mistake, for the natives greatly resented this. What they really wanted was the British to understand, accept and respect their culture, their religion and their way of life. To be treated as a nonentity in your own country is a painful experience. Every race has their pride and wounded pride can lead to calamities. Failure to understand this was the key to hostility between the ruling and the ruled.On the other hand, Forster doesn't defend the natives either. He exposes their weakness, their flaws and their hypocrisies which made me ponder that after all we should view all these actions from pure human perspective. Irrespective of the difference in race, ethnicity, culture and religion, we are all human and as humans we do have inherent flaws; and if we want to live harmoniously and with peaceful human relations, we have to check our flaws and be kind and tolerant towards others.The story through which Forster says it all is good but not great. The first part of this three part story was so slow that my first impression was that I would not be able to push it through. I love Forster's writing. It is absolutely beautiful. And that is what held the thread for me without breaking. But I admit that it was very trying. In part two, the story picks up the pace and although I still struggled through some of the chapters, the reading experience became much more pleasing.Forster had chosen a good set of characters to set out the story. Although I didn't like many of the characters (except Mr. Fielding who I personally thought resemble the author) they essentially contributed well to his story. I feel that it never crosses Forster's mind that the reader should like his characters. I think he is more concerned that we understand them rather than like them.Before I end the review I would like to share a conversation in the story that really struck me hard. During this conversation, Dr. Aziz tells Mr. Fielding that once they become free of British rule that they can be fully friends. That was the most thought provoking sentence of the entire book. Although he cannot hear me, I just wanted to shout out and tell him "Well done, Forster!"
