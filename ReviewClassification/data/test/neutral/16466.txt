This review is by Pippi, guest reviewer, age 1 and a half; tabby cat.This is a book about cats who live in the wild and they catch mice and eat them and they fight. There are four colonies of cats and one of them is mean and steals the other colonies food.At first I thought this book was hard to read because even though it's written in English they try to translate cat words into English so it's hard to follow at first until you get used to the cat words.At the beginning of the story Rusty is a housecat and humans take care of him but then he decides he wants to be a warrior so he joins a clan of cats. They never say what happens to his humans but I bet they miss him a lot. There are not many humans in this book and the ones that are are bad humans. I live with nice humans so I don't know what this is like.Mama says I should read Watership Down because the human author did a nice job of making a story about animals that sound real, kind of like this book does, but that story is about bunnies and who cares about bunnies anyway?
