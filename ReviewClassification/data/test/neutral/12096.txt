Overall, the book was well written and appropriate for a young adolescent audience. It was certainly not written for someone in my demographic!I enjoyed a number of aspects of this book and also a few disappointements. Specifically,1) The resolution of the primary conflict (who gets to be the princess) felt too much like a plot-device (I can't say more without giving away the ending) that the author threw into the story to avoid a painful conflict between the characters.2)The culture of the mountain village and the kingdom as a whole was not developed enough - there was a lot of good potential here. On the other hand...3) What culture was discussed permeated the story. Things like 'quarry-singing', holding hands, and twirling the miri flowers (to name a few) were present throughout the story, lending the culture a consistancy.4) However, the absolute BEST aspect of this book is the over-all theme on the value of education. It was wonderful to see the education the girls received transforming their lives and the lives of their families. Further, I loved how the principle characters recognized the impact and determined to continue pursuing and sharing it.Despite the two negative comments above, please don't misconstrue my review for a negative one. As I said before, this book wasn't really wriiten for me. Were I an adolescent girl this probably would rate 5 stars. I think my daughters will thoroughly enjoy reading the book when they get older (I know I will recommend it to them) and I highly recommend the book for any adolescent girls you may know.
