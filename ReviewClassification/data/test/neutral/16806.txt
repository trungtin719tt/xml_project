Being a fan of Peller's previous "To Live" novels, I was really looking forward to this one. I enjoyed it, although it seemed to be distanced from the other two. Still, it was well written and I plan to read it again. This seems like the kind of book one has to read more than once in order to really "get it." Nothing wrong with that though. I liked it a lot. Thank you Shawn Michals/RustyLoury/Ben Peller for a great journey.
