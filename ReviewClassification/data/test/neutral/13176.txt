I don't know how I feel about this one. I mean the kids are out there trying to get way from the evil people that are trying to hurt them. And we find out some reasons as to why they are the kind of supernaturals that they are but I was just sort of meh.I will say that I loved to get more time with Chloe and Derek. I really love Derek's character! And we learn more about the families of the kids. There is also more action with the supernatural abilities of some of the adults and kids but I still couldn't get into it all the way.Sometimes I wonder if it's the mood I'm in or if I really did just like the book and not love it to death. One will never know unless of course you read it again.Chloe, Rae and Tori are in cells at The Edison Group after they tried to escape with Derek and Simon in the first book. A bunch of stuff happens and Tori and Chloe get away and meet up with the boys. Then more stuff happens and it's a little cray. I also really love the ghost, Liz, in the book too. I hope we get to find out something good for her in the next book.I did enjoy the book, I'm just mad that I didn't love it to death, but we can love them all that way right?MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List
