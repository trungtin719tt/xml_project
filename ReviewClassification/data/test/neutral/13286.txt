I've had this book sitting on my desk for two months. I'm a huge John Green fan, so you can see why this is problematic.The Albuquerque library system is pretty bad. Out of all the libraries systems I've ever used, this has to be the worst. Not only does it not stock any of Justine Larbalestier's books, but it also doesn't have a decent collection of John Green's books.It took me three months to get a copy of An Abundance of Katherines. It took me two months to finish it. Actually, that's a lie. I haven't finished AAoK. I'll probably never finish AAoK. But for the purpose of this review, I've read the entire novel and wasn't satisfied in the least.Everyone knows that John Green uses a formula. Like Sarah Dessen, most of his protagonists are the same character with different hobbies and quirks. Colin is Miles and Miles is Quentin -- only Colin likes anagramming words instead of memorizing last words. Colin, like Miles, is annoying. He only exists for the story to be funneled through him.John Green's protagonists are a beacon of hope for nerds everywhere in the world. While you may be unable to get a date with that hot, unattainable girl, Colin, Miles, and Quentin have dated enough hot girls to last you a lifetime -- or at least until John Green writes another book.His books are full of double standards. Like Kody Keplinger, author ofThe DUFF, John Green claims to present something alternative. This is a lie. The only thing that separates this from any other YA book is that our main character doesn't go through a make-over. Instead, he is accepted by the flawless pretty heroine for no reason whatsoeverWhy can't Lindsey or Margo or Alaska be anything less than gorgeous? Why can't they have goals outside of being with the protagonist? I likeLooking for Alaska, but I think it's important to analyze these things.As a hero, Colin fails. Not only was I disappointed with the 3rd person narration, but I also felt like Colin lacked a soul. He wasn't a full developed character. He was a collection of quirks. I felt the same way about Miles, but at least his flaws were hidden by a cast of interesting characters.As a supporting character, Hassan failed in every way that Takumi and the Colonel triumphed. Takumi didn't feel like the token Asian. Hassan was without a doubt the token Arab. Hassan wasn't funny. He lacked warmth. He was just there to make bad jokes. His use of random Arabic or German was annoying. Every time he said 'kafir' or 'sitzpinkler' I rolled my eyes. Have we really gone back to the time when Mexican characters dropped random bits of Spanish into their sentences?Also, I didn't appreciate how his weight was used as a plot device. No, I'm not misusing that phrase. Hassan was fat for the same reason that all multi-cultural best friends are geeky, over-weight, and unappealing. It was very obvious that Green was writing for white hipster males.As a love interest, Lindsey just wasn't interesting. She paled in comparison to Alaska. A manic pixie must be manic, intriguing, and flawed. Lindsey wasn't. By the time she was finally introduced, I was hoping that Colin would get back with Katherine the Great. At least he would have stopped whining.The romance between Colin and Lindsey was yawn worthy. Even from the flashbacks, whatever Colin had with Katherine the Great moved me ten times as much. Lindsey had no personality outside of being friendly and cute.While the summary says this is a road trip, that is a lie. The road trip ends very quickly. The rest of the book is spent in Tennessee. Conveniently, much like Alaska, Lindsey has no accent. But she is able to put one on in the blink of an eye.There is no plot in this book. There is no climax. If anything, it felt like a writing exercise. We knew that Colin was going to end up with Lindsey. We knew that Hassan wasn't going to keep his girlfriend. This was too predictable, even for Green.I didn't mind the math, but it was only there to prove that Colin was smart. I didn't believe that he was a prodigy. He seemed like one of those whiny gifted kids that complain about being smart when in reality they're just idiots.I recommend skipping everything but the flashbacks. You don't need to read the rest of the story. Like the title says, this is An Abundance of Katherines, and Katherine is the only good thing about it.
