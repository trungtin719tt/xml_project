When a writer pens down a plot based on the evergreen bestselling book, people are bound to sit up and take notice. This I suppose was Anne Rice's idea behind Memnoch the Devil. I haven't read even one of the Vampire Chronicles and the only other Anne Rice book I read to date was a load of crap named 'Violin'. Memnoch surprised me with its vast scope but starting off with an intriguing plot thread, it soon degenerated to a very flat and predictable ending.Consider this, the devil taking along a vampire on a tour of heaven,hell and earth through the bloody alleyways of history to explain to the vampire why he should take sides with him against god. Interesting isn't it ?? So it was, till about midway through the book and then it was like a trapdoor opened somewhere and the entire stage and actors vanished and were replaced by puppets. There are dialogs galore about the nature good and evil, god and devil, salvation and damnation and all things spiritual from a Christian concept. Needless to say I was gripped with this style of story telling as I am not familiar with the concept of Christianity as a whole ( I am yet to read the bible). Even to someone as uninitiated as me, the plot seemed to meander after sometime and the conclusion was an obvious one.The concept of the devil has always posed a lot of questions for me, the fact that such an antithesis exists to the concept of god has baffled and interested me. I hoped to find some answers, but now I have more questions...
