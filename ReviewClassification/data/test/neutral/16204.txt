Sometimes, when I'm looking for a break from the gratuitous aspects of adult life and literature, I like to give YA books a try. This one definitely worked as a little escape.While there are definitely strife, violence, and tension in the story, I still want to call this a nice book--not in a negative or dismissive sense. Overall, its message is positive; but it isn't cloying. I expected an imitation ofThe Lord of the Rings, but it isn't that. While a few things about Halt reminded me of Aragorn, he isn't a shorter, older-looking, commoner version of Aragorn (at least in book 1).I'd definitely recommend it to families with children, unless the children are of the highly sensitive sort who might be disturbed by the descriptions of the fierce monsters.The Ranger's apprentice himself, Will, is 15 years old, but I'm not sure that the book would appeal to a lot of contemporary 15-year-olds. Late bloomers do certainly exist; but in the alternate medieval Europe setting of the book, in which men are considered pretty old at 42, and given that in real life, medieval 15-year-olds were starting families, Will often seems more like a 12-year-old. The book often seems as if it's written with the 9-to-12-year-old bracket in mind. If I'd read this when I was 10 or 11, I probably would've considered it a 5-star book.Reading as an adult, I still found plenty to like. Other than seeming too young, Will--the main protagonist--is a good and likeable kid. I liked Halt the Ranger very much, with his dry sense of humour and impressive skill set. Halt's strategy when dealing with the Battleschool bullies is one of the best I've ever seen. I loved it. (Parents with a zero-tolerance policy regarding violence will not approve; but those parents will no doubt keep this book out of their children's hands just based on its synopsis.) I appreciated the attention to detail regarding ranger and martial skills, especially archery. The action sequences were zingy, with a couple of "woo-hoo!" moments. I liked Horace's story arc and the changes that happened within him.As with quite a few other kids' and YA books, this one has a shifting point of view that bugged me a bit, but that's a pet peeve of mine.I'm not sure I want to read 10 or more books of this series, but I think I'll try the second book at some point and see how it goes.
