Review Below :)Ooooo, the cover is out. It's... different.Ok, this is definitely sounding like a prequel type book guys.It might be the third in the series, but it goes backwards and covers 5000+ years....But perhaps it covers those years as she travels, so it is them looking back, rather than a true prequel? So a hybrid prequel?!REVIEW TIME!Finished Passion in about 4 hours, so a nice quick read.Three and a half stars!Not to sure how to really review this book, as it was so very different to the previous two, and as such had different accomplishments and faults.The overall story fills in the missing aspects from the first two books and helps to fill in the back-story from both Fallen and Torment, which is something that needed to be done. The origin of the curse is also fleshed out and explained so that the readers now have an understanding of why and how it started. It was also important to figure out how and why all the past incarnations of Luce spontaneously combusted. But it needs to be pointed out that this book can be so complex and confusing.The good points were that Luce finally got to see what happened in her past, and how it affected both Daniel and herself. She also needed to grow up a little bit, and I think travelling with Bill made her do so, even if he was a little obvious. But taking Luce away from her friends probably gave her the time to contemplate things without their sometimes overbearing interference, and that shows.Seeing her past selves also allowed her to live parts of their lives, but she kinda stole bits also :) Also seeing the different personalities was an eye opener, kinda assumed she would be the same in all previous lives. Apparently not. Plus, it would seem that we did not get to see their original meeting? But then there was something different about the Chinese Daniel, or was he just more unguarded than the later versions?However, this book also has its flaws. The main one that bugged me through out the whole story was that Daniel 'forgot' all of his past encounters with himself. It was so convenient and really just annoyed me, as it seemed important in this book that he talk to his past self. Also the lack of the other characters, definitely detracted from the story as they give the readers a break from Luce and Daniel. But they were all there at the end, but why did Cam hug Luce and Daniel? Bit strange, and would have loved more of a back story on Cam but the little bit that was there was good!Bill. Way too obvious and way too annoying.The final chapter definitely sets things clearly in motion for the book, Rapture.Any-who, good book, good story and very much looking forward to the last instalment!
