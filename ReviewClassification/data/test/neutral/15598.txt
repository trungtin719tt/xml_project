Hmmm. The romance made more sense to me in this one and I really liked a new element to the story that this book focused on, but I thought the middle dragged. An unnecessary new character was introduced to make a love triangle and I was bored with that whole situation. Daemon is still awful but dang if JLA doesn't write chemistry well.Audiobook review:Same narrator as the first book. Aside from pronouncing Daemon's name wrong, she's a good narrator. Would recommend.tw: violence, near drowning, genetic experiments without the subject's knowledge, kidnapping/disappearances.
