Upon reread 3.5I haven't really changed my opinions from my first review. I really enjoyed this story a lot - though it's not my favorite Jane Austen, but I will forever love her writing!-------------------I really enjoyed this story for the sake of the ridiculous characters, interesting culture, and phenomenal main character.Anne was so strong and stubborn and bold, yet respectful and wise. Truly a character to look up to. In the midst of a culture that gives her very little of the freedoms that woman have today, and a family that would like to give her even less, Anne stood strong by what she wanted, while still honoring her family and the culture of her time. Truly one of the best protagonists I've ever read, as well as an extremely sweet love story in the end.The more distance I get from this story, the more I realize how much I loved it. This is my second read of Persuasion and I'll for sure be reading it again.
