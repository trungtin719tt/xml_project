Boy, did this book surprise me. A surprise recommendation from my son who normally eschews non-fiction history, I eagerly started reading this, thinking I was going to learn some new insights into Gavrilo Princip and the origins of World War I. I actually didn't think I would learn much at all as I had recently read Hasting's "Road to Catastrophe" which covered the topic in quite some depth.The book is not at all a straight non-fiction history and this became apparent in the first few chapters when much time was spent by the author traipsing about the Bosnian hill country where Princip was born. I almost put it aside as I didn't really want a travelogue.But, the more I read, the more I was drawn in. Butcher was a war correspondent during the Bosnian War in the 1990's and as he physically retraced in 2012 Princip's journey from home village to Sarajevo to Belgrade and back to Sarajevo, the journey and people he met (and re-met) were used to tell stories about the recent past in Bosnia as well as stories from the Tito partisan era during World War II. Eventually, the story ends with the movements of the plotters in Sarajevo leading up to Ferdinand's assassination and the immediate aftermath of the captured participants.Since the Bosnian War is close to our own time, was replete with ethnic cleansing, and fought by people not so different from the typical westerner - you can't help but think how lucky we are in the US to not use religion as a tribal reason for fighting zero-sum games over land. Yet, at the same time, extremist elements within our own US(or European) society sharpen (in the back of your mind) Butcher's story about Bosnia over these last 100 years and how easily bad policies can lead to political assassination and unwitting steps to greater tragedy.The conceit of re-tracing Princip's actual journey made for a reasonably original story that invokes retrospective thoughts on the fragility of modern society told through the unhappy history of Bosnia. WW I may seem far away but Bosnia of the 90's is not.
