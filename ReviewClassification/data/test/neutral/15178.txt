Every time I take a break in between one Sookie book and the next I have to reacclimate myself to the heinosity. This series really is quite stupid. But I can't help myself, I love it.Sookie's thought process at the beginning of the book over the merits of warm penis vs. cold penis was way too gross for me to handle. For real. But otherwise this one was alright...especially once the fireworks started at the end.
