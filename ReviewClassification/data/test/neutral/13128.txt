Y'know when you're watching a film and there's a shot or even a sequence that's just really cleverly done? Like all the long shots inRomaor the locust swarms inDays of Heavenor essentially all ofFitzcarraldo? These scenes rip you from the suspended disbelief of narrative and force you to witness the film as a technical product. You think, ah! that was very clever, kudos to the person who did that. That brief moment when you couldn't care less about what is actually happening in the world of the film but only about how it was actually physically manufactured is the same feeling you get when readingHard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World. Who cares about what happens? It's more impressive to think about the fact that Murakami actually managed to write this.
