The Good:Written in an amazing mythic style, this book initially blew me away. The societies depicted weren't just modern Western cultures with bronze/iron age furniture - the setting felt like a truly ancient place shaped by geography and history, and where lack of technology actually mattered. The magic and metaphysics were freakin' sweet too.The Bad:The second half of the story really dragged, probably for a few reasons. The mythical style certainly keeps the reader at arm's length (not in itself a bad thing), however the main character also becomes increasingly alienated from the setting and the other characters, and also from the reader. Or at least from this one. Then there's the main antagonist, who lacked the substance to generate sufficient drama.'Friends' character the protagonist is most like:Ged starts off a lot like Rachel and finishes like Ross or maybe Gandalf.
