Eh, this wasn't too bad, but I don't think it was really for me and it drug quite a bit in a lot of places. I would have cut down considerably, but I think that's personal taste. I can dig fiction in the trees, and even manly man stuff now and again, but this was just too much for me where that seemed to be the sole point. I needed something to get me over those sections and instead it seemed to be much of the reason for the stories at all. I just didn't dig it that much.
