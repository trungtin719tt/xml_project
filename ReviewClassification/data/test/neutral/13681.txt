**** 4/5 ****This felt more like a long prologue, but I didn't love it any less for it. It sucked me in from page 1, and I just ordered the next two books. I am so intrigued, and time travel is seriously a lifelong dream of mine. Plus it is set in London. Seriously, what's there not to love? And a little Gideon don't hurt nobody ;)Can't wait to continue on with this series.
