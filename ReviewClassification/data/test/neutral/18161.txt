At the time of the First World War around the year 1916, an event occurred in the busy port of Piraeus, Greece quite ordinary, a chance meeting of two utterly different types of men. In a grungy sailor's cafe', Alexis Zorba 65, a Greek peasant who's seen it all, done everything imaginable good or evil, chased and caught numerous women, killed some men in and out of war, a boisterous vagabond always seeking pleasure, traveling wherever his heart desires, eating , drinking, all he can get his hands on. And a bookish quiet intellectual, a countryman with money, unnamed but Zorba calls him "Boss", at 35 looking for something meaningful to do in life, he has a Lignite ( brown coal ) mine, on the rather primitive island of Crete, awaiting a ship to take him there ( obviously based on Nikos Kazantzakis, and his friend, Giorgis Zorbas). It doesn't take much persuading by the charismatic Alexis, to be taken on the voyage, besides the Boss needs help, an experienced miner and Zorba has been one , among the countless jobs he's had. Crete is beautiful, has unspoiled sandy beaches, attractive white mountainous terrain, fertile green valleys , small rivers and lakes, also plenty of charming churches, and holy monks in monasteries, yet backward customs prevail. In the village by the mine, the poor, uneducated, almost starving people there are glad to see the mine reopened, they desperately required employment. The gregarious Zorba soon has an ancient, lonely, ailing French woman, Madame Hortense, ( foreigners are hated here) who owns and runs a battered, small inn, fall in love with the always dashing, much married , just once legally though man, he likes the ladies. And the intimidating, voluptuous "Widow," best looking woman around of course, the villagers hate her too, casting eyes on the Boss, he feels both uneasy and excited. The mine is worked hard , vigorous Zorba in command is tireless, driving the workers to dig and find the valuable coal, however after a long effort nothing can change facts, it is an unprofitable enterprise; maybe timber will be lucrative. ..The tense village hides dark violent secrets, the calm a subterfuge, only those who live inside know them. The real reason this book is still read and he easily dominates the story, is the passionate Zorba, naturally such a man...no I take that back, Zorba is a spirit , a sweeping wind an uncontrollable force, an enthusiastic flow, an enigma not really human, something that is seen but can never be wholly understood, no rules apply, this unearthly being emerges, brings energy to where it is acutely needed, then abruptly vanishes...until the next time...and for perpetuity...
