Longer than the last couple of books, better in some ways, it had multiple story lines. Sookie generally has one major issue to work through, this time she had half a dozen or so &amp; it made the book feel a bit unfocused. Not bad &amp; I'm glad I read it. It's fun, fluffy candy reading - very relaxing &amp; enjoyable. It should certainly be read in order with the rest of the series.
