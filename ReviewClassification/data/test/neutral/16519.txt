I've read a few Faulkners now and this one left the least impression upon me, and yet it was still miles ahead of other novels!William Faulkner flogs words, he teases them, he primps and preens them pretty like. You'd be hard-pressed to find a wordsmith with more range.However, compared with his other works, specificallyThe Sound and The FuryandAbsalom, Absalom, this one read like a plain old pedestrian story. It wasn't bad, it just didn't burn with the same fire as others. Still, he had the ability to make the least of his ideas a pleasure to read.Even so, I read it and I forgot it. In fact, sitting here now a few years later, I couldn't tell you the plot to this one with much detail. Hell, I'd probably get much of it wrong. In prep for this review I was going to read a synopsis ofLight in August, but then I thought, no, let this vague, forgetful impression speak for itself. Faulkner did not impress me with this one. I should let it be.
