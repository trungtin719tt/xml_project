The title refers to the death of the undead... or: dead forever.Sookie's cousin was a vampire that got killed for having a strong affiliation with the Vampire Queen of Louisiana (I know, I know!). This was mentioned in a book before, but now the issue comes to the forefront as does the plot of book 1, which started it all. We can now fit pieces of the puzzle together, and it makes more sense to visit the past than to keep on adding characters and intersecting storylines. Mrs. Harris obviously knows what she is doing.About "True Blood." (Season 1) It was nominated for the Golden Globe, despite critical blahs. My favorite episode is "The Fifth Man in the Fire" which has Sookie thinking her bf is dead, just as her grandmother. Too many bodies piling up has Tara (who makes cameos in the books, but is not a true comrade as she is on the HBO series) thinking that Sookie is trying to commit suicide by inhaling gas fumes, when in reality all she is doing is cleaning the house her grandmother always kept neat. Also, air-time of himbo Jason Stackhouse is limited (thank god), and the cemetary sex scene is HOttt. I have seen the series twice and it is quite captivating. Season 2 better be faithful to "Living Dead in Dallas", a strange sequel to a fiery start. Fellowship of the Sun, the trip to Dallas, all that better stay in. Even the maenid is introduced by Episode 10! (Exciting!)Man, I really will miss this after book 7 (I yet have to purchase the rest of the Sookie Stackhouse novels). I am entranced by this like a human would be to Bill, Eric, or any of the vampire denizens within the Charlaine Harris' Southern Vamp realm.
