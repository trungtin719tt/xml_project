I'll admit that at times I don't really understand what is going on in Pratchett books until the last 100 pages or so. A lot of times it just seems like randomness and for whatever reason, my brain likes to sift out randomness while reading. This is my second Pratchett book and I hope I find one that I end up loving. I liked Hogfather but I was expecting a little more.I think I may have made a mistake by reading this book in small chunks instead of in large chunks. Because there are no chapters and because scenes are switched very often, reading this book in small chunks was a mistake because I forgot what I read the previous day many times. So if you haven't read a Pratchett book yet, I'd recommend you spend an entire day getting down to reading it.My favorite parts of this book were any scene involving Susan and Death. These two characters were fantastic and I am looking forward to reading the previous Death books in this series. Death becoming the Hogfather was hilarious and I really liked his helper Albert. The Grim Squeaker was amazing! I was not a fan of the things going on at the university or any other point of view. These other points of view seemed to distract me from the real story. I thought that the story could have been a little bit more clear about what was happening in relation to the Hogfather and the thieves/assassin. It all came together in the end quite satisfyingly but I didn't want to be in the dark for the first 200 pages but that could have been because of my lack of focus while reading.I thought that Pratchett gave an interesting commentary about belief and that believing in the small things help individuals believe in large ideas. Pratchett was an atheist but he didn't look down on others that had faith. He saw that some people needed something to believe in to give them hope and he was alright with that. Pratchett touches on that idea within Hogfather quite a bit. Also, Pratchett touches on wealth distribution somewhat in Hogfather because the Santa Claus-like character is giving out free presents but those presents have to come from somewhere. One of the strongest examples of this is when he takes a bunch of food from a restaurant to give to a group of homeless people. The cooks at the restaurant end up having to make "book soup" like many of the homeless people did.Hogfather was a fun book that was a joy to read, had some fantastic scenes with Susan and Death, and everything came together nicely in the end, but because of my lack of focus and reading style, or possibly the lack of clarity at the beginning of the novel, had me feeling out of sorts while reading.3/52 - Plot3 - Characters3 - World Building/Setting3 - Writing Style2 - Heart &amp; Mind Aspect
