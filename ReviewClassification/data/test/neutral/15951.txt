2.5 rounded upIt's not so much that there is anything bad about this book, it is just that it is.... boring. A very large portion of the story is devoted to describing the day to day life of the characters who live in a small, seaside town. What one does as they get up, what they eat, how they cook, the routine conversations between family members, what they buy at the grocery store, which tablecloth to put out etc. etc., comprises not only most of the book, but each of our own daily lives. While familiar, it's NOT what most sit down to read about. We allliveit. It does not need to be explained to us. WeKNOWalready! Most people choose to read for an escape from the workaday life, not to endlessly re-hash it. That, along with the over-the-top climax makes this a rather disappointing attempt by a talented author.
