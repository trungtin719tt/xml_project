I'd hoped for so much more for John's story, and instead got a hot mess that was dragged down once again by so much product placement and so many damn kitchen sinks that were thrown in there. The writing is choppy and all over the place with side stories everywhere, they made my head spin.Do I believe that John and Xhex will last as a couple? Hell to the no, same with V and Jane, though I still think V and Butch should be together. For me, the only couple in this series to have the romance of the ages was Tohr and Wellsie and Ward did a number on her. Go figure!I don't want to have to slog my way through a book, and as I'm getting further into the series that's becoming the norm, so going to take a break for a while.
