They say TV and video games are a bad influence, well, this play has been corrupting minds since 1590!It's crap like this that makes people think that playing mind games with one another is the correct path to true love. It says that lying about who you are and what your intentions are, as well as flat out pretending to be something you're not, that is the way, saysThe Taming of the Shrew, to win love and warp a person into who you want them to be. Poppycock, I say!Hold on please...............just give me a sec. I'm almost off my high horse. *grunt* There we go!The Taming of the Shrewis good, solid entertainment and nothing more. You have to look at it like that or otherwise rail against its inequities towards women. It is a play of its time and it's time was not a good one for women's rights.So, as a play, this is fun. We have multiple deceptions, some for jest, some for love, and who can complain of entertainment filled with love and laughs? Few, I'm sure. This shouldn't be taken much more seriously than that. And as long as no one takes this thing seriously, it is harmless fun indeed.If for no other reason, I appreciate this play for giving me a chance to say poppycock!
