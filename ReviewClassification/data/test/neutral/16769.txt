Frankly the title has long pushed me to read this play, I expected to find stories of the kind where the storm rises and sailors must simply face it... The storm here is an entity to full respect of the past that rises from the ashes of this that moves as the storm itself and the future which is the sum of a thirst for revenge and the interpellation to indulgence... Behind the tempest hides a story, that of Master Prospero, master because he is not only the supreme chief of the island but he is also the possessor of nature, he dominates over beings and spirits, to generate a storm, in complicity of his humble servant Ariel, a spirit can incarnate in any visible or invisible thing.Behind this tempest, Prospero is the master of the game, he pulls the strings as he pleases, he moves the men, the spirits the waves like pawns that must all fall into his basket of vengeance.Banished with his daughter from Milan by his own brother and thrown like a traitor in a makeshift boat at sea, Prospero entrenched himself in this isolated island where he waged a fierce struggle with the winner Sycorax Island... While the king's ship, with all its subjects is at sea, Prospero raises a storm and let the ship be wrecked so find themselves shipwrecked on his island and he starts to run all his plans designed with delicacy...Prospero, the master of the game, divides the shipwrecked according to his objectives, in particular trains each to reveal his true nature, so one discovers of the treachery, the evil spirit of the crime, the history of the banishment of Prospero ... love too ... everything is revealed before the king ... like all the games of our master allowed each character to look in a mirror and make a retrospection.
