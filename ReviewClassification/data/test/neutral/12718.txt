Despite having a solid story that ends with a massacre, a theme that explores radical groups and the evil of humanity (not of the monsters) there are still a hundred pages left to talk about the new types of myths that are roaming the earth... Sookie's world is suddenly getting stuffy, but with each new development, the reader understands that the books will take liberties that will truly surprise. The adventures are becoming less structured... episodic. I am pretty excited to continue reading about this heroine who is becoming surprisingly less shy &amp; actually almost slutty at times. If your boyfriend was some overly attractive megasexy vampire, wouldn't you be?
