Not as fast or fun a read as the previous two books in the series. Although I'm not sure its really the book's fault. As anyone who reads multiple books at the same time can attest to, you often become more engrossed in one book and forget the other books you're reading. I also tend to read based on my mood and I'm not in a light and fun fantasy mood right now.Club Dead probably isn't any less fun a read then the first two books but my mood has changed. I've spent the last two weeks battling migraines, so I've been rather cranky and moody(I've been a huge BITCH). So I've been reading a very dark and twisted book series.I'm going to take a mini break from this series just until my mood lightens. I still plan to finish this series by the end of the year.Also I just have to mention this, Bill attempts to rape Sookie and she later apologizes to HIM. WTF???I didn't like Bill before because he was boring now I hate him. And I don't wanna hear any excuses just NO!Hooked On Books Read-A-Thon.
