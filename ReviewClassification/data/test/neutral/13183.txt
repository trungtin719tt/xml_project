I'm just confused as to why these books are so long! If I thought this would be an improvement on the first, it's not. This time there's no plot or climax whatsoever. It's about four supernatural teenagers on the run from an experimental group that was holding them hostage in the first book. Most of the second book is filler - the kids bickering, traveling to the next city by bus, losing each other and finding each other again, and subtle flirtation between Chloe (the most boring person that ever had the ability to raise the dead) and her two male comrades. The only part that adds to the storyline is when Chloe finds out that she and the other kids are part of a big supernatural experiment that could end fatally for them.Chloe spends the whole book making silly decisions based on what she thinks the others want from her. She's a serious Mary-Sue, damsel in distress type. She's not actually unlikeable because she's so nice, but she's totally useless and dull, and the boys spend the whole book falling all over themselves to try and protect her from all her stupid actions. Derek at least gets angry with her while Simon just defends everything she does and is constantly squeezing her hand and giving her reassuring looks which she desperately needs. The only person who makes any sense is Tori. She's super high maintenance and funny because she's always pointing how stupid everyone is being.Somehow I still feel that I will end up reading the last book. Despite their length, these books are still really easy to read and engaging enough to get through quickly. I mainly just want to see where they end up and who makes out with who. However, Armstrong really would have just been better off writing one decent book instead of breaking it up into three really sub par parts.
