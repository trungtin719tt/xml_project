3.5/5My doctrine has never aimed at the subjection of the understanding. All I have ever attempted to influence has been the behavior. You must not confound my meaning. I am guilty, I confess, of having often wished you to treat our acquaintance in general with greater attention but when have I advised you to adopt their sentiments or conform to their judgment in serious matters?Two-and-a-half years and two Austen lectures regarding the title at hand on (with a further one to come), my thoughts have changed, but my final rating has not. I won't be couching my criticisms with puppies and prats anymore, for I can now express my appreciations and my disturbances in far less mincing language. BothPride and PrejudiceandPersuasionattest to Austen's ability to win me over, and I have especially good feelings aboutMansfield Park, so take my criticism for what it is: the evaluation of an author's first novel upon multiple readings. Wit has become politics and ganky prats have turned into socially acceptable rapists, but that's what happens when you put lit through the academic grinder. We wouldn't still be reading Austen as a classic if her pen wasn't oftentimes a sword.Three cheers for my prof delving into the politics of 1790's England in conjunction with a character breakdown, for laws tethering together public disrespect for government with instantaneous conviction of treason puts the subtle bite ofSense and Sensibilityin an entirely new light.1984andV for Vendettadidn't spring out of thin air, and if S&amp;S' culture of espionage doesn't come across as anything out of the ordinary, that says far more about the state of your country than early 19th century English literature. Elinor picks and chooses bits of truth for her sister's own good, Sir John ensures no fresh blood will not go uninculcated, and god forbid your life doesn't completely follow the socially conforming gossip of Mrs. Jennings. The rhetoric that comes about as a result of this hang-the-Frenchy-spy is as extraordinarily subtle as it is scathing, but newspapers around this time didn't start getting taxed for no reason. Willoughby's walking free has nothing to do with respectability and everything to do with fear, and a relatively happy ending for someone with one, almost two, girlfriends in the sometimes metaphorical grave makes for an effective safety net in Austen's time and a less than cordial reception in mine.Subversion of machiavellian machinations aside, people need to start talking more about Austen's Wollstonecraftian influence and penchant for dick jokes. I'd reread P&amp;P forever without awareness of either, but the point is a variety of juicy paradigms to sink one's teeth into that can forever fend off the likes of Twain and co. Other than that, I'll be watching a movie of this work for extra credit. Alan Rickman, you will be missed.---8/19/133.5/5The whole of Lucy's behaviour in the affair, and the prosperity which crowned it, therefore, may be held forth as a most encouraging instance of what an earnest, an unceasing attention to self-interest, however its progress may be apparently obstructed, will do in securing every advantage of fortune, with no other sacrifice than that of time and conscience.I will admit to thinking long and hard on whether to delegate this book's rating to a mere three stars in the standardized counter, detailing to be in reality a 3.5 within the review. However, every time I came close to deciding on that for good, a feeling was produced akin to as if I had watched the most adorable of puppies cavort in an elegantly precise fashion, a puppy that upon sensing my being unimpressed with said cavortingshid itself in a corner and curled into a ball of sadness. Needless to say, I reconsidered my decision, and while I ultimately decided to go through with it, I must say I am confident that most would find it a four star.Call me overly vindictive, but I extremely dislike it when ganky prats don't get their comeuppance in any sort of fiction. To be fair, I am likely to forgive them their insipid brattishness if the author expands on the realities of the society and/or the character's first point perspective motivations to a decent enough extent for their actions to make sense. Austen made an effort with both, fortunately with the former far exceeding the latter to the point that I decided not to lower my rating simply because a few of the snobs could have benefited from some therapy of the vivisectional kind. A bit brutal, to be sure, but true. Also, the plot and all its convolutions in an effort to adhere to ridiculous principles of the time was a bit much, but as I'm not a big fan of reasonable plots in general, that point of discontent is on my head entirely.Despite all that, I have to consider the time and place of Austen's writing. The above quote pretty much sums up the reality of her situation, which I must recognize as historical fact as much as it grates on my nerves to do so. And if there's one thing she does exceedingly well, it is her weaving of stories as closely within the web of conventions and social sensibilities that existed in her time period as satire does, without breaking any of the lines. Mocking something is easy. Mocking it in such a smartly sensitive and hilarious sensible manner is another thing entirely, no matter how much acquiescence to certain past customs rubs me the wrong way.Also, her prose? Well structured to a delicate laced and filigreed tee, without a loose thread or runny stitch to be seen. While I do love my rambling crescendos of prose whose glorious profundity is tied up with its intrinsic chaos, I have to give a nod to masterful efforts of making sentences cooperate with each other in such well behaved fashions. Every time I happened to wonder on a particular tidbit that hadn't been fully explicated, behold! It appeared by the end of the paragraph. Didn't leave much room for anchorless contemplation, but that's hardly a matter for faulting a piece of literature.And finally, it was witty, it was adorable, there was a happy ending, and ultimately I was left with a warm and fuzzy feeling. Considering how many issues I have with achieving said warm and fuzzy feeling, I'm not about to criticize something that enables such any more than I need to. That would not only be a case of being unimpressed with the puppy, it would be one ofkickingthe puppy. As vindictive I am, that is simply not cool.
