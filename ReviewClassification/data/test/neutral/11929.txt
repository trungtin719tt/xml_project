Honestly, I must be crazy to dive into anotherre-readover my weekend rather than crack open one of the other million new reads that await me. But here I am having given myself over to 979 pages of my least favorite book in theOutlanderseries.Major Warning: If you have not read the four preceding books or if you have only watched the first three seasons of the television show..don't peek at this review. Spoliers are aheadFirst a confession, I haven't read this book as many times as its predecessors. In fact, this might be only the third time I have ever gone back to book 5.Because not a lot of major plot development occurs in comparison to its predecessors.Let's review...Outlander20th century woman finds herself back in 18th century Scotland. Falls in love with sexy virgin, has to be rescued many, many times from Highland superstitions and sadistic English officer who actually bears a striking relationship to 20th century husband. Possibly more than one person has also come through the stones.Dragonfly in Ambershocking beginning, glamorous France, heartache, strife, Rising, horrible separation.VoyagerHe's alive. She goes back. Lots of secrets. Constant action. A prophecy is at play.Drums of Autumnnew life on America, Brianna finds out something. Roger runs after her. A dastardly villain named Stephen Bonnet stirs up trouble for the Frasers. More reunions, questions, family.So then we getThe Fiery Crossand I swear that Diana Gabaldon is one of my favorites, but I still think she almost killed me with this book. IMHO, it's theA Feast for Crowsfor the Outlander series. Most of the time is spent on the war of Regulation in North Carolina, a point of history that neither Claire nor Brianna remember from Bree's textbooks and is part of the colony's history. Yet, it wasn't nearly as exciting as some of the other stuff that happens around that time frame especially for dear Roger.The first seventeen chapters are taken up at the Gathering, there is plenty of running around looking for people and our two main couples dashing into bushes for sexual interludes. A theme that basically runs all through the novel. The Stephen Bonnet storyline is still going strong and Roger almost gets killed by one of his direct ancestors. Perhaps the saving grace of the novel is that Jamie and Roger's relationship gets stronger and DG cooks up a great scene for Claire, Brianna, and the very underused Marsali. Oh and Jamie turns 50! Basically this book could be referred to as the "bridge" because the characters of the Beardsley twins and the arrival of Tom Christie and his family to the Ridge are basically all going to be relatively important in book 6,A Breath of Snow and Ashes.Based on my opinions and this re-read my 3.0 star rating holds strong. I am also watching the show and hope that the show's writers will bring their A game to giving this story a little bit of oomph come Season 5.
