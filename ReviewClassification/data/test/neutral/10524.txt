Update Feb 2017Lowering my rating to 3 stars since I think 4.5 was super duper generous4.5*I just didn't really love it as much as I had thought I would. Another case of a book being too hyped up for it to possibly live up to my expectations unfortunately.That being said I did still really enjoy it and thing it was a beautiful story, pretty similar to some other books I've read though.
