It's difficult for me to judge this book on its own merit and not have it suffer in comparison toA Room with a ViewandMaurice, two books by Forster I recommend. But this book, while interesting at times and full of insights into human nature, as well as it being a meditation on a changing England at the beginning of the twentieth century, fell short for me. Most of the characters were unlikable or unsympathetic people who were either self-centered snobs or well meaning, but clueless about others, especially those not of their own class. I felt the author created them that way to show a certain realism and to show strife on a low simmer between the various classes during that time in English society, setting up a story to have them collide in often improbable ways.There were The Wilcoxes who owned a home in the countryside called Howards End and were well to do business owners and non intellectuals. There were The Schlegels, cultured intellectuals of German and English descent who were comfortable financially due to inherited money. They met The Wilcoxes on holiday one year and met their fate. And finally, there were The Basts, relatively poor and yearning for a better life financially, and in the case of Mr. Bast, hoping for a richer life culturally. They intersected with the other two families and unknowingly acted as catalysts for what was to come. Through a series of chance encounters and later, chosen ones, they all affected each other for better or worse as they mingled.Running throughout this story was a heavy handed message about the disintegration of an English way of life formerly based on the land and the disintegration of the souls of people along with it, for those who failed to connect, not only with the land, but with one another and with themselves. The intent of this story, as I saw it, to enlighten and to warn, was a worthy one and kept my interest, but the messages the author wished to convey became repetitive, the story manipulated by him, with one disaster after another befalling the characters or disastrous decisions by them used to illustrate the themes. In a word, this story felt calculated and became muddled, leaving me dissatisfied, even though I admired the keen observations of the author and his intent to enlighten people by showing them at their worst. I wish I could say I thoroughly enjoyed this book, in honor of an author I respect, but by the end, it had become a depressing soap opera and something to endure.
