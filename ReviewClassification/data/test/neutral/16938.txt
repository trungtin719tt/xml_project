Actual rating: 3.5 StarsI took me a bit longer to get into this book thanGone Girl, but I still enjoyed it.I had some problems with the main character at the beginning. I found her quite unsympathetic. I got used to her throughout the book though, and I do think she had a good amount of character development. Unfortunately, some of the side characters left me feeling a bit unsatisfied. I would have loved more information and a better look into their thoughts and feelings.The ending came a bit too quick for me as well...
