What can I say that hasn't been said?The action was good, not great, but good. At the end it got way better, but still not as good as some books I gave 4 stars in UF. Some parts were really slow, specially at the beginning. And the fact that it has no romance at all was something that bothered me. It's not only that it has no romance, she doesn't even get interested in someone.I was expecting much more form this book as everybody was talking about this series, I mean it was a good read, and reading about witches is something new for me. I like it, and I definitely will be reading the next book.I was really fond of the bad guy as a possible lover for her, I don't know why because he treats her like sh*t, but he was the most interesting character in the book.
