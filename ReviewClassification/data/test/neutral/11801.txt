This is my first Nicholas Sparks book and it's exactly what I expected, a chick lit romance. Which is fine, because that's what I was looking for.Reasons I enjoyed the read..1. I seem to enjoy books that feel like fate or destiny. It gives a magical feel to the book. When events occur because the universe, something beyond our control willed it to happen. Sparks does this when Theresa finds that message in a bottle. A love letter that is so powerful that you cannot ignore it after you've read it. A letter that is from the heart and soul bearing. This letter leads her to an adventure she has been craving and a love that she has been yearning for. A message in a bottle that sailed the waves of the ocean to end up to the right reader at the right time.2. It was realistic. Obviously a message in a bottle that brings people together seems unlikely, however the story felt believable. Plus don't you want that in a romance? Life is messy and when books portray that mess, it makes it more relatable. The characters, Theresa and Garret have demons of their own. They both need to face them, before their routes can truly align with one another.Reasons I did not like the book...1. The ending. I don't want to explain why, because I do not want to spoil the book for anyone who reads this. I understand why the author wrote the ending to this book, but I wish it was different.2. The characters bugged me. Theresa more so, she seemed manipulative.3. The instant love. I just do not see how you can fall love within a week. Especially with the pasts and demons the character themselves were facing. I guess I'm not as much of a romantic as Sparks is.All in all it was a good book (3.5 stars) and I will probably read another one of Sparks' books when the time is right.
