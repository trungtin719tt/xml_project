I was a big fan of this series starting out, as I thought it was innovative and interesting, with a great pairing of vampire myth and magic. I still like those pieces, but my enjoyment of the series is being tried a bit with these latest installments.I feel like characterization has taken a hike somewhere along the way, as most of the characters seem to have become rather stagnant. As far as the main characters, it seems like we've reached somewhat of a standstill. On the one hand, Zoey is now starting to see who she belongs with, thankfully, as she's spent the majority of the series flip-flopping back and forth between her many guys. So I am glad to see this part somewhat resolving itself. Stark has always been an interesting character to me and I still love him. He's strong, he cares about Zoey, and I like where his story is going as far as his role as her guardian.My favorite character in the story, however, is Kolona, as he has the most to learn, to change, to grow, etc. I see great potential and possibility in where his story might be headed.What did I like about this installment: I like where Kalona and Stark are going. I think this is a unique twist that might be developing here, and I have hope that Kalona is actually going to end up reconciling with Nyx. Although this is purely speculation for me.What I did not like was that we don't seem to be advancing too much in the overall story. I didn't really buy the idea that everyone's believing Neferet might be innocent. She threw out some rather silly and childish explanations for her actions and then everyone believed her except for Zoey's small group of friends? I just don't buy that they're the only ones who would be able to think and reason their way through this. The explanations are simple enough that a child could see through them.I'm rapidly reaching the point where I want to see the resolution for this story. I feel like things are being stretched just for the sake of seeing the story keep going. I am not quite ready to quit the series, but I do hope we can see a nice, strong wrap-up fairly soon. I think the authors are dragging things out too much at this point.The authors are very talented and great story tellers. This installment of the series, however, fell a little flat for me. I'm looking forward to seeing things pick up from here.
