I found out after I finished the book that Caleb Carr started off by writing historical non-fiction and that he even firstpitched this book as non-fiction, afraid that his editor and publisher wouldn't accept a work of fiction from a non-fiction writer.I mention this because I feel that his background in non-fiction shows through in the writing style - including the descriptions of the city and places in the city itself which I felt were more textbook than evocative. (Granted, judging by the reviews I'm in a clear minority on this point.)Anyway - I was worried, initially, when reading the book because the first several chapters didn't grab me. I found them rather boring, actually, and was afraid I was going to hate the book.(ETA: One thing that kept bugging me was the fact that the narration kept alternating between using first name and last name. For example: "Kreizler switched off the desk lamp and sat back down. I took a blind stab and guessed that the quote was from the Bible, to which Laszlo nodded, remarking..." I found it distracting and jarring, especially during the slow bits.)But once the case got going, the book hit a better stride, and I started quite enjoying the discussions of psychology and the budding forensic field. (Side note to delicate readers - he does go into a fair bit of description about the dead bodies as well as the various methodologies, and some scenes could be rather disturbing for some people.)Actually, at a point a little less than half-way through I decided that the book read more like a true-crime story than a crime drama/thriller, and once I shifted my expectations in that direction I enjoyed it a good deal more - but I think it really helped that I find psychology to be interesting.The reason why I found it easier to read as true-crime instead of crime drama, though, is because other aspects of the story were a bit lacking - like character development, for instance.But then the book stopped focusing on long discussions of said psychology and forensics, tried for a bit of suspense and action (which is did a fair job of), but then it settled back down into a bit of a slog.Arguably the slog is done on purpose, as its during a downturn in the investigation, but there's also some character drama which happens which didn't quite have the emotional impact on me it ought to have because I never really connected with the characters as people so once the focus kind of shifted to that again, instead of the investigative techniques, my interest started waning again. Also, when it did focus on the psychology and whatnot it felt very repetitive in these sections - like we just kept rehashing the same things we discussed at length earlier on.It picked up towards the end - but I had a bit of an issue with the way the reader is brought along the investigation the whole time only to be left in the dark towards the end so that we could be wowed by the various happenings.Aside from that, one thing which kept popping into my head was the fact that the whole thing's a bit far-fetched. Of course, we accept a certain level of outlandishness in crime dramas but here, perhaps because it's presented in such a factual manner, I sometimes had a hard time swallowing that they really were able to figure out as much as they did working from the methods they had. Many of the suppositions were so dead on as to be beyond the pale - and even those which were wrong ended up being at least a little bit valid.Maybe it's because my husband informed me, while I was reading the book, about an article he'd read awhile back which called into question the validity of psychological profiling, and which pointed out that for the few cases were it seems to work, there are a lot of other cases where the profile has been flat out wrong or too vague to be helpful. So I kept finding myself wondering at the level of detail they were able to glean from their profiling, and whether it fell outside of all realms of credulity or not.Though since they did back it up with good old fashioned detective work, as it were - and since itisfiction - I'm willing to give it a pass.
