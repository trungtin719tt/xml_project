Oh wow, these were beautiful. Most of them I didn't understand but the language was beautfiul.I still have to film a review for this and I'm just really intimidated, dear God, how am I to make sense of these!I don't have the book at hand (whilst writing this review) but the two lines that stuck out to me the most were:Not from the stars do I my judgement pluck;And yet methinks I have Astronomy,Gaah it's just so beautiful. But yeah, let's get this review going.There are 154 sonnets in this collection and they all tie in together. As if Shakespeare was trying to tell a story or rather to show the development of love in the life of a specific young gentlemen. The first 127 are adressed to that young man. Shakespeare is trying to persuade him to marry and make lots and lots of babies so that the young man's beauty is immortalized in his children.I found that very interesting. That this fear of ageing and getting wrinkles and a sagging body were so present in the 1600s. Shakespeare really idolizes Youth and Beauty and emphasizes how important it is that those shouldn't be lost. It was rather depressing.He then moves on to talk about love in general. And jealousy. And lust. And all the messages are wrapped in complex and beautiful language that I really enjoyed reading this out loud, but most of the time their message remained hidden to me. I don't like to look up interpretations and explanations when it comes to poetry because I think that poetry is a very personal matter between the poet and each reader. And if I didn't "get" the poems on my first read-through, I'm perfectly fine with that. Then that's how this was meant to be. And I'm meant to re-visit this sonnets over time and maybe find reasoning in them when I'm myself old and wrinkly.Some of these poems were also rather "meta". By that I mean that Shakespeare wrote about immortalizing himself in his poems because his poems will live on and be remembered in the future when he's been dead for hundreds of years. And boy, was he right! I thought that was really interesting that Shakespeare intentionally tried to live on as a legend.The last 28 poems are adressed to a woman. This woman is clearly and object of desire and set off some hardcore BDSM vibes. :D Being referred to as "the Dark Mistress" and bringing pain to her lovers. I was rather appaled. ;)But I really appreciated the last two Sonnets (#153 and #154) because I think that the quintessential message of the Sonnets lays in these two and their message was rather clear:Love is love is love is loveCannot be killed or swept aside
