I just have to continue this series to see what happens to Kalona. I hope Zoey dies in this one....UPDATE:So I've made my disdain for Zoey quite clear. So why do I keep reading this? Simple - the plot is actually really good. I really enjoy the Kalona and Neferet story arc, and I REALLY liked that we finally got some chapters from other character's perspectives.The beginning of this book was hard for me to get through, though. I'm sorry, but the Zoey-going-out-of-her-way-not-to-cuss thing is getting RIDICULOUS. It would be one thing if the authors were trying to prove a point that they don't have to cuss to sell books. But that's not the case, as every other character drops constant f-bombs. So Zoey saying things like, "I'm sorry I dragged you into all this poo" and "That's a bunch of bullpoopie" is just downright ridiculous. She can't even say the word crap? Or crud? Or ANYTHING other than bullpoopie? It is just really ridiculous, and drags me out of the plot everytime she says it.I was happy this book focused less on her guy problems, though. I laughed my butt off when Eric said, "I'm sick of you cheating on me with everyone who has a dick." HAHAHA! Even the characters in the book think she is a hoe!But even with all my ranting, the last half of the book was awesome, and I couldn't put it down. And thanks a lot, for ending the book so ambiguously that I am now actually excited to read the next one.
