3 " I completely get if you rated it 1, 2, 3, 4 or even 5" stars !!!For the first time ever (in the history of my reading life) I would understand completely any rating for this book. I thought long and hard and for me it was a strong three star that could have been a four star but wasn't for a number of factors.First of all the writing is terrific. Vivid and robust and hyper-masculine prose with dialogue and thought patterns that zing and sing. I was able to see in my mind's eye what was occurring in the exterior landscape as well as in the protagonist's consciousness. The material was fairly original and very clever. The protagonist has been described as a teenage psychopath which I think is too simplistic and I think this is a very accurate portrayal of teenager who because of trauma, isolation and benign neglect has developed a very complex schizotypal personality disorder whereas his brother has a very severe case of paranoid schizophrenia.Whoa Jaidee, you make this sound like a four star read at least. Why the three ?Well for a number of reasons1. there is just too much animal cruelty...at times it appears gratuitous rather than allegorical2. the last ten percent was a complete and ridiculous sell out to me with a dumb and I mean dumb shocker as well as the last few pages were a very limp psychological explanation of why the protagonist behaved as he did3. I cannot believe reason two happened....really I can't and in some ways makes me want to give the book 2 stars butI know this would be completely unfair and so I am going to stick to 3 strong stars.I am very glad I read this book for the vivid brilliance but also am very sore at the author for the ending which was just oh so lame !!
