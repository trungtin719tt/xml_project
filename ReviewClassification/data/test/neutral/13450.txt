The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is like a comfortable old shoe. I've read the thing multiple times - the first when I was maybe twelve or thirteen. I know every nook and cranny of the book; however, like an old shoe, it's no longer shiny and new - it even stinks a little bit. Fortunately, like an old shoe, it feels good reading it and that is enough.The story is about a handful of souls, well, really two - Manuel (a.k.a., Man) and Mike (a.k.a., Mycroft Holmes) - who are drawn into a rebellion against Earth. What's neat about the whole thing is that Mike is, in fact, not a person at all. He is a H.O.L.M.E.S. ("High-Optional, Logical, Multi-Evaluating Supervisor") Mark 4, a super computer that has unexpectedly become conscious and self-aware. The relationship between Mike and Man is well worth the price of admission. And as far as characters go, the real star of the show. He moves from playful, almost childlike to a mature well-adjusted adult in just a few hundred pages.Where the story suffers, I think, is in the fairly linear plot. There are no questions where things are headed from almost the get-go. Moreover, the book shamelessly co-opts from the American Revolution - even going so far as to steal from the Declaration of Independence. (Even the dates line up against 1776.) The book is, at its heart, a light-hearted romp but that's OK. Sometimes you want to slip on that old shoe.Three and a half stars rounded down to three. Even the big nostalgia boost couldn't get me to bump it up higher.
