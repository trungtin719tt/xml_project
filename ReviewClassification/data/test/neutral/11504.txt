This book is only for people who enjoy the characters and the America they inhabit. It is a series of incidents following familiar themes of kidnapping and rescue, disaster and salvation, sickness and carefully recaptured health, accusation and jail. Secrets are discovered and shared, there's sex scenes and a rape scene as another Fraser family member takes their improbable turn again as victim (what are the chances that three members of a family would be raped, one twice?)Finally,a decision is made that splits the family...The author appears to fully expect to continue the series but after reading of Jamie and Claire at advanced age I had to go and skim the first book to reminsce and pity the characters for losing so much of their youth together to vicious circumstance.
