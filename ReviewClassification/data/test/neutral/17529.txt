When I started out reading this series, a friend warned me that some books would be heavily impacted by Christian notions. Now, this is not a bad thing per se but I tend to struggle with books that focus too much on religious aspects. I thought the worst was behind me when I finished book 3. Book 4 (The Tale of the Body Thief) was amazing and I had great hopes for book 5.A book that features 'devil' in its title might easily be about religion but I wasn't prepared for the amount of theological discussion that was thrown my way.Let's be honest, the first half of the book was pretty amazing. Lestat, being his obsessive self, still struggles with the happenings surrounding the Body Thief while he stalks his newest victim. Getting closer to his next kill he notices someone following him with heavy steps. Steps belonging to the devil and he needs to ask himself 'What does a vampire do when the devil chases him?'I enjoyed my time with this part of the story. Unfortunately, the pacing took a turn for the worse when they started to go through basically thousands of years of religious development. While this crash course did hold some interesting aspects, I don't want to read chapter after chapter about it.About 75% in the book I understood that this book was the build-up for the next one. I was disappointed because I was looking forward to the solution. I hope I get to read the next book soon because I might forget all about this one soon.Nevertheless, Lestat is still a pretty cool character - I like his way of looking at things. Always falling way too quickly for any kind of obsession and ignoring every rational voice around him. In this regard, David is one of my favorite characters.To be honest, I'm torn about Memnoch - something between 'He's a bore' and his character holds a lot of potentials.I'm still looking forward to the next book in the series and hope that it will focus more on those aspects that I love about the series.
