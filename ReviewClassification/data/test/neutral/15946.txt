Buddy Read withMegha,Anu,Adita,ParthoandRohisa.Well this is the book which inspired all the dystopian novels that came along, especially 1984. You can imagine my excitement that I was finally going to read the father of all dystopian novels.I have to start by making a comparison to 1984, there is a shocking similarity between the worlds-(view spoiler)[The controlled environment, the whole story from the perspective of a protagonist scared to go against rules, a woman whose involvement makes the protagonist do things he wouldn't have otherwise dreamed off.(hide spoiler)]I was a bit disappointed with 1984 after reading this because it is very clear from where the idea for 1984 came from. It pretty much took this book as an instruction manual. But 1984 corrected all the things that went wrong with this story and hence 1984 is a superior read (at least for me)The writing of this book is unique. The whole book is written in mathematical interpretation and I know some of my friends found this difficult or boring to read but for me this worked out perfectly. I found the writing interesting and different (good different).This whole concept of not having any individualism and following a set pattern is horrifying and intriguing all in one go. It makes you want to break the mold and live differently. Makes me clearly realize why this book was banned in Russia soo long ago - as this was published in 1924 (right around the time Russia became a communist country).The main problem with this book is it lacks the urgency that is expected in a dystopian novel. I took around 14 days to read this which is a long time as per my reading speed but this is because this is a slow paced novel (which can be disappointing to people used to reading fast paced dystopia novels).In spite of the slow read, overall I liked this book and hence the 3 stars.
