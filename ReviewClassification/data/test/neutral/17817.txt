Tales of H.P. LovecraftWritten by Lovecraft, stories selected by Joyce Carol Oates and forward.Read it in Paper-back and came in at 328 (not counting forward or 'reader's helper' at the end.I won't go into any details of Lovecraft, or his unfortunate life. All of that is pretty well documented and can be found via a Wikki or Internet search. One thing that should be mentioned however is that he is considered the father of Weird Fiction, with a lot of authors claiming influential ties to his work.I have wanted to read a collection of his work for some time but had never quiet committed, till now. Whatever collection I chose only had one stipulation, that it contained At The Mountains of Madness. Thus when perusing I found this edition, which met said criteria, and threw it on the stack to eat up some day. That day was last month.-Potential Spoilers Below-Introduction - Nothing new in the intro. Joyce sums up Lovecraft's life and makes inferences to his writing potential and her own and others experiences with his writing. Probably can skip unless you have a lot of interest into Lovecraft or really want Joyce's opinion on the matter. In no way does Joyce cover some of the shady attributes of Lovecraft characters, but there is nothing to gain from defaming the dead.The Outsider - First published in Weird Tales in 1921. In this tale a man who has been stuck in a castle/tower for as long as he can remember finally breaks free in search of others. Overall I felt it was a little light on substance, but perfect for a magazine which obviously was the target. Short and weird enough to hold interest and was probably a great selection for a first story but no real conclusion.The Music of Erich Zann - First published in 1922 follow a man who's neighbor plays for a shady crowd and he is determined to see what all of the ruckus is about. Once again, it leads nicely but ended without satisfaction.The Rats in The Walls - Also published in Weird Tales circa 1923. Longer than the two above, The Rat in the Walls follows a families attempt to restore a lost castle estate and change the shadowy legacy of the place. This was a nice change from the two previous stories and while it does not add much in terms of long term fulfillment, it was a good read.The Shunned House - First published in Weird Tales in 1937 while originally written in 1924. A house with an unusual stain and clouded history. Out damn spot. The whole time I read this story, all I could think of was "that will teach you not to clean next time you spill something."The Call of Cthulhu - Written in 1926 and first published in Weird Tales in 1928. The story that's probably gotten more infamous than it deserves. The story itself is short, blabbers on with no proper structure and then ends. I get it, Cthulhu is cool and all. He's big and leathery, has tentacles for a face, is infinitely old and will chase you while you dream. It's a terrifying concept and it's grand. Looking at the scope of the mythos he was trying to create I can definitely say that this was an important story, but on its own I was simply not impressed.The Colour Out of Space - Written and published in 1927 to Amazing Stories. The story of a small family who witnesses a meteorite strike on their land which subsequently ushers in some unfortunate events for them and the community. This is one of my favorite stories in this collection.The Dunwich Horror - Written in 1928 and published to Weird Tales in 1929. This tale follows the strange events of family named the Whateley's. Wilbur, the newest addition to the family is not normal and matures very quickly and is soon shunned by the town. Wilbur pursues his grandfather's dark arts. I really liked this story.At the Mountains of Madness - Written in 1931, Weird Tales originally declined to publish on the merits of length and wouldn't be published until 1936 by Astounding Stories. At the Mountains of Madness follows an Antarctic Expedition in which they find some peculiar things and meet tragedy. This is my favorite story in the whole collection. Lovecraft had the page count to elaborate and build the overarching mythos put forth in almost all of his tales.The Shadow Over Innsmout - First written in 1931 and published in 1936. A young man travels to Innsmout with great curiosity in the fields of architecture and antiquarian and the town is fabled with both. Upon traveling to the town he soon realizes that much of the legends surrounding the town are in fact true and horrifying. Faced with his impending death, he must flee the town.The Shadow Out of Time - First published in 1936 in Astounding Stories. A not so conventional story of possession. The Shadow Out of Time sees a man 'body swapped' with a strange creature. During this time the possessed body does many strange things and the host is written off as crazy all but abandoned by his family, save one son. Upon the return to his body he begins to fill the gaps and try to discover what he has done during his lost years.-End Spoilers-This took me much longer to read than I anticipated and I am not sure if it was the structure, word choice, and embellishment of his writing style or my simple constant failings at reading short story collections that are cause for the long completion. Overall I guess I enjoyed it but often found myself having to re-read paragraphs. Mr. Lovecraft isn't always the most clearest writer.Out of the collection, The Rats in The Walls, The Colour Out of Space, At the Mountains of Madness, The Shadow Over Innsmout, and The Shadow Out of Time were my favorite stories. It appears that Mr. Lovecraft was robbed of the opportunity for a proper novel, with only At the Mountains of Madness being the closest thing in duration. This is a shame I think and I would love to have seen what he could have done with the opportunity to pull all of his developing mythos, present and building in the shorts, into a true book. It could have been grand.I guess I liked 50% of the stories, so for Goodreads, it will get a solid 3 stars from me.
