12/07/2012I will not lose my mind.I will not lose my mind.Iwill notlose my mind.I will survive the pain caused by Opal.I'm strong. I will be stronger.This will be my mantra until the release of Origin. I will repeat these sentences every day. It's all I can do even if I have a feeling this will not be enough.In Opal there's all I ever wanted for Daemon and Katy and more. So much more.I tought I have really known Daemon in Onyx but he is full of surpraises. Prepare yourself for a romantic Daemon. You will fall deeper and deeper in love with him.And Kat, oh Kat, after the end of Onyx she became a stroger person. In some ways different from the Kat we met in Odsidian and in some way the same as always. She will understand what people can do for the ones they love. She is perfect for Daemon and Daemon is perfect for her.Reading the book you will be overwhelmed by a flood of emotins. It's the kind of book where you will drop everything you were doing to read it. You will cry tears of joy. You will smile. You will get angry. You will tear your hair. You will think 'this can't be the end. Just can't'.(view spoiler)[Using Jenni words there is a brutal cliffhanger ending. Really really really brutal.(hide spoiler)]Why Jenni?Why are you doing this to your beloved fans? You shattered my heart into tiny pieces.I think I will never be the same again.Jennifer L.
