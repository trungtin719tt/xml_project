The madness continues in the 5th installment of the Southern Vampire/Detective series. All the characters we know and love are here, &amp; even more are added to the mix (!).Though its soapy and corny at times, all the twists and turns are definitely unexpected. You have no clue what will happen, and even when the murderer/villain comes to the forefront, is killed off, etc. there is still much more to the story than just that. The payoff is not the identity of the whodidit or even the motive (we can all agree that that isn't even important), but the strange couplings and even stranger liaisons between vamps, shapeshifters, Weres, fairies, etc. that flabbergast anyone who's followed the intrepid series.Sookie is indeed unlike any heroine before seen. She is dumb, but has amazing tact (duh- she's telepathic). Her friends AND foes list keeps getting longer and longer. Something must be said about the addictive nature of these tall tales...
