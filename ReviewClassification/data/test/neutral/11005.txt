Artfully Told Tale of Academics, Victorian Poets and RomanceI wanted to like this book more than I actually did.Many Goodreaders really like this metafictional novel, which contains a story (and poetry) within a story.There is much to admire here.The author skillfully interweaves two time periods. One was 1987 (close to the time the novel was written), the other nineteenth century Victorian England.She not only invents two poets, but writes a lot of their poetry. The skill and brilliance involved here is astonishing.But...Most of the characters (with a couple of exceptions) left me cold.And I found both the Victorian romance and its poetry cloying, like overly sweet pastries, though I suppose this style was typical of the time.And the more contemporary romance was rather chilly.The book's title, "Possession", has many meanings. It refers to the possession of romantic love, ownership of precious objects, and the almost demonic possession that can take over those on a quest.The 1987 timeline involves a gaggle of academics. All of them are scholars of Victorian poets and writers. The author gently mocks the academics and their obsessions with ideas no one else cares about. At the same time, she makes the professors believable and very human characters.The focus of the novel are two fictional Victorian poets.One, Randolph Henry Ash, married to Ellen Ash, is considered one of the greatest poets of his time.The other, Christabel LaMotte, is less well known, primarily because she is a woman. She is also a closeted lesbian, living quietly with her lover, Blanche Glover on Mount Ararat Road in Richmond in London.Apparently LaMotte is based on real pre-Raphaelite poetess Christina Rossetti, although I much prefer Rossetti's poetry to LaMotte's. Plus their looks are different. Christina, although apparently a beautiful woman, had Italian coloring---dark hair and olive skin (orso it seems in the pictures of her). LaMotte has very fine light blonde hair (described as containing multiple shades of blonde) and fair skin.After writing each other a series of remarkable letters, which seem to be very much in the style of the time,(view spoiler)[(with only the coyest and most covert allusions to anything sexual), LaMotte and Randolph Ash have a brief affair, which wreaks havoc on almost everyone around them (particularly in LaMotte's case).Ellen Ash figures out what happened but keeps it to herself until her dying husband tells her about it many years later.(hide spoiler)]LaMotte seeks refuge with relatives on the Brittany coast. Her cousin Sabine also keeps a journal of the time.(view spoiler)[Christabel LaMotte, although clearly pregnant, disappears from her relatives' house and delivers her child in secret. No one discovers what has become of the child until years later.(hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[Blanche commits suicide by jumping into the ice cold Thames River with stones sewn into her pockets.(hide spoiler)]The academics in the 1987 timeline are all experts in LaMotte, Randolph Ash, or Ellen Ash (Randolph Ash's wife), who kept a journal.Roland Michell is an unknown London scholar. He is a quiet and reserved young man. In the London library in a book by Vico (presumably Giambattista Vico, the eighteenth century Italian philosopher and historian) he accidentally stumbles on some letters of Ash. They seem to be drafts of secret love letters. Roland uncharacteristically pockets the letters. He keeps his find secret.Roland lives with Val, a woman he met in college. The live in a crumby basement room that reeks of cat urine, and Val supports Roland. Neither of them are terribly happy with the situation or with each other.Fergus, a fellow scholar, refers Roland to Maud Bailey. (Maud had a romance with Fergus). Maud is an established authority on LaMotte.(view spoiler)[ She is also related to LaMotte, although the nature of her relationship to LaMotte becomes clearer later in the book(hide spoiler)]Maud is a beautiful, cold, and extremely reserved woman. She keeps her beautiful blonde hair under a head wrap. She is also a very competent scholar.Maud gets infected with enthusiasm for Roland's quest to find out what happened between Ash and LaMotte. The two of them decide to disappear for awhile on a secret quest to find out more about the connection between Ash and LaMotte.Other scholars get involved, some at Roland and Maud's request, others simply because they "pick up the scent" of an exciting hunt.Beatrice Nest is a scholar who specializes in the journals of Ellen Ash, Randolph Ash's wife. Maud enlists her help. Beatrice is a hesitant, prudish woman who is ashamed of her large breasts and big body. She's older (over fifty?) Beatrice feels protective towards Ellen Ash. She's not sure she wants Ellen's secrets to be exposed to public scrutiny. Roland is irritated by Beatrice's slowness. Surprisingly, Maud takes to Beatrice.Leonora Stern, a feminist professor from Tallahassee, Florida, is another expert on Christabel LaMotte. She shows up unbidden at Maud's apartment, to Maud's annoyance. Leonora has heard rumors about new discoveries on LaMotte. Leonora can be obnoxious and irritating, but still she is one of my favorite characters. She is larger than life. Proudly full figured, flamboyant, omnisexual (she is mostly lesbian but seems to be open to any type of sexual partner), she is resplendent and she knows it and plays it up. She dresses in bright colors and outrageous hippie clothing. She writes about female sexuality in LaMotte's poetry. She also tends to butt in where she isn't wanted. Of course, she is one of the characters that was not included in the Hollywood movie.James Blackadder is Roland's estwhile boss. He is a dour Scot, who turns out to not be as curmudgeonly as he seems to be. Roland works for him at his so-called "Ash Factory" in the British Museum. He is another of my favorite characters. Of course, he was cut out of the Hollywood movie as well.The last professor is Professor Mortimer Cropper, the man everyone loves to hate. He curates the Stant Collection at the fictictious Robert Dale Owen University in the apparently made up town of Harmony City, New Mexico. He greedily snatches up historical objects of interest (usually curios associated with famous writers). He wants all the Randolph Ash memorabilia he can get his hands on. The other professors all loathe him. He is not above using illegal and immoral methods to get his hands on objects he wants for the Stant Collection (or for his own secret personal collection, which he is rumored to hide in his home). He is lean and lithe and drives a Mercedes, as he has inherited wealth.Other characters include Sir George Bailey and his disabled wife Joan. (Apparently they belong to another branch of Maud's family and may be distant relatives of hers); and Euan MacIntyre, a solicitor (British lawyer).While I admired the scholarship, work, and artistry involved in putting this long novel together, as I've already mentioned, I have some reservations about it.For one thing, I didn't think Ash and particularly LaMotte were terribly sympathetic characters. Christabel LaMotte wreaks havoc on literally everyone around her, and while she does express remorse for this, it seems like too little too late. Her behavior completely turns off her French cousin Sabine, who is actually a more sympathetic character that Christabel is.For another thing, I wasn't wild about the poetry of either Ash or LaMotte, although part of my problem with their writings might have been the way the audio reader, Virginia Leisham, read them.Finally, I found many of the 1987 characters to be a bit chilly, although as I mentioned, Leonora and Blackadder are colorful.Virginia Leisham's reading of the audio didn't help matters. She gave Cropper, who's from New Mexico, an inexplicable stagey Southern accent that would have been more suitable for a production of "The Glass Menagerie" than for a guy who grew up in the Southwest. She did do better with some of the other characters. Still, I think I would have preferred a different reader.I hope my review doesn't deter Goodreaders from reading "Possession". Lots of people love this book, and certainly its treatment of the Victorian poets and of (nearly) contemporary scholars of Victorian literature is fascinating.
