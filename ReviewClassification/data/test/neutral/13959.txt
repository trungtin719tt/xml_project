You know how sometimes I choose to litter my reviews with innapropriate words or themes? Like Austin Powers taking a giant shit in myGuilty Pleasures review, or my reoccuring use of the word 'balls' in myShiver Review?Well, the theme and word for the day is buttsecks.As in:I was innocently reading One Foot in the Grave by Jeaniene Frost when the two main characters suddenly had buttsecks.Now, I'm a shameless, wanton hussy with super magical slut powers, just like any other girl, but some things just kind of throw me off. Like buttsecks.Buttsecks.Yes, I'm not spelling it right on purpose.Cat has been working in her secret organization for four years and hasn't seen Bones since she dumped him when she suddenly finds herself the target of a bounty and...Well, I don't care about the rest because there's buttsecks!Like the first book, One Foot in the Grave contains a lot of sex, action, supernatural dudes and only moderate-to-light buttsecks.Buttsecks.The storyline is quite good with a clever little ending which contains absolutely no buttsecks at all.The whole story is a bit of a blur. Tatiana tipped me off to the fact that there could possibly be buttsecks present. Interested, and ever increasingly perverted, I decided to see how the author would pull it off and what the author would describe it like. So basically, for me, this story started out with a beginning that was lacking in buttsecks, buttsecks, and the end of the story that was buttsecks-free.Now I'm wondering why the author decided to do this. Was it to be different? To recreate a norm? To show this as a normal part of couple's love lives that is often not spoken about?If it's the first then it almost certainly worked for me. I've already used buttsecks thirteen times in this review and I'm almost certainly going to use it more (buttsecks!)If she's creating a norm in fiction, or to show a little seen side of secks acts that aren't talked about in polite society, then I can't, as a reader, relate but I can appreciate her for her efforts.It was certainly different... I can't say that I found it a huge turn on to read about, but luckily Frost threw in several other moments to kind of even it all off.So, in closing... buttsecks.That's all I have to say, folks.Buttsecks.
