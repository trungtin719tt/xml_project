This is one of the two stand alone novels authored by Dan Brown; other being the Deception Point. Both are of the science fiction genre. But no matter on what genre Dan Brown writes, one thing you can be certain to find; and that is the use of codes and puzzles.With his unique use of codes and puzzles he creates a wonderful mystery, where the reader is taken on a suspenseful journey. I have always loved Dan's ability in keeping the reader on the edge and making him too run against the time to solve the puzzles and unveil the mystery.In addition to mystery and suspense there was a sweet love story too, which I think was a bonus. :)
