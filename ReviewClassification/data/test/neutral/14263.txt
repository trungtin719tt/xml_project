I gave this one 3 stars because I'm really convinced it's the weakest link in the series. That said, Southern Vampire Mysteries really is my favorite series of all times.Quinn is far from my favorite character in the series, he actually goes right in the basket with Tanya and Arlene. At first I couldn't figure out why, I tought I was just blinded by Eric and my never ending adoration for him, but no, Quinn is obnoxious all by himself.Apart from that, the book just ties some loose ends from the previous ones. Nothing new happens, and Eric is not around for the most part. I enjoyed learning a little more about Sophie Anne and Andre and I really enjoyed kicking Bill in the ass (thank you, Eric).
