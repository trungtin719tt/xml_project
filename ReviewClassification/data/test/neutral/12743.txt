A lovely, quotable book, similar to the writing of L.M. Montgomery.Which is also what bothers me about it.When I first read this, years and years ago, I was impressed by all the poetic imagery. And itisimpressive that she was so well versed in the language of sight and sound. But reading the book now? All those bells, and crickets, and clouded, blue skies...just make me sad. She wasn't meeting us halfway. She was meeting usallthe way.She touches on the problem, herself:At that time I eagerly absorbed everything I read without a thought of authorship, and even now I cannot be quite sure of the boundary line between my ideas and those I find in books. I suppose that is because so many of my impressions come to me through the medium of others' eyes and ears.But more than that, she had merged with her caretakers. The "story of [her] life" is essentially the story she'd been told: Helen, the burdensome invalid; Helen, the grateful student; Helen, under the bright, blue sky.This passage details her family's reaction upon hearing her speak for the first time:My eyes fill with tears now as I think of how my mother pressed me close to her, speechless and trembling with delight, taking in every syllable that I spoke, while little Mildred seized my free hand and kissed it and danced, and my father expressed his pride and affection in a big silence.The implications are heartbreaking. And, in fact, learning to utter a single phrase required hours on end of grueling repetition. Pleasing her family (often) seemed to be her only motivation.She could nevertrulyexpress what she, alone, knew for the simple reason that there was nolanguagefor what she knew. She had no culture of her own. And so, ultimately, she had no voice.[Miss Sullivan] put the crab in a trough near the well where I was confident he would be secure. But next morning I went to the trough, and lo, he had disappeared! Nobody knew where he had gone, or how he had escaped. My disappointment was bitter at the time; but little by little I came to realize it was not kind or wise to force the poor dumb creature out of his element, and after a while I felt happy at the thought that maybe he had returned to the sea.
