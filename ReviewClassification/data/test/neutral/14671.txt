I have to say I liked it, because it sucked me and I read the three books in little more than two weeks. And they are long books.But as some agents did say on Twitter some time ago, if this book was first published in the States, it would have been trimmed and it'd be better. The three of them are too long.On the other hand, Lisbeth Salander character is one of the best characters I've read lately. You become instantly attached to her and want her to succeed.In general, Larsson treats better women than men. Lots of women are great characters in the trilogy. Didn't root for male first character though. It lacked strengh or something.
