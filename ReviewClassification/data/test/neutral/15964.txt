This is my 3rd book from Nicholas Sparks, and just by the 3rd book I already know Sparks' writing formula. The beginning was sort of a drag since I already know what to expect from the way in which the author would set the tone of the story, introduce the characters as to who's the good, the bad, and the one we should watch out for, etc. What caught my attention was the latter half part of the book, and the twist at the end (The Sixth Sense much). In a nutshell, it's a light, familiar and feel good read. You pretty much know what to expect from Nicholas Sparks, and he never disappoints.
