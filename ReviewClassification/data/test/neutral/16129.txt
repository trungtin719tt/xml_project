You know him best as the father of "Fight Club," that fiendishly nihilistic modern tale of materialism and machismo run awry. "Survivor" is a different take on almost the same theme, a fractured look at contemporary living as seen through the twisted prism of a not-too-innocent.The narrator begins by telling us that he has hijacked a plane and that he will run out of fuel in so many hours. In that time, he will tell us (and the flight recorder) the tale of how he got to where he is. So then, in retrospect, the narrator relates of having grown up in a religious cult to be a perfect servant to the wealthy people of the outside world, learning everything there is to know about how many folds to place in a napkin and which dinner forks to set out and what products will remove which type of stain. Through bizarre circumstances, his home phone number is repeatedly mixed up with a suicide-prevention hotline. Finally, he gets fed up and tells one tortured man to do himself in.It is not long before the self-murdered man's sister begins circulating in his world. The narrator soon learns that she is a psychic and has a knack for predicting great disasters. Through plot twists each more fiendish than the last, soon the narrator winds up a pop celebrity, tapping into the woman's precognition powers to become a modern-day Nostradamus. The darker sides of capitalism and celebrity soon rear their ugly heads and a mysterious stranger is tracking him down, perhaps to kill him. To add even more tension, the page numbers count down rather than up, just as the narrator's fuel is running out.Like "Fight Club" (unread by me), "Survivor" turns on its ideas more so than its plotting. It is a fierce critique of the cult of celebrity, unfettered materialism, and the emptiness of modern living. It is as nihilistic as "Fight Club" in that no one is getting off easy; and there will be no happy endings.On that note, "Survivor" loses that potential fourth star for the frustrating ending. I demand neither happy nor sad endings, and ambiguous endings can be transcendent and subversive (remember "The Sopranos"?) but "Survivor" just...ends. No apologies from the author and no explanations. I wish he had written just two more pages but I suppose his point is not the story, but the style and the message.Still...
