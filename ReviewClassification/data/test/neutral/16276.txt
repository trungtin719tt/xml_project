Lucentio: Hey, I'm Lucentio. Who's that hot girl?Bianca: That would be me. And hotness is about all I have going for me. Because I only have about 5 lines.Lucentio: Wanna have sex get married?Baptista: I'm her father, you whippersnapper. Get in line. She can't get married until her older sister does.Lucentio: Who's that?Katherina: ROAR! GNASH! GNARL! I don't want to get married, but I live in Elizabethan England so I must. I also have a violent streak and beat up my sister all the time because she's a wuss.Lucentio: Damn. Guess I'll disguise myself then, because this is a Shakespeare comedy.Petruchio: WAASSSSSSUP???!?!?!?!!?Hortensio: Hey buddy!Petruchio: My dad's dead, yo. I need a rich woman. You know any?Hortensio: Well, there's this shrew I know. I'm trying to get with her sister. I figure the best way to get with her is through disguise, like that other guy.Petruchio: Enough about you. Where's the rich chick?Baptista: She's right here! KATHERINE!Katherina: WHAT?Baptista: Marry this guy!Katherina: NO!Baptista: YES!Katherina: FINE! I hate you! You just don't understand! And you like Bianca best!Petruchio: Shut up! Hey, guess what. We got married offstage, and I dressed up like a jackass.Katherina: This sucks.Petruchio: Okay, let's go home. PS you don't get to eat or sleep.Katherina: But I'm hungry and tired.Petruchio: Too bad.Katherina: AARHRGRGG!!!!!!!!!!!!!Lucentio: Remember me? I'm putting even more people in disguises! It's zany! Also, I totally married that chick in secret.Bianca: Huh?Lucentio: Shut up.Petruchio: Here we are! We came back for your wedding.Lucentio: Sweet! I see you tamed that shrew but good.Petruchio: For reals.Lucentio: But she still isn't as obedient as my wife.Petruchio: You wanna bet?Lucentio: You're on.Hortensio: Me too! I got married too!Lucentio: Whatever. Servant, call my wife.Servant: She won't come.Hortensio: Call my wife.Servant: She won't come.Petruchio: That's what she said! I mean, other servant, call my woman.Katherina: Yeah?Petruchio: Tell 'em about it.Katherina: Women suck.Petruchio: Kiss me, Kate!CURTAINOkay, here's the deal.The Taming of the Shrewis a well-written and genuinely funny play that glorifies spousal abuse. You have to forgive a lot because of when it was written and how it was written, with the framing device and all that jazz. But it still draws laughs from brainwashing your wife. Uncool. As a theater practitioner, you have to make some decisions. Do you cut most the abuse? Do you change the intention of the final speech? Do you keep the blatant misogyny? Whatever you do, you end up with something either very far from what Shakespeare wrote or something very far from what we (in theory) believe today.
