After InheritanceIt was quite disappointing actually. IT played out exactly how everyone thought.After all the emphasis on no eldunaris, it was kinda annoying when it was all they could find to save themselves! I was hopping for something like a super kickass spell or an awesome sword that could shoot lightning through shields or...never mind, but in short I was hopping for something dramatic. Everyone knew Eragon would kill galbie. Great surprise! Eragon went along with exactly as Angela's prophecy said. The green dragon's rider was no surprise either. The fight to defeat Galbie was Boring!(with capital B) IT was like paolini had run out of things to write, which I guess he had as this was an extra book in what was going to be a trilogy. I basically slapped my face every page. The only things that were a bit interesting were the ultimate true name, the 'All Race Alagaesian Olympics' and 'Urgal and Dwarf Riders' and the 'eggs'. Everything else...BORING. Though the parts about Nasuada's kidnapping were a bit interesting(the tortures and all) and I think she will make a good queen..maybe is Murtagh changed his mind, he would make a good king too but I guess we'll never know. As for Arya and Eragon...not even a kiss?? Ow, come on! BORING!Before Inheritance:oooooooooookay....now everybody is going crazy for the new book ,I'll admit i'm going crazy toofor the new bookNow as i'v read the other's pridiction too I don't totally agree with them.If eragon ends up with arya and roran becomes the new king ...then there will hardly be any fun left cus everyone is expecting that!!!!!so here are my prediction-Eragon stays bachlor......'cuz he dies a herioc death with saphira.elva becomea the new queen.....and kills galbatorix...somhowarya becomes the rider of shruiken...dude it was against his will to serve galbatorix!!!roran's son\daughter becomes the new rider of the last dragon..Well.....my pridictions are the most unlikely ....but it would be fun if it was that way!!!!!!
