I have read so many novels with concentration camps as setting so this classic and controversial book just did not really have much impact to me. In fact,thisday in the life of Ivan Denisovich is comparable to just another day in the life of K.D. Absolutely.You see, there are days when K.D. Absolutely is sick but he has to go to the office because he needs to work for his family. He is the breadwinner because his wife has already retired after 20 plus years of working trying to augment what income K.D. Absolutely makes to support the family. Not that K.D. Absolutely is complaining. In fact, he is grateful to his wife who had to help him in putting food on the table and paying the bills. Now that K.D. Absolutely is alone trying to earn money to support their daughter who is still in the university, he is also thinking of saving up for their retirement. That life when both of them are already retired seems like a big question mark in K.D. Absolutely's mind. How does he make sure that his savings are enough for him and his wife to have a comfortable twilight years? Given the high cost of hospitalization and medicines not to mention the daily life's necessities?The life ofIvan Denisovichin thegulaghas nothing to do with his retirement and he is still young. His concern is mostly about food. He leaves his plate sparklingly clean because he licks every surface if there is still some kind of flavor clinging on it. It does not matter if it is sausage or some kind of boiled grass, he either finishes them all of or he leaves some for the rainy day. He even knows how to get more food, e.g. befriending the office workerTsezarwho has some access to food. Ivan Denisovich is there in thegulagbecause he was suspected to be a German spy during WWII. Even if he is in fact, innocent, he still gets incarcerated and has been there to serve his sentence for ten years.I will not give the details of my life in the office because I might get the attention of my bosses especially because my book reviews (or rants really) get posted on Facebook and you just don't know who reads what in this time in cyberspace. However, my days nowadays are similar to that of Ivan Denisovich in terms of surviving the heavy workload: I am just swamped to the extent that I could not visit Goodreads and Facebook during workdays. Last year, I still could open my GR in the morning to type in a book review and click on the like button to the delight of some of my Facebook friends. Last year, I could finish one book a day because 8 hours of honest work in the office was enough. Last year, I could even read books during my one-hour lunch break at noontime. Now, all of those have to go. I just work and work because assignments keep on coming like crazy.And it just felt that life in the office for me is just like the modern version of Solzhenitsyn'sgulag.Even if I have money to buy food, oftentimes, I don't have the time to go out to buy even from the ground floor's bakery. The work is challenging (hello, boss!) but it is dizzying (from lack of sleep) and you always hope and pray "God please show me the light even just a flicker" as you work on the many assignments that you have to finish on time.
