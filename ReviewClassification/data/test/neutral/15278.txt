The three stars might make it look like I didn't like this book, but I actually thoroughly enjoyed it! The reasons I felt I couldn't give it a higher rating are 1) lack of originality and 2) Even though this is a fantastical book/story, the ending was a bit too fantastical and abrupt for my liking.Before reading a book, I always consider the author's intended audience and proceed from there. If the intended audience is the young reader, I don't expect any more, and I look for the authors integrity to that audience. So with that level established, the reasons I really enjoyed reading this book are 1) the details that McKinley takes you into Beauty's character, 2) the set-up of story line and characters, 3) that the main character was a hero. My definition of hero: someone who has great character, honor, integrity, and has the strength and courage to act upon what he/she knows to be right. In my opinion, the only part of Beauty's character in which she is lacking is her self-image. I think that McKinley intended her deprecative self-image to come across as charmingly humble, but the truth is that she's sending a disturbing message to her young readers. To loathe oneself has never been, nor ever will be, a pleasing attribute in the eyes of God. To be humble and not vain, is a pleasing attribute. While Beauty did not attain the latter, she also was not fully guilty of the former. But it remains that McKinley did miss the mark by just a tad. She just went a little too far with Beauty being horrified of anyone thinking she might not be ugly. I'm only criticizing because I wanted Beauty to be the perfect hero. It's okay that she knew she wasn't a beauty, but she just put way too much thought and effort into that idea. Then in the end, I found it disturbing that not until she realized she truly was beautiful did she find her self worth, and feel worthy to marry her prince.So, at first glance, it seems like an innocent enough fun-read. But the underlying messages that we all receive can do their damage, especially to the intended audience: young readers. I feel that as long as this can be pointed out and discussed, it's still a good, fun book to read, and therefore, should not be avoided.
