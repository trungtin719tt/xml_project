The best part of this book? Grace's dinner: Four pieces of pizza, two Hostess cupcakes, and four glasses of wine. Now, that's something I can relate to. Conjuring a Greek-god sex slave that finds the normal, slightly chubby Grace irresistible? Not so much.Considering how much this guy has been around....Anything Greek mythology related and I usually love it. There was a little bit of mythology, along with some Roman and Greek history. *But*, there was mostly a romance that included a lot of "heat swirling stomachs", "deep moans", and "hot looks". And, the main point of the story was for them to avoid having sex so that they could break his curse. So much longing...Aaannnd, he's been with thousands of women and is angsty while she is pretty much a virgin.soooo original!But, I thought this was a prequel to the Dark Hunter series, so that's why I read it. Apparently, I was wrong. I know!?! Me, wrong? I guess it could happen. So, on to the first Dark Hunter book. There is someone who has been trying to get me to read this series for years. Happy now, Jen?
