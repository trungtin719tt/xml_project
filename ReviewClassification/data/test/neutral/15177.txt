This one again culminates in a battlefield of a climax. I suppose Bill will no longer be part of the bizzarro love triangle, as Quinn the were-tiger (lame) debunks Bill. Eric is still a contender though...Anyway, this one seemed a bit smaller a story than the others... probably because it all takes place in a hotel. The vamp summit is, of course, very eventful and the story continues with alligences being switched left and right and new characters developing while others are mercilessly killed off. It is clear that Sookie's naivete counters her magical gift so that she represents... the Everywoman ? She is sometimes quite materialistic &amp; superficial... but saves the day, or night, all in good time.
