Mac makes me think of an ostrich who buries her moronic little head to the sand right after painting a target line in pink on her ass. She still is delusional, too stupid to live, yappy about clothing. But she changed a little bit. That's all I'm giving to her.Barrons is ... sigh... MINE!!!Story line got really interesting and there were twists I wouldn't expect from Mac. The author had little spasms oflittle did she knowmoments here and there but they were barely there, compared to the first book.Buddy read with my awesome ladies Jill and Sleepless.
