This was too long, way too long. I think part of this authors charm is that there is always some meandering between the important scenes, but in this book it felt like she was just going on and on about nothing, and I often found myself, thinking about other things instead of following these rantings. I still enjoyed the narration and the humour. I also feel that I understand Claire much better, we get to know her not only as Jamie's lover but also as a healer, a mother and a person. She has now become my favorite person in the series. Lastly I liked reading about life in the colonies.I hope the book six is more focused, otherwise I'll have to give up on this series.
