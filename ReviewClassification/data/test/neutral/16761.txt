Book Review3 of 5 stars toThe Tempest, a play written around 1610 byWilliam Shakespeare. Ever wonder where the word prosperous came from? Or did Shakespeare name the lead character in this play Prospero as a nod to the word prosperous? They are one in the same... sort of. Prospero's been cast off onto an island and wants to restore a life for his daughter. Thru trickery and imagination, he succeeds in a manner of speaking, and though it's a troubled path, he learns his lessons in the end. I really do like this play. I've seen it on stage and it was well-produced. It's one of his somewhat-more-famous plays, but it's not as well-liked in popularity, if that makes sense. As always, its highly creative, but to me, it's a bit of a compilation of all his other plays over the years. Written in the last 5 years of his life, it's one of his final pieces, which may explain why. The characters are vivid. The action is mostly clear. But I felt it lacked a driving force like the others. I didn't so much care whether he was successful until the end. I think because it is more ethereal and aesthetic than full of huge substance, I might have been in the middle. I only read this one once, so I'm due for another read.About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.
