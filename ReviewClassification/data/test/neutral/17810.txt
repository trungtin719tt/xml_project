There are two central recurring elements in Lovecraft's stories: the academic and the fear of miscegnation. The academic nature of his stories is what causes so many of them to bloat and become glacially slow reads, but at the same time it is essential to Lovecraft's idea of horror: an idea which does not fit into our mental world, which scares even when there is no immediate danger. In a way Lovecraft's stories can be seen even as an assault on academia, showing the limits of the pursuit of knowledge. This is theoretically a good idea for horror fiction -- the reader doesn't have a serial killer breathing down their neck, but they read the ideas just as well as the characters. The problem is that to a modern reader, or at least this modern reader, most of these ideas are less frightening and more just kind of cool.And then there's the miscegnation thing. Most people treat the racism in Lovecraft as incidental, a relic of the era (although this excuse is, as always, a little inadequate), but it's essential to several of his stories. ("The Dunwich Horror" and "The Shadow Over Innsmouth" both play heavily on this fear of racial mixing. Weirdly, these stories are the ones with the most conventional horror narrative.) The fear of the outsider is a key element to Lovecraft's stories.As for actual quality? Well, the problem with Lovecraft is that there are a lot of brilliant ideas inside overwritten stories with one-dimensional characters. This was the early 20th century, so there was no such thing as RPG sourcebooks or websites to post your awesome worldbuilding stuff in. Some stories are almost pure exposition -- the entire plot of "The Call of Cthulu", for instance, is a guy researching something and then getting scared. The world Lovecraft created is pretty freaking cool, and has been used as the basis for a board game and several tabletop RPGs, but it had an awkward way of getting out.There's no doubt that Lovecraft was a hugely influential horror author, possible the most influential, but I can't say that his stories are essential reading. Like a lot of early genre fiction, it's worth checking out if you want to see how the genre develloped, but it can be a bit of a slog to get through.
