Anentertaining, but slow movingnovel set in 1906 Georgia. Although you can't help but love Will Tweety (who narrates the book), Mr. Blakeslee his grandfather (a highly respected man in Cold Sassy) who runs off with Miss Love, a milliner at his store, after only three weeks a widower, I found the book kind of dragged along to the point that I found myself checking to see how many pages were left until the end ofmanyof the chapters.The last quarter of the book, however, moved along pretty quickly; unfortunately, that's when(view spoiler)[ Uncle Camp put a pistol in his mouth because he felt he "was a good for nuthin" (sad) and then Mr. Blakeslee gets into a fist fight with a robber at his store and ends up sick in bed with pneumonia and passes awaywhich was a shocker.Miss Love who ends up pregnant with Mr. B's baby, however, is finally accepted into the family, and Will apparently graduates from Ag College.(hide spoiler)]There are some pretty funny stories and tricks played by Will throughout the book, and I did enjoy his encounter with the train and his reminisces of Lightfoot.DID NOT LIKE THE MISTREATMENT OF CATS!&gt;
