Meh. I thought I would really like this, but I just didn't. The kid in the book isn't very likable - nor is he believable. He manages to do a bunch of top level magic just because he read it in a book - unlikely. He never listens to anyone's advice and goes around trying to beat the best magicians in the country with no plan. The ending was even more ridiculous....an entire room of the most powerful and experienced magicians in the world and only a 12 year old boy can save things. PUL-EEZE. /eyeroll
