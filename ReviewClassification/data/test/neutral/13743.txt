This book is a good one to read if you live with someone who has also read it. This way, any time there is a lull in the conversation you can talk about how depressing it is. Conversations between me and my roommate often go something like this:"You know what I was just thinking about? Ethan Frome.""GOD. That book is so depressing.""I know, right."The book is not only enjoyable, but also a great conversation piece. Do not read it if you cannot stand unhappy endings.
