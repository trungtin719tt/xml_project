First, let me begin by saying that there are books that aren't necessarily works of art, but they are entertaining. THE WAY OF SHADOWS by Brent Weeks is one of these books, and I think I know why.Lemme explain.When you first crack this bad boy open and begin reading you are immediately hit with the sense that you have stumbled upon something really, really epic. And then that feeling slowly starts to dissipate and I honestly think it has a lot to do with the sloppy character dialogue, or maybe it's the blatant and rampant misogyny, or it could be the 10 million POV's you have to keep track of. Seriously this shit's everywhere.Okay, now let's break it down.The dialogue is pretty awful. It is like night and day between the actual descriptive writing and the words spoken by the characters. Like, literally everyone talks like a 12-year-old boy no matter who they are or how old. The actual writing is really good, the plot and storyline are very interesting, and the characters are likable if not somewhat relatable (well, everyone but Elene. I can't stand her).The misogyny is pretty bad but I was able to overlook most of it. If you have serious issues with women being oversexualized then you will probably hate this book. That's not to say that there aren't some really bad-ass women, because there definitely is. There are also recurring themes of rape and abuse.And lastly, there are a lot of POVs. Every single chapter switches to a new character and it can feel overwhelming and like it's hard to keep track of what is happening. I am now on the third book in the series as I write this review and I am just now getting comfortable with the format of remembering what is going on with everyone at any given time.Overall, this series is a guilty pleasure for me. It IS entertaining, but I can see how it would rub a lot of people the wrong way. I am probably not doing a good job of selling this but I do believe that with a few minor changes this could have easily been a 5-star book.
