What would the world look like had the Axis powers won World War II? This is the question on which lays almost the entire foundation of alternative history, as this is probably its most common hypothetical - andThe Man in the High Castleis one of its more famous examples.InThe Man in the High Castlepresident Roosevelt is assassinated, which leads to him being succeeded by governments embracing traditional American isolationism - which not only keep the country largely out of World War 2, but also fails to lead it to recovery from the Great Depression and renders it unable to provide enough support for the Allies, in the end rendering it helpless to defend itself against the Axis forces which attacked it from both coasts, conquering and dividing it among themselves, establishing their respective puppet regimes in the former U.S. and a small buffer zone.In 1962, 13 years after the end of the War, the world is divided between the two great Axis powers - Imperial Japan and Nazi Germany (Italy barely enters the equation in Dick's novel), who enter a state of Cold War. German hegemony is established in most of Eurasia, where Slavic people are exterminated and the few allowed to live confined to reservations and in Africa - most of its inhabitants vanish in another holocaust. The Germans are shown to be much more ruthless than the Japanese, to whom they are also technologically superior - they possess both the hydrogen bomb and the capability to travel to and colonize other planets.In comparison to the ruthless Germans, the Japanese are presented as almost benign. Japanese occupied land is ruled with rigid bureaucracy, with a complex class and social system. Citizens of occupied America present little to no resistance to their new overlords, treating them with a mixture of resentment and emulation; they resent them for conquering them and making them their subjects, but at the same time they adapt their customs, behavior and even try to look like them to live in the new order. American culture is considered to have ended with the Axis conquest of the country; it's remains have either been incorporated into or replaced with Japanese culture. Conversely, some of the Japanese look for remains of genuine Americana, with pre-war cultural artifacts being sought by Japanese collectors.The question of authenticity is the main motor behind the book, and Dick's obvious interest which drove him to write it. What is authentic, and why? The whole novel is driven by this idea, sacrificing historical probability for ideological discussions (I find it impossible to believe that there would be no resistance movement in the post-war world, and that people would simply submit to the new order imposed on them). Dick namesThe Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germanyby William Shirer as being one of his major sources of information for the book; coincidentally, it is the very book which I have been reading for some time when I dipped into his novel. Dick presents a variation on imagined Post-War Nazi politics, obviously inspired by his reading of Shirer - perhaps my enjoyment of reading his vision was lessened because I was reading the very author who inspired him to do so at the same time, and did not find his vision to be either very original or interesting. Dick's portrayal of Germany and the Germans is obviously colored by Shirer's adherence to theSonderweg- a theory which portrays German development as inescapably leading to the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Third Reich as its natural conclusion - which makes his portrayal of Imperial Japan as largely mild (considering the circumstances) a curious one, considering the history of Japanese colonial rule in Korea and China. Why emphasize and even enhance one while at the same time greatly downplaying the other?Much has been made of the book's ending, which is open and has puzzled readers ever since the book was first published. Dick has not been happy with the ending, claiming that apparently the ancientI Ching(which he uses heavily in the novel) has failed to provide him with an answer on how to end the book; he was not able to end the book the way he wanted to - whatever it might have been - therefore, there is no real ending toThe Man in the High Castle. Read at your own risk - this is a book by which you might be rewarded, but also burned.
