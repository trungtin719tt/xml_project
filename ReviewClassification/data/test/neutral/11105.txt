I was going to give this 3 and a half stars because I found it to be a bit dull but when I actually think back at what happened in the book it wasn't that dull, it was just me not being connected to the storyI don't connect that well with Tally, I had hopes she'd grow up a bit more in this but she still stayed the same, this made me a bit annoyed as most the book was just tally.The storyline was great but all the fun exciting stuff really happens towards the end, I hated new pretty town and not having David or any of the other smokies featured more.I did love the new developments and am hoping the last book specials brings this series all together and me and Tally can finally get along
