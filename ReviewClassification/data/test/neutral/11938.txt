Guys!! Omg! I have finally finished TFC i can't believe it!! I am sooo happy! I've been reading this book for the past 14 months! Yes, you read correctly 14 months! This book was by far the weakest book in the series. It was so so so descriptive to the point where you would go like "are you for real"? "Is this possible?" "Hurry up for Gods sake"!! "Why do we need all this unnecessary crap!!" That Gathering lasted forever!! 100 pages in and we were still having breakfast geez!!..The first half of the book was so so so boring and tedious nothing but details about the war and the regulators and the militia omg!! I was crying out of frustration and even trying the audiobook didn't help. (even though Davina porter does an excellent job at narrating i highly recommend trying the audiobook it might work for you). There was no plot whatsoever and the pace was very slow it could still have really worked if it was 400 pages less. I really wanted to quit but my love for the characters and the series kept me going and i couldn't be any happier! The second half of the book was sooo good! The pace was a bit faster but still slow and the main focus was again our favorite characters which kept me reading and reading. Some events that happens in the second half of the book reminded me of the first book and i was like "yaasss we're finally back woohoo!" A big event that took place.. wow speechless!! Wasn't expecting it at all it was amazing! A bit shocked though at what happened to a certain character which was so interesting and frightening.. Diana likes to makes her characters suffer oh gosh! I give the first half of the book 2 stars but the second half 4 stars!! Overall my rating 3.5 stars.I am sooo happy because i didn't wanted to quit the series i love these characters so so much and now i will continue on reading A breath of snow and ashes woohoo! This is proof of how much one can love the series if you get passed TFC then nothing can stop you! I can't wait to see what happens from here on. I felt sooo emotional at the very end that proves love conquers all. So if you reading this book have faith don't give up keep reading it gets better and better. You won't regret it!
