I had high expectations with this novel. Actually the beginning part of this book was highly enjoyable and the events turned out pretty fast paced with unpredictable story line. But after second half, the story was really confusing .I was bemused by how it would start talking about one character then the next swipe of the book would start talking about something else. And the worst part of this book was the ending. The abrupt ending was highly disappointing . The Zombie Room has an intelligent premise, but it could have been better executed.
