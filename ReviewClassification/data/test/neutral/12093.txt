I'm always interested in reading books by my favorite authors' influences. Raymond Chandler played a major role in the molding of Stephen King's and Lawrence Block's work. You can see, line by line, where those two authors learned the ropes. King a little less so then Block, but it's there.Thing is, I didn't always find myself enjoying this book. As is the case with many heroes of my heroes, I tend to find the originator boring by comparison. Take H. P. Lovecraft for instance. His racist-ass paved the way for damn near every horror author who's ever had his sights on a Bram Stoker or World Fantasy Award. Every week there's a new Lovecraft-themed anthology. But dude's writing is plain and antiquated and boring. I'm sure he was the hottest shit since battery-operated back massagers in his day, but to read him now is like reading a car manual. No thanks. But, again, he was a major influence on several of my heroes.Chandler's nowhere near as bad as Lovecraft, but this book is dated as fuck. Some will call me a white knight for the next few words I write, but fuck 'em. I don't like males who strike women. I don't care if those women are doped or hysterical or whatever. Keep your damn hands to yourself. I'm not trying to impress anyone. I've been happily married for 16 years. Fuck I wanna make myself look good to you for? I just don't like it. Never have. That's me. But, of course, hitting women was all the rage in Chandler's day. Books like his make me think of those old painted adverts with the wife over her hubby's knee. He's got his hand raised and she's bawling. But he's gotta teach her a lesson because all women are emotionally-compromised children. That mindset never gelled with me. Because I'm attracted to women. Men who treat women like children and then fuck those same women... Man, I gotta say, there's something fucked in their heads. Last thing I'd want to do is fuck someone I also felt needed to be disciplined.But what do I know? This is why BDSM is a thing.In summation: Of course this book is dated. It was published in 1939. But it inspired some of my favorite writers and is still inspiring authors today so maybe it's worth a read, you know, in case you're one of the few who, like me, hadn't read Chandler. I'll likely continue on with the series solely on the grounds that these books are so short and easy to read. I just hope that, in the future, Marlowe keeps his grubby hands to himself.Final Judgment: A decent noir tale that inspired a generation or six.
