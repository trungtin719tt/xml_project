I realize this is a lukewarm review at best for a series of novels that has become an international bestseller, and inspired both Stockholm and Hollywood to adapt the story for the silver screen. I blame Stieg Larsson, who had the gall to pound out a hundred thousand pages about a brilliant maladjusted hacker and her difficult friend the brilliant risk-taking investigative journalist, and thendiebefore his editor could say, "Stieg, I get it, it's a vast technological conspiracy with child-molesting Russian mafia at the core. Now let's get rid of chapters 13 through 487, ja?"Bottom line : great page-turner, wonderful character development, but unfortunately a chip off the Dan Brown block when it comes to plot and, you know, writing. Bonus, though : after you turn the pages in a furious frenzy to find out whose email that kooky Lisbeth Salander will read next, you can use them as kindling. It's a cold winter. Thank you, Stieg.
