Honestly... Not mad at this book. Is it cheesy? Sure. But is it also kind of a good time? Yes. I would compare the caliber of writing to most adult urban fantasy series. I didn't expect much going in so I was surprised by how much I was into it. It reminded me a lot of Vampire Diaries, which I'm always down for. I might even read the next book in the series. Way to go picking out books, high school me.
