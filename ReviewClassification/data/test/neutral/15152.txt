This was a perfectly decent, well-crafted thriller, which I happened not to like very much, for reasons that have little to do with its craft or its quality. This sometimes happens, and it doesn't mean that others won't enjoy it. The plot is fast-moving and with some real surprises. The portrayal of alcoholism is great (although I would have liked it to go further into the more visceral details, rather than skimming the surface of the theme).However (and yes, I know it's trivial, but) the title. I'm getting tired of these vaguely infantilizing titles that refer to mature women as "girls" (although, to be honest, none of the female characters seemed at all mature to me). The multiple-person narration was nicely-handled, except that all three narrators sounded the same, to the extent of noticing the same things and recording them in the exact same register and vocabulary. And although I have no problem enjoying books with unsympathetic characters, I found the women in this book not only unsympathetic, but really rather dull, relying on the "damaged woman" trope for interest, rather than investing the characters with anything more tangible. The publishers are pushing this book as a second GONE GIRL. I was hoping for something new. Not this time, I'm afraid.
