Jar of Death Pick #15Dead As A Doornail is book 5 in the Southern Vampire series aka True Blood. As always the further into a series I get the more difficult I find it to review. If you've made to book 5 then you probably enjoy this series so I don't know what to add to that.In Dead As A Doornail Sookie Stackhouse is dealing with a lot of serious shit but somehow she seems to handle it really well. The title of the book is a "dead" giveaway to what Sookie's dealing with. Someone really wants her dead. As per usual in these books every man who Sookie meets wants to sleep with her(Sure) and she continues to juggle 3 men ( what a terrible problem to have).If you liked book 4 Dead to the World then you will like Dead as a Doornail also. Its a cute little series.
