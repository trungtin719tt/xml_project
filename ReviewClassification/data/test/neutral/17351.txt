I attach with the book the memory of meeting my Kuwaiti internet friend Aida for the first time in Duabi. We bought this book together, each a copy, but failed to read it at the same time. However, it is a fast paced book, read it in one setting during a 24-hour readathon, and quite liked it.What fell short for me was that though the topic is emotional, the book itself could not extract even a tear from my eyes (and I'm a book crier). Also, it was crammed with unnecessary advice and preaching by the end of it.However,I had low expectations, so I was pleasantly surprised.
