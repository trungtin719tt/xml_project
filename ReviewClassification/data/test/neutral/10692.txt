Overall, the Secret, aka, the Law of Atttraction has a great message: like attracts like. This is of course very true in most cases. However, implicit in the teachings of the Secret is the idea that our current place in life is not good enough, that we need to create something in the future that will in turn complete us (better job, more money, new relationship, etc), and make us feel whole.Herein lies the fallacy of the book. For in the words of Thich Nhat Hanh, "Peace exists in the present moment, if you cant find it here, you wont find it anywhere."There is nothing we can do that will "complete" us in the future. Why? Because we are already complete. So it's a fine and wonderful thing to have fun with the LOA, and create the life you want, just don't expect to be satisfied with whatever you create in the future if you are not satisfied Now.
