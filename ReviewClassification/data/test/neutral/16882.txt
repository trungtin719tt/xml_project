That was a shock. Definitely nowhere near as good as I expected it to be. I mean, maybe Just Listen heightened my expectations, but hey, this was not even comparable to her earlier books. *sigh* Where to begin... -Ruby gets absolutely no resolution, IMO. It's great that she and Cora get along, but what about the potential Dad search? And her mother's not any better. What happens to the yellow house? -The key. You don't do that. That's not how you tie loose ends up. She needed to have kept that key forever, that's just...no. Dumping the key is in no way symbolic nor is it realistic. -Nate is too perfect to be flawed. This isn't to say that you know, popular kids aren't abused or something. It's just...there would be hints all the way, and there weren't, not any decipherable ones. He doesn't act right, it's just not realistic! -Ruby knows better than to sit back and wait instead of getting up and helping. -Parts of the book were highly predictable in a bad way. I mean, Just Listen, you knew it was going to be Annabel and Owen, but when it happened, you were still super over the stars excited. Here...stuff happened. Reggie and Harriet, Cora being pregnant, Nate and Ruby, and it's all just...oh yeah. knew that was going to happen. oh well. -LOVED the tie-ins. Yay, Annabel and Owen cameos &lt;3 (is Rogerson the same Rogerson?) It just...didn't function well. Plotlines didn't mesh, things didn't get resolved well or realistically...it was just...blah. (And you KNOW how much I hate to say that, because I absolutely LOVE Sarah. *sigh*)
