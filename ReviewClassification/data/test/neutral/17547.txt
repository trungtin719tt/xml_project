Well.What can I really say? The House of Night was the first vampire book series I had read and while it has a good plot, I feel like the books have spiraled down to disappointment since Untamed released. None of these recent books have had the feel to them that Chosen and Betrayed had. Stark is a total Gary Stu and Zoey is nothing more than a Mary Sue who has to be defined by a man (or some guy by her side) for her to feel 'powerful'. I thought that High Priestesses were all about feminine power but if they need a man by their side then there's nothing powerful about it.I strongly dislike the fact that the authors seem to be catering to the fans of Zoey/Stark since their relationship makes no sense whatsoever. They met in Untamed and they're soulmates in Hunted? Seriously, WTF?! Love at first sight books are full of EPIC LAMENESS.I will read Awakened just to see if anything will change but my hope for this series is gone.(As a sidenote: Rephaim and Stevie Rae's relationship is creepy as hell. Why would anyone say they think Rephaim is hot when he killed an innocent woman, has a beak, and looks like a big bird with human legs? Really? Is that the new teenage wet dream? If so, then that's gross)Addendum: Oh my goodness. I was pissed beyond belief before reaching page 100. Please prepare for a much longer review! One with very angry thoughts. I will probably abuse the capslock too but OH WELL. This book deserves it. I am LIVID right now.EDIT: Now for my review.This book pissed me off in the worst possible ways. I couldn't believe some of the things that went on.The first thing that pissed me off was Zoey in the beginning. She chooses to stay on the Island of Skye so she doesn't have to deal with the troubles in Tulsa or the path that Nyx has given her. I wanted to slap Zoey because she chooses to avoid her responsibilities just so she could have sex with her boyfriend Stark every night. Oh, and she just came back from the Otherworld after saying goodbye to Heath who died because of her. So she said goodbye to one boyfriend and is now fucking the other. Go Zoey. You're not a whore. Not at all. *Eyeroll*Back in Tulsa is where something horrible happened that brought me to the edge of tears (but I never cry at books - I just get seriously pissed): Jack dies. Yeah, Jack. The cute blonde kid, possibly the sweetest character ever in this series. He is killed by Neferet as her sacrifice to the debt she owed him. I was pissed beyond belief. This all happened within the first 100 pages of the book, too. What really sucks is that Damien, Jack's boyfriend, witnessed it too. It sucks on so many levels. First, Damien and Jack were lucky to find each other and then they're seperated by a murder done by an evil bitch who needs to seriously go DIAF.Why do authors feel the need to kill of their sweetest characters? Do they think it's a good idea? I have to say a big HELL NO to that. My respect for authors are gone when they pull stunts like that. Cassandra Clare did it to Max in her TMI books and now PC &amp; Kristin have done it to poor Jack. His death was UNNECESSARY. It broke my heart into a million tiny pieces.The characters that annoyed me most in this book: Stevie Rae, Aphrodite, Kramisha, Neferet, Zoey, Stark, and Dragon. I wanted to shake all of them and asked why they were being such dumb asses. Maybe hating on Kramisha is a little too out there but the dumb bitch was making fun of him before he died. She may not have been doing it to his face but it still pissed me off that she was talking about him like that and referring to him as 'gayboy'. Bitch, please. You need to get Hooked on Phonics.However, the other characters do deserve major hate. I don't know what was up with Stevie Rae but she was bipolar to almost everyone and I don't even know why she's a High Priestess. She's not a very good one. Aphrodite was a bitch to everyone and she doesn't deserve the respect she gets from fans. I like her to a certain extent but after a while her bitchy ways start to piss people off.Zoey is off dilly-dallying on some island with a guy she barely knows ignoring everyone back home just so she can take a 'break'. OK, yeah you've faced some hard times but you have things to do and vacationing on some island with your *boyfriend* (who you've only known for a few week jsyk) is not the right thing to do. I can't believe it took a death to make her come back. People die because of Zoey and instead of trying to stop it, she runs away.Erik Night gained back the respect he lost from me in the past two books. Jack's death seriously hurt him and even Zoey herself said that he'd been arrogant and possesive but there was still something good inside him and maybe if she hadn't treated him so horribly, he would've been different. I still stand firm on the belief that if he hadn't had two shitty ex-girlfriends, he wouldn't have been a jerk to Zoey. Just saying I understand where this guy is coming from.Too many people have died in these books. I know that killing off characters have become popular for authors to write but it wasn't necessary for this book. Nolan, Loren, Anastasia, Heath Luck, Jack, and now Zoey's mother Linda have all been killed off and for what? What does it serve? Nolan and Loren's death in the beginning of the series (when the books were really good) were used to start a war between vampyres and humans. Anastasia was killed by Rephaim. Heath was killed by Kalona because Kalona is also an evil douchebag who needs to seriously get off his high horse and get his act together. But Jack and Linda's death were seriously two of the most unecessary plot points ever written.
