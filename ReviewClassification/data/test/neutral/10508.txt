I have mixed feelings about the whole thing. On one hand, I didn't like the practice of Hamilton retelling only the myths that she enjoyed, rather than using the most wildly accepted version of the stories or combining the different stories into one retelling. I also didn't understand the point of the Norse mythology at the end, after more than ninety percent of the book was dedicated to Greek and Roman mythology - it was a little jarring, and very unnecessary. But on the other hand, the book was well-written, well-organized, and informative. This is an excellent book for reference purposes. But I wouldn't recommend reading it like a novel.And for the love of all that is holy, please don't assign students to read it that way.
