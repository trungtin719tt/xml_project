This book is an excellent chronicle of the events leading up to WWII, using fictional characters to personalize the telling of the story. While the accuracy and detail of the history is amazing, my problem was with the characters, and (what I saw as) the lack of anything particularly exciting or even interesting in what was happening in their lives.It's a long book, and I kept waiting for some intrigue, some duplicity, some action to liven up the story, but it never occurred. All the lead-up to Pearl Harbor and the onset of America's active participation in the war was well told, but then, with respect to the characters - nothing.Maybe it was just me.
