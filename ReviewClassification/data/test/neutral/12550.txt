I read this to Nick because I read it myself as a first grader. (Yes, I was a precocious reader.) Since I haven't even glanced at it in the quarter century of intervening years, it was interesting to come back to it.In some ways I was disappointed as an adult reader. The formal, quasi-Elizabethan language the animals use to talk to each other struck me as pretentious, which I don't believe was at all my original reaction. There was that almost total lack of female characters that is almost inevitable in books meant for boys, which ticks me off every time. Kipling's imperialism and unconscious racism were also sadly clear to me. By racism, I hasten to add, I do not mean hatred. I mean an unthinking assumption that white people, specifically the English, are inherently better than brown people, specifically Indians, in certain ways. (The imperialism clearly arises from the same source.) In fact I think Kipling loved India, including the people who lived there. He just thought they weren't quite his equal. These things bothered me, but at the same time I don't want to be too hard on him. The man was writing over a hundred years ago, after all. He was a product of his time, and really, I think his attitudes were better than most of his contemporaries.In spite of all this, there were many things to admire about these stories. They are undeniably exciting, with a fully realized, exotic setting. Riki-Tiki-Tavi was just as good as I remembered it. The Mowgli stories were more melancholy and violent than I remembered, but that's not entirely a bad thing. It didn't bother Nick any, certainly, and it meant I enjoyed them more than I might have otherwise.Nick's opinion may matter the most. And he loved it. Maybe not as much as Harry Potter, but he was totally into the book. The parts that bothered me didn't impinge on his mind at all. All he heard was a series of cool stories about tough little boys and brave, noble animals.
