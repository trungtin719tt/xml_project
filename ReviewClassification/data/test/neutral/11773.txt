If you aren't already enamored with Murakami's writing, I recommend not reading 1Q84 - unless what you want is a treasure hunt for some simple Japanese recipes. 1Q84 is actually a test to see how much Murakami fans are willing to put up with. And the test is a tough one.The first part of the book is nothing short of what you expect from Murakami. But towards the middle it really begins to sag with tedious, mundane descriptions.One reviewercalled it memory-insultingly repetitive and that's not entirely wrong. (To be fair the repetitiveness is due to combining all the three books in a single volume in the English edition. But if they published it as one book, that's how people are going to read it.) Then there are numerous badly written sex scenes. So far, in his other books, I have been giving him a pass for those. But this time I couldn't help being annoyed. You know how when a new characters enters the scene, some authors would describe his/her countenance. Likewise, every time Murakami introduces a female character in 1Q84, he describes her breasts. What's up with that?!And yet I have slapped four stars up there. Clearly the man can do no wrong by me. I don't usually keep track of what books are going to be released soon. This is the only book I have ever pre-ordered. This is the only hardcover I own, because I did not want to wait till the paperback was out. I even carried this monster of a book on a flight because I did not want to put it on a hiatus while I was out of town.There is almost 1000 pages - that's plenty of room for the good and the bad. Tedious portions notwithstanding, what Murakami does best is still somewhere in there. And I am willing to forgive the rest.The world with the two moons is absolutely fascinating and full of intrigue. Despite the complicated plot and multiple threads, he writes with superb clarity and never leaves the reader lost and confused. The last part of the book has us following three intersecting story lines. Ushikawa, Aomame and Tengo are all looking at the same picture, but at different angles. Each one of them is trying to fill in the pieces outside their respective field of vision. And it all comes together very elegantly in the end.And that brings me to David Mitchell. Last year I hadswooned all overCloud Atlas. Since reading 1Q84, I find myself agreeing more and more with the reviews that call it pretentious, gimmicky and what not. Because compared to the way Murakami handles multiple stories, Mitchell does seem to be trying too hard. In any case, I did enjoyCloud Atlaswhen I had read it and nothing is going to change that now. So no hard feelings, DM.
