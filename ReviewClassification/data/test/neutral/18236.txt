To be honest I was disappointed a little, because I regret to say that I had high hopes from this book after reading two of Nicholas Sparks' novels before. Nonetheless, the book was enjoyable. The book talks about Denise and her son Kyle who moved to Edeton and meet Taylor, a volunteer firefighter who will be required to dig into his painful past due to unforeseeable circumstances. Eventually they fall in love and become a happy family.I liked the suspense that happened in the beginning of the book where the entire town of Edeton along with the police department and fire department embarked on a mission to find the little four year old, Kyle lost in the woods during a heavy-cold storm. In addition, I think he did a great job in showing a mother's unconditional love for her child, in both cases with Denise and her son Kyle and with Judy and her son Taylor. Also, the author had a good range of vocabulary but not too much which made the reading easy-flowing which I found to be impressive. Moreover, I like the fact that the author has done his homework regarding the possible illnesses that Kyle may have had, the experiences of a firefighter's days at work and more. Nicholas has done a good job in describing Taylor's character. I felt the pain and guilt he's been carrying with him for years which made him resistant to serious commitments.Overall, this book was different for me because it showed me how a person is not always immune to change and it showed me the long way a person goes through to break through the barriers and move forward in life with the power of love. Love for Kyle, his mother Judy, the love for his friends Mitch and Melissa, and finally the love for his one and only, Denise.
