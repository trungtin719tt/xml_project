I've enjoyedNicholas Sparksbooks in the past (even in the recent months) but this wasn't much. You could predict so much before hand and there wasn't so much of a mystery left. I found out half the mystery by the middle of the book but perhaps I would've liked it better if I hadn't read similar books. Though it wasn't so bad as to be rated 1 or 2 stars, it also wasn't so good as to be 4 or 5 stars.I believe it could have been much better in a number of ways though.I won't recommend it but if you want, go for it. It's not a bad one but just not so great for me :)
