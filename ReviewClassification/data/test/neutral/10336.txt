Dear God...there was *so* much plot in this book. Like, there was a lot going on and I'm not entirely sure all of it was necessary.Oddly enough I enjoyed the first half a lot more than the second half which seems to be the direct opposite of most peoples opinions of this book.Well, on to the next one.
