I went in to this hearing that this was the best Koontz book ever. Of his books I have read, I would not say that this was my favorite (maybe not even in the top 5) - but it was still pretty good.The following may get me "booed" by some, but I am not really a dog person and Koontz often has a golden retriever as a main character. I think that fact may have tainted my feelings about this book a bit. I don't mind having a pet or an animal as a main character in a book, but here it felt like a bit much to me.However, it still was an entertaining read with interesting characters and some good thrills and chills.
