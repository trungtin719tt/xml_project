So I was really surprised that the book was nothing like the movie. I love that Forrest Gump movie, watch it about 2 times a year. I really had to get used to it being something totally different and when I got used to it, I started liking the book. However the space shuttle thing and later on the cannibals.. it was really over the top. The book never seemed to stop after that. All I can say is that I am glad I have read it, but that is that.
