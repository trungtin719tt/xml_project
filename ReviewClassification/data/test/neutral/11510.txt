I'm happy to report that this book was much better than the previous one - scandals occurred! murders! pregnancies! a new time traveler! a revolution! and barely any lactation scenes! Still, in a book that's nearly 1,450 pages, there was just too much detail. I could have lived without knowing every one of Claire's medical treatments or several dozen descriptions of people's hair, but hey, that's just me.
