3.5 starsHuh. So this was a lot more fluffy than I was expecting.Like everything else I've broken down and read lately, this was one I'd been avoiding for a long time. I kept hearing the wordrapewhen someone mentioned this, and it sort of put me off.I figuredEasywould be all tear-jerking &amp; angsty, and that's not something I actively seek out in my reading material.And then I read the blurb.When her attacker turns stalker, Jacqueline has a choice: crumple in defeat or learn to fight back. Lucas remains protective, but he's hiding secrets of his own.So, I'm thinking that maybe Lucas played a part in her getting attacked or something!Ewwww! Nooooo!I don't wanna read a romance withTHISdude as the love interest!I'm mentioning this, because if you're weird like me, then I want to put your mind at ease. Lucas' secret isn't that he's sneaking into her laundry basket to sniff her panties, or hiring guys to attack her so he can play hero. Sure, hisdark pasthaunts their relationship at some point, but it's nothinghedid. Which means, he's not a creeper, he's just a bitdamaged.Anyhoo, if you're fond of the fixer-uper (read: Tragic Hero), then you will most likely loooove Lucas, because usually my crusty heart isn't swayed by these types of guys, and evenI(grudgingly) found him somewhat adorable.So. Yeah.Short, sweet, and it tackles some dark subject matter without getting too heavy.It also made me realize that I need to make sure my girls have taken a good self defense class before they head off to college, and I need have a few more talks with my boys about stepping in and putting a stop to any hinky behavior from other guys.And if you're looking for something to show your boys, I really like this one:Tea and ConsentIt's a (can't believe I'm saying this) fun way to talk about sex &amp; consent with tween and teen boys.
