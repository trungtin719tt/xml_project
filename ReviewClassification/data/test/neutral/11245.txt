I am still looking for well-written thrillers, and I think I have found one. Robert undoubtedly possesses writing skills that elevate him above the pack, and for the most part he delivers an enjoyable, at times even immersive, experience.In the opening chapters, Robert demonstrates that he is able to guide the reader's perception of the characters masterfully. In the first chapter, the protagonist of the novel is being nursed to life by a local doctor. Gradually, the main character is shown to regain consciousness, and we learn that he has lost his memory. We take part in his struggle to explore his world, and I found the experience of reading the chapter strangely unreal, just as it might be when you actuallydosuffer from amnesia.It is hard to prove but I think Robert may have created this atmosphere deliberately. We experience the protagonist's struggle through his eyes (3rd person point of view) and take his part in conversations with the doctor. In these conversations, Robert fails to establish any framework, we do not hear a lot about the location in which the characters find themselves, or about the circumstances that got the protagonist into the doctor's care in the first place. We heara little bit, but nota lot. And because we do not have a tangible framework which would aid our orientation, we find ourselves in the same position as the protagonist. We hang on the physician's every word, we try to figure out what happened, we are struggling to get a grip. But as nothing is said in context, everything remains unreal.Indeed, the protagonist does not even have a name. He is being referred to throughout as "the man", "the patient", or "the man with no memory". Robert gradually lifts this anonimity in the second chapter, in which the designations gradually give way to the more personal "he", and finally, in chapter three, to "Bourne", the name Robert uses during the majority of the novel.So this was the good stuff. I think Robert has clearly shown in these opening chapters that he commands writing skills that set him apart from most other thriller writers. After these skillfully crafted opening chapters, the writing remains fluent, but becomes more mainstream. Dialogue sequences with his girlfriend, to be introduced at a later stage, are meant to show the harrowing pain he goes through in recovering his memory, but are repetitive and become quickly tedious. Still, overall, an enjoyable read.Just to pick out one thing, though, I think Robert likes playing with language and find turns of phrases that are uncommon, that would set his style apart from the pack. Sometimes this works, but sometimes he comes up with things that just sound odd. Let me share some of these with you, and see whether you agree:... scraps of relevantly irrelevant information. Gossip. (p224)... she gave them in turn to the slender salesgirl, who walked cadaverously out of the office... (p233)Congressman Efrem Walters ... was not to be dismissed with facile circulocution that dealt with the esoterica of clandestine manipulations. (p251)Now, that last one I have no ideawhathe is on about. But this next one is an excellent example of an evocative metaphor, and represents what I think Robert wished to achieve:His bearing was umistakably military, imposing his body on the surrounding space, entering it by breaking it, invisible walls collapsing as he moved. (p367)And finally, can I have a moan, please. It's the usual thing I always get hung up about. Thrillers must work. If a writer chooses to give details about topography, town maps, or language, then these detailsmustbe right.When Robert's characters speak German, they speak the sort of invented language that an American author may think is idiomatic, but unfortunately only exists in his imagination. For some reason, Robert is particularly inept when it comes to German - his French is much better, although it suffers from the same general malaise - no pun.When Robert's characters move around, they frequently die an undignified death by driving their cars into oncoming traffic or a lake. Or at least that is what theywoulddo if they took the twists and turns identified in detail in the plot. You cannot turn left into the rue de Rivoli from where the characters were standing on page 292; you'd end up stuck in the Altstadt in Zurich if you tried to drive the routes they "drove", and you cannot kill somebody on the General-Guisan-Quai without attracting so much public attention that you might as well deliver yourself to jail immediately.Well. Robert wrote the novel 30 years ago, and I do not know what Zurich or Paris looked like at the time. But German and French haven't changed completely during that time... But maybe I am just a git and should shut up. Which I will now do. As I said, I think Robert is a gifted writer and he delivered a good novel.
