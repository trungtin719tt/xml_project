I got this free e-book from Simon &amp; Schuster--apparently to tie in with Twilight's popularity, they are re-releasing this Night World series that was originally published around 1997 (I had read L.J. Smith's Vampire Diaries series back in the day, but not this series). You could tell where car models had been updated as well as computer technology and the usage of "cellular telephones"), but the plot was exciting enough.One thing that completely fascinated me about this book: the music. Was the genre Ethnotechno, or was that just a band name? Here are some descriptions: "madcore stomping music from England," "a Dutch club song" (which is "fine for doing the Netherlands skippy dance to"), "a velvety Portuguese lament," "plaintive Bantu wailings," and "the strange rhythms of Burundi drumming." Whaaaat?I may just have to download some of this, just to comprehend what madness is lurking here.
