I have a complicated relationship with this book. On the one hand, the premise is SUPER GREAT. He bodyswaps every single day, but I really could've used even more bodyswapping. UGH BODYSWAPPING, I WANT TO ROLL AROUND IN IT. And I read the whole book in a day, which, like, I barely even finish books anymore, so that's impressive, and there is definitely huge talent in writing something where the reader wants to know what happens next. The storyline with Nathan was greaaaaaat (except for the letdown at the end of A not wanting to know more about Poole -- UGH, SPEC FICTION HEROES, PLEASE ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW MORE) and several of the bodyswapping minidramas were super compelling (the depressed girl, the siblings toward the beginning) and frankly, I wish the whole book had been like that.However. The romance is the blandest bland thing in all Blandtopia, and unfortunately it's pretty much the A plot here. The only reason I could see that A loves Rhiannon so much is that she seems to him like a vulnerable waif who needs to be rescued from her allegedly horrible boyfriend. (A is the biggest Nice Guy TM you've ever read, it's gross.) Speaking of which, A is allegedly raceless and genderless, but I am using the male pronoun because he comes across suuuuuuper like a white dude, because it's pretty rare for any other demographic to be as condescending as he often is. (Haha is that mean? It's true, anyway.) Which, also, he talks about being attracted to a PERSON not a GENDER in that annoying way that smug bisexuals sometimes do when they believe that their uncontrollable sexual preference is more open-minded and so morally superior to other people's uncontrollable sexual preferences. Ugh.I think the unexamined privilege of the author is what damages the book the most for me. He's trying to write a book about what it would be like to exist without the external things that define all of us (race, gender, sexuality, family, etc) but he's a white dude and he writes like a white dude. I mean, how could you not? But I don't think he really understands what it's like to have people NOT automatically take your opinions as more important than other people's. And I think it comes across as though the default state of being human -- what's normal, what everyone would be like if they didn't have a body -- is like a white man. Which our culture assumes all the time, so it's not weird he would unconsciously think that, but it makes for a much less interesting book.Anyway. On the plus side, gay and trans people exist and are treated respectfully. (He gets suuuuuuper preachy about gay rights, though. Nothing he says is wrong, except the tone of wanting a cookie for having, like, a bare minimum of human decency.) On the minus side, the chapter where he bodyswaps into a fat person is the most horrifyingly offensive thing I've ever read.So, um, it's a mixed bag, is what I'm saying.
