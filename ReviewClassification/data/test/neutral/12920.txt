This was a great little memoir to read! With only 130 pages, it doesn't take too long to read. In fact, you can read it in chapters over a long period of time and you'll have no problems following along.Most of all, I enjoyed the ideas and inspiration in this book by being more authentic with yourself and your life. To be okay with disappointment along with joy. To be more aware of your aloneness, thoughts while you are alone and being okay with those thoughts.I loved how she wrote about living in the moment and allowing yourself to go with the flow of life and responsibilities. You can gain something from this book depending on the subject matter and what you're looking for.Great read!
