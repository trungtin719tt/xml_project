I'm a Sparks fan so I wanted to love "A Bend in the Road" from the get-go and although I really enjoyed the first half, the second half felt that much more hollow because of the richness of the first half. IMHO, here are my random thoughts: Brian's character needed to be more fleshed out....I found myself feeling somewhere between loathsome and pity for him and not because we got to know him as a real person, but strictly because of his actions explained from Missy's death forward. As this was the "big twist" of the book (which I figured out half way through anyhow), I really desired to know more about what drove Brian to react to the accident the way he did. Running off at the scene was completely believable, but stalking the family for a year while hiding in trees, carrying binoculars, watching Miles' son Jonah play at school, and then saying nothing for two years? A bit creepy to me? He obviously needed some serious therapy and there wasn't the slightest nod to this, just fast forward a decade and he's happily married, saving lives in the ER, and just like that he's healthy, healed, and hopeful for the future? A bit hard for me to buy into without more explanation of his journey toward healing, departing from his stalking days, and what the hell was he like before he accidentally killed Missy (saying he was shy and introverted fell short, way short)? So aside from that, I adored Sarah and Jonah and even Sarah's annoying mother. Miles was easy to fall in love with until his rage took over a long three years after his wife's death and meeting the second love of his life - again difficult for me to buy into after seeing his actions begin to reflect a sense of letting go and moving on for himself and his son in the first half of the book. He too obviously needed some serious therapy (obsessing over Missy's supposed "killer" as an almost nightly ritual) and not once did he apologize to Sarah for jumping the gun (no pun intended) accusing her of deceit after all of the tender moments and self-truths they shared. I wanted to smack him upside the head....lol. The brief ending of Sarah seeing Miles return to her, thank God, helped to uplift my waning enthusiasm somewhat in end. But even then, I wanted to see some sort of final dialogue between these two main characters to show that Miles was able to come to the realization that as he lost his wife (Missy), Sarah too, in a way lost someone irrevocably, her brother's innocence coupled with a forever tarnished future for both her brother and herself, knowing that Miles' loss was caused by someone she deeply loved.
