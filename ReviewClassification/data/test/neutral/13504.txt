[2.75]So, I still don't think this series is mind blowing and whatnot. I like it well enough though.I like how it expanded on the world, even though I didn't necessarily appreciate it. I mean, to be frank, I didn't give two shits about the world. I just wanted me some damn romance and Adam and Warner and Juliette love triangle, plus all the drama that is just so extra. Me likey that a lot more.I'd probably like reading about the plot and the world a lot more once I reread it and I stop gagging for the romance.I like Warner as a character for sure. I don't have the same hatred for him as I did when I finished book one. I just am not convinced of them two as a couple yet, though there scenes together were hot as fuck.And that ending.. about time Juliette accepted herself for who she is! She had better be a fuckin badass in Ignite Me and Warner and Juliette can become this sick power couple...Adam, I still love you though. Always and forever. (One Tree Hill-in my baby!)KENJI NEEDS HIS OWN SERIES!
