This book really lagged in the middle and temporarily took all of my high hopes with it. It did actually pick up towards the end and the end does leave you wanting to jump into the sequel. The problem was that Wouk was prone to lectures... Lengthy monologues about history. I do love reading about history but I prefer to do that in non-fiction rather than being lectured in fiction. The reason that it picked up at the end was because the monologues ceased and the action picked up. The characters are good and overall I do like the story. I just didn't love it.As for the audio - I listened to this guy onThe Caine Mutinyand didn't have any issues. This time I struggled, though, over a few things. Maybe because this is a much longer audio? The weird thing was that he needs to take a breath in odd places and it actually changes the meaning of the sentence or your understanding of who is talking. It's very strange. He's also excellent with accents but not with voices, which created some additional confusion over who was talking at times.
