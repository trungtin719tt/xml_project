Written as a "Christian science fiction" or a Christian fantasy, this involved a behind the scenes war between angels and demons, taking place invisibly while Earthly struggles are taking place contiguously.Obviously there is going to be a certain audience for this kind of fiction, but it was well written and entertaining.
