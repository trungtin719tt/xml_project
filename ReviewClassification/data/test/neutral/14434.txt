Now truth be told, the general thematics, as well as the writing, the stylistics of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe'sDie Leiden des jungen Wertherare evocative and tragically beautiful, a novel of intensity of feeling, of all encompassing anguish, the tragedy of unrequited, or perhaps more to the point, impossible, unasked for love (and for the 18th century, almost palpably modern, presenting both psychological and neurological allusions and musings that are well beyond its historic time, and often truly 20th century in feel and scope). And the main protagonist, young Werther, is shown by Goethe and through Goethe's exquisite, nuanced word building as absolutely and utterly how he is, as well as how he is generally perceived by society (including his nearest and dearest), with both the likeable and the unlikable, problematic traits of Werther's personality, his inner and outer selves (his psyches) portrayed with equal emotion, with equal sensitivity.But all that being said, and even thoughDie Leiden des jungen Wertherabsolutely shines with brilliance and is well deserving of being labeled a classic of German literature, I personally simply DO NOT LIKE Goethe's Werther as a character, as a person. He is obsessive, self involved to the extreme, with a sense of entitlement that uncomfortably reminds of narcissistic stalker type personages (for as much as some readers might indeed adore Werther or at least Goethe's literary achievement that is Werther, he basically continually seeks Lotte's company, stalking her, trying to foist his love on her, even when it becomes abundantly clear without a doubt that Lotte is not only engaged, but actually happily so). And although one might perhaps attempt to consider it somewhat of a blessing disguise that when Werther finally once and for all does realise that he cannot ever have Lotte for himself, for his lover, he "only" commits suicide and does not engage in what we would now label as murder/suicide, his final act of self destruction is nevertheless especially traumatic and massively devastating to and for Lotte, who is for a while also rumoured to be close to self harm, so saddened is she by, so responsible does she feel for Werther's suicide.The beauty and haunting qualities ofDie Leiden des jungen Wertherthus simply cannot mask the fact that as an individual, that as a person, the main protagonist is perhaps depressed, but ultimately and first and foremost a self entitled, eternally whining and clamouring egomaniac who somehow thinks that the world, that society (even whilst claiming to despise it), that Lotte herself somehow should revolve around him and for his benefit, his desires (and when Werther realises that this is not the case, he reacts not only petulantly and immaturely, but with deadly self harm, not only removing himself from society, from the world, but also and quite deliberately, in my opinion, hurting those nearest and dearest to him with and by his final act).Now I truly do think that if Goethe (if the author) had not made his Werther commit suicide, while I might still have felt somewhat impatient with Werther as a character (mostly because throughout the course of the novel, he does tediously declaim and continue to declaim poetry like a lovestruck schoolboy, which repetition have the tendency to become more and more monotonous asDie Leiden des jungen Wertherprogresses), I also very likely would have felt much more empathy and even sympathy for Werther, for his unrequited, impossible passion for Lotte. However, with the ending, with Werther's suicide and the sadness this causes especially for and to Lotte, most of my sympathy is for her (and while I might to a point understand Werther's sadness and despair at the fact that Lotte is engaged to someone else, is in love with someone else, I cannot in any way support or condone his actions, his violence, even if it was violence mostly towards himself, at least physically speaking). Still recommended as a classic of German literature, a beautifully and evocatively conceptualised, devastating psychological portrait of depression and egomania, although with the caveat that some if not many readers might well react as I have with regard to Werther, finding him immature, selfishly demanding and frustrating to the extreme (and I do apologise to those readers who absolutely loveDie Leiden des jungen Wertherand see in Goethe's portrait of him the epitome of misunderstood youth, but I for one, have never had much if any patience with Werther).
