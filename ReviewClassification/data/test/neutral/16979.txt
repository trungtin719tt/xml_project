I don't know why once in a year i crave for John Grisham may be because i started reading The Firm as first book, but couldn't complete due to some lame excuses or reasons. So, i picked The Client,The Client will kick-start after 10 pages, you can predict the plot in 20 pages unless you don't read what is written on the back of book. By 30 pages you will find it very difficult to put down.It is tale of a 11 year old boy Mark Sway who met a mob lawyer who was about to commit suicide. But before he commits suicide, he divulges information on where the body of the murdered Senator was hidden by his mob boss. Fearing reprisal by the mob or the FBI for lying, he hires a lawyer Reggie Love to get him out of this mess.I have strong empathy for Reggie Love, i quite liked her character. It is typical John G style, first build the suspense, raise the adrenaline, then drag a bit, then dramatized it, then let the reader guess, then add some twist, then add more twists then reach the climax sometimes predictable sometimes highly unpredictable, add bit of humor here and there. So, all in all it has everything a reader expects from John Grisham.If you are into thrillers or court rooms please give it try,I just wished there was some more of courtroom hearing part, rest everything was fine.I will sign-off with3.5/5
