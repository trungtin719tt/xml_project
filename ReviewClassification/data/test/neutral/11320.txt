Zoey Redbird is back in her full Mary-Sue glory. She's beautiful, she's unique, she's almighty and powerful; she's basically a giant pain in the ass and annoying as hell.Despite that, the series is beginning to unfold in a most interesting way as the stakes get higher. Apocalyptic prophecies and ancient vampire councils make for satisfying twists and turns. And the occasional switch to third-person gives fresh new perspectives and a welcome break from our beloved Zo.Stevie Rae's story specifically hooked me in. Her link with Rephaim was dark and intense and muddled the line between good and evil beautifully. Even Zoey and her harem of men were tolerable. Sure Erik's character was ruined, but Heath was just as puppy dog-ish as ever and Stark managed to keep his cockiness despite the case of Zoey-worship. Kalona of course remained hot in all his twisted possible-evilness.Add the fact that the ending is easily the most powerful one so far, and the inevitable conclusion is that I will be purchasing book number seven.Aw, hell.
