What's up with the juvenile sex talk, man? Ugh it's a great story, pretty funny and exciting and all, but he just has to throw in descriptions of genitals and sex acts wherever he can. I'm certainly no prude, but that doesn't mean that I need to know about every erection and scenario where the main characters have more sex in five minutes of reading than most people have all month! And I'm sorry, but there is no way to make a clever metaphor for boners or boobs or whatever. It's a waste of good writing skills. You end up sounding like a pervy 14 year old no matter what.But it did inspire me to cook some beets, and I'm seriously in love now. With beets. Weird, I know, but they're great. Since this is a book forum, I won't go on about it, but ask me sometime and I'll tell you all about how awesome beets are.
