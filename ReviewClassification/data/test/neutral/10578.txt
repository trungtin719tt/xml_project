I remember liking L.M. Montgomery'sAnne of Avonleaimmensely when I first read it as a young teenager, and during my recent rereads, I have still managed to enjoy most of the story (most of the featured episodes) almost as much as I did then, especially the anecdotes about the Avonlea Village Improvement Society (AVIS). But even more than the AVIS interludes, I have been rather pleasantly surprised at how much I have loved reading about both Paul Irving and Lavendar Lewis (two characters to whom I did not really feel all that drawn when I first readAnne of AvonleaHowever, I did and do find myself having rather major problems universally liking the character of Davy Keith. And indeed, it is not Davy's rather mischievous nature that I find problematic, but the fact that he is so often deliberately cruel and nasty to his twin sister Dora. Not only that, but I have also and with flustered sadness noticed that Dora is more often than not ignored and denigrated by almost everyone, from Anne to even Mrs. Lynde, simply because she is a quiet, unobtrusive child (and "must" therefore by extension also be boring and monotonous). And when one recalls what Anne's own childhood was like, and how she was both emotionally and spiritually neglected before she came to Green Gables, it is supremely ironic and annoying that Anne now seemingly approaches Dora in a similar manner, often ignoring her because Davy's exploits are more interesting, or more to the point, are perceived as being more interesting.Furthermore, I also tend to believe that there is actually a rather uncritical acceptance by L. M. Montgomery herself, as Anne's (and others') often rather negative assumptions of and towards Dora are never really actively criticised (yes, Anne realises that she might have a bit of an unfair and careless attitude towards Dora, but even though she is aware of this, she does not really ever strive to rein in her at times quite overt favouritism of Davy, and actually even attempts to justify it to herself and others). And as someone who also was rather quiet and unobtrusive as a child and teenager, this has quite bothered me during my recent rereads and continues to more than somewhat chafe (strangely enough though, when I was a teenager, when I first readAnne of Avonlea, this fact did not seem to bother me all that much, although at that time, I often did feel rather ignored and under-appreciated by both my family and the world).Now I would still most strongly recommend this novel, as well as the entireAnne of Green Gablesseries. It is just thatAnne of Avonlea, while certainly magical, does indeed and in my opinion have its potential issues (at least it did and does for me), with specifically the often overt favouritism of Davy Keith over his sister, over Dora, being majorly potentially problematic, a favouritism actually made considerably worse by the fact that it also so often seems universally accepted, even justified (and thus, from theAnne of Green Gables series,Anne of Avonleawhile definitely enjoyable, does also not rank amongst my personal favourites).
