This is a book I've read a couple times in the past and realized I never actually wrote a review for it. If I'm remembering correctly, this is the Quinn book. He's a pretty hot weretiger. Of course, he's not as hot as Eric Northman, but I did like him more than book Alcide.I remember enjoying this one, but not enough Eric. I do like the Queen. She is an interesting character in this world. I don't remember too many specifics from this honestly, so this is just a generic review. I am not sure if I will re-read these later ones again because it just reminds me of how bad the series ended. After the next couple, they aren't even worth reading anymore, in my view.
