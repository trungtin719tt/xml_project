Reading this book feels like how the beginning of summer feels, with all of the traditions to relive and new experiences to come. Most of the book is seen through the eyes of a 12 year old boy, so it also brings on many feelings of nostalgia, and the glorious freedom of being a kid in the summertime. That being said, I feel like something was missing in order for me to love this book, but as a quick summer read with a few insightful bits, this was pretty decent. Not my favorite Bradbury, but definitely still worth reading!
