I did not enjoy this book quite as much as the others in the series. I don't like the path that Sookie and Bill's relationship has taken, I don't think she should be so angry. I like Quinn some but even he does not seem to be the guy for Sookie and I hate the habit he has of calling her 'Babe'. The storyline was okay although it just barely touched upon some unanswered questions from previous books. It did leave us with some interesting new people for future books. I still look forward to more in this series.
