Maybe it's the fact that Delirium blow me away and therefore I had high standards for Pandemonium. Or maybe it is the fact that Pandemonium felt like a book from an entire different series. Lena is not the Lena from Delirium. To be honest, there was always that other self inside the first Lena, the one that said grey if you can recall, but this Lena felt like a stranger. More like a warrior-resistance fighter, trained assassine kind of girl than the student whose biggest revolution was to sneack out of the house to go to a party. Maybe it was that factor that turned the book into a hunger games kind of book and it felt wierd to me to read it. Other than that I liked the fact that the chapters were divided into then - now themes because it was nice to know what made Lena change and also what happened to her all at the same time without geting too boring and tiring. I also liked the story, especially the now one and loved the new characters!! The writing was nice, but now I know that L.O. can do better. Other than that I really enjoyed it!!
