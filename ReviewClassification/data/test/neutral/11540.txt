About a boy who loses both parents &amp; must then become a parent to his own sibling...Sure, many elements must converge to make a wee autobiography one outstanding read. Here's the jist: Eggers is an almost-household name writer who abuses his witty (ha-ha-ha) title and confounds the reader with an (incredibly dragged-out) insistence upon his own life story. Bookmarked by the dual tragedy of losing parents to cancer (within weeks of one another) are a bunch of vanilla events making up the bulk of the narrative: the guy knows just how vanilla it all is, and by using the tragedy as a platform to exalt HIMSELF (!) he can comfortably become the new superliterary Tyra Banks. Obviously by starting with the incident and by ending with it, the tugging at the heartstrings is seen as mechanical, a (if not THE) gimmick.It IS heartbreaking, though. Almost enough to (just like with my experience with 'Animal's People") put it down for good, if not for the attempt to make this into an even MORE personal account, promising much, even having revised editions put out, with new additions, clarifications notes, etc. Oh, Eggers: We truly care about you (why else read 400+ pages of your life?)!!! Post-modernism is promised throughout, as if this novel device will leave the reader awe-struck, as if the work shall surely be "staggering"! The only development here is the author's promises of a "straightforward" first half and a whimsical, self-absorbed postmodern second half. It's all a LIE (!!!)There is so much anger in this that it negatively affects the plot itself (how he is completely obsessed by his blond haired-blue eyed sibling, how he thinks bad things will happen any time, how he wants to fight the status quo he has no real problems with...). Once one discovers that at an editor's request to paint a "deeply hilarious" portrait of tragedy (I will bow down only to this: the Writer's Balls... his deep courage to prostitute away such an intimate detail in order to sell books [a method which, by the way, actually worked!]), to make it wacky and somewhat self-aware (only in that dreary, lazy way of the Postmodern work labeling itself as such), all the magic, all realism (which, in all truth, is what's incredibly HEARTBREAKING) is gone.
