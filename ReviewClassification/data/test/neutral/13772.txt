Win(slow) Berry, is a dreamer never satisfied with life, as it is. Always wanting to climb over the hill, to see what's on the other side. It will always be better, over there! An unhappy childhood with only one parent, to raise him, a physical fitness fanatic, rather cold but a good man...The single father Bob (Coach Bob), his wife having died, giving birth to Win. The dedicated football coach at the prep school, in Dairy, New Hampshire, called unimaginatively, the Dairy School. A second rate institution, for boys thrown out of superior ones, or not even able to get in them in the first place. Without the school, the small town would cease to exist. Win has no brothers or sisters, a lonely boy, very intelligent but nevertheless an unfortunate one. His life really begins in 1939, at a resort hotel, The Arbuthnot-by-the-Sea, in Maine, there he falls in love with Mary Bates, also from Dairy, they had kept away, from each other. She attended Thompson Female Seminary, Win, ( the name he prefers) of course the Dairy School, both are employees, at the hotel, during the summer. There they meet Freud, just his nickname, folks... not the famous psychoanalyst. An animal trainer, who has a bear act, performing nightly, outside the Arbuthnot, while the guests, are having dinner... a little unsettling . State O' Maine, the 400 lbs. bear loves the motorcycle. He sits in the sidecar, as Freud drives, scaring people , just the timid... even doing a dance. The young couple, get engaged and become great friends with Freud, who had encouraged the union, both are 19. Win goes to Harvard, but first he buys the bear and the motorcycle, from "Freud", he unwisely, returns to his native Austria. The animal act, with State O' Maine, Win calls the old bear Earl, is rather shall we say, not the best. Taking two long years before he has enough money, to get back to Harvard. Children arrive very quickly, Frank, Franny, John (the narrator of our story), Lilly and Egg... don't ask. Bang, bang, bang, etc., as Franny would say, many times afterwards, the eccentric family, is complete. Later, the father tells them stories, that maybe are not quite true, but still fun to hear, better than the mother's, she doesn't lie. After serving safely, in World War Two, at an Air Base, in Italy. Win not really an accurate name for him, returns home, graduates from Harvard, gets a job, where else, but the Dairy School, teaching English. And soon buys the closed Thompson Female Seminary, the Dairy School, finally letting girls in. The dreamer starts The Hotel New Hampshire , few customers though in the crummy hotel, it will not be the last one, he tries to run. The novel has incest, rape, terrorists, midgets, whores, and tragedies... And comic situations, a girl in a bear suit , how cool, after all this is really a comedy, believe it or not ? If you enjoy novels that are different , maybe over the top from the norm, The Hotel New Hampshire will be for you.
