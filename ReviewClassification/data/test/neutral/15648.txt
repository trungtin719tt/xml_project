So far my favorite from the series. Fortunately this book was way better than the others. Especially the first 60% were great. The end wasn't that good, but I really liked most of the book.In this Lucinda is trying to understand everything that's going on and isn't sure in Daniel's love. First of all I have to say that I loved the time travel. Not that it was perfect, bu time travel is one of my all time favorite tropes.The thing that surprised me the most, was that in this book I actually liked Daniel. I still don't love him and I never will, but at least I started to understand why he was acting the way he was acting. He did have some reasons and honestly his past is horrible. In this book Lucinda is tying to figure out, if Daniel really loves her. That is something that I've been wondering for a wile and I was happy to read about it. I know that in the end she is convinced that he truly loves her, but I'm not. I'm sure that he loves her, but more the idea of her and her past self. In the present they don't know each other that well.
