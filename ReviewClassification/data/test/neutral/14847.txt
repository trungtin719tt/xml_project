I have to be honest, I really wanted to like this book. The best intentions...Part of the problem may have been Kesey himself. It's a strong storyline, the irascible Stamper family that will abide by the rules of no other man. They're a richly drawn cast, full of flaws, secrets, and mistrust, but their unbreakable self determinism defines them. It's a strong start, but he confounds it by overwriting the minutia, underwriting the big events, and chasing a questionable narrative machination to the brink. By the end, I couldn't help but feel that he had undermined himself by virtue of his own writing. Oddly enough, I wasn't terribly confused by the character-jumping narrative, for me the trudge came at the hands of the drawn out descriptions, the constant, seemingly trifling ruminations, and the inexplicably soap operatic family skeletons, so easy to predict yet delivered with such severe, assured confidence. Kesey makes damn sure the reader is taking things seriously, whether they need to or not. Somewhere in this book is a great American novel, but it somehow falls just short. Sometime there was a great notion, a notion that succumbed to the torrential floodwaters of the very book it spawned.In retrospect, attempting a review of this book may be pointless. It's a huge, sweeping novel, but I could never get beyond feeling that the story itself was much smaller than the book it came in, like a giant box with a small present inside. I've always been one for economy in literature, both in words and interpretation, but Kesey's prose comes in torrents and leaves little doubt as to his intention. A shame, with characters this good it would be rewarding to follow them when their lives aren't so metaphorically predestined.
