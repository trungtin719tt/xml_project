Good story, but filled with fantasy cliches. Feist wrote this back in the early 80's so he should know better - Tolkien, Norton, Moorcock and others tread this ground before.Admittedly though, it is a hell of a pageturner even though the characters are badly drawn and the narrative is wacky as it speeds through years of development in a single paragraph. The love and romance is painful to read, skip over them.Considering that Feist stumbled upon a unique and admirable new fantasy conceit in these novels, I am amazed that he couldn't truly extract better characterization and narrative from the two worlds of the Tsurani and Midkemia. A shame, really. I do wish I read this series a few years ago, I would appreciate them much more and rate them higher.
