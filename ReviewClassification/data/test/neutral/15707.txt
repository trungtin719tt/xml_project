Around the World in Eighty Days was first published by Jules Verne in 1873, and was introduced to an adoring public as monthly installments.Each chapter is thus seen as connected but with its own hooks and cliffhangers. The character of Phileas Fogg has become a stoic archetype for too cool operators in books to come in several genres.This is fast moving and fun, still a good read over a hundred years later. One very interesting aspect of the narrative was the portrait of the American west in the 1870s from a European perspective.
