Perhaps Tiny Cooper is the more appropriate title because this book is really about two boys who have the same name (Will Grayson) and their connection to Tiny Cooper. Having said this, I admit that I really enjoyed reading this book. It is hard to comprehend how a book can become a musical but this book made that possible.
