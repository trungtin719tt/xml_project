I read this book right after I read Twilight because I was on a romance kick (very rare, I promise) and I couldn't get my hands onNew Moon. At first I was worried it was going to be lame because it makes it seem like it's going to be another story about what a jerk the main guy is and how he's neglecting his wife. However, I really liked the way the author made Wilson not a bad guy, but a good guy who just doesn't know any better. I usually don't like mushy books because it always seems like it's way overdone, but this book was really sweet.The one aspect I didn't really like was the author ties the book to his previous one (which I love) The Notebook. I guess you could argue that it plays a big part in this story, but I really don't think so. I kinda think the author tied the two together to get people to buy this second book. However, I think it stands fine on it's own.Warning:: If you cry easily in books, this could get you to tear up. Plus, if you are one of those girls who always hopes your husband were a hopeless romantic, but honestly, he never has been so chances are he never will be, don't read this book. Well, I take that back. Read it if you can look at it as sort of a guide on things YOU can do yourself FOR your husband. It made me want to be a lot nicer to JD.
