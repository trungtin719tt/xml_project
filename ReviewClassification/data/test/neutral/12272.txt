This was an interesting concoction. The beginning was intriguing, I was convinced I was going to love this book, not only because of its Frenchness but also because one of its protagonists was a precocious twelve-year old called Paloma. Paloma is the daughter of a French Minister and lives with her parents and annoying older sister in a very rich apartment complex. Paloma has a huge disdain for everyone around her. She finds everyone irritating, fake, stupid and/or ignorant. She's given to philosophising. A lot! I usually enjoy philosophy and philosophising, but many times it was too much and apropos to nothing. So I started getting irritated.The other main protagonist is Renee Michel, the concierge of this building. She's an average looking woman, but she's not average in her knowledge and appreciation of literature (I loved that she was obsessed with Tolstoy), film, music and art in general. But she keeps all that hidden from everyone else, as to not appear to "give herself airs". One must stay within one's social constraints and social class.I really enjoyed the art, literature and music references.But le piece de resistance for me was the special relationship between Madame Michel, the concierge, and one of the apartment owners.The ending took me by surprise, which is great, although I wasn't that keen on it.The Elegance of the Hedgehogwas a mixed bag of some excellent passages, some interesting characters, too much philosophy and an unexpected ending.3.5 starsI've received this book via NetGalley, in exchange for an honest review. Many thanks to Gallic Book for the opportunity to read and review this novel.
