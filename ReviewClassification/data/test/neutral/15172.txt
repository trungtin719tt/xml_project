This book was a letdown after the run of Sookie books which I thoroughly enjoyed. The bridal shower which even Sookie didn't enjoy was a big letdown.It was fun to see Barry Bellboy again when he showed up at the Summit with the Dallas contingent. But the vampiric political shenanigans went on too long for me although many readers probably enjoyed this part. The various vampire royalty gushing about how glad they were to see someone and thinking how they wished somebody would come along and stake the person became too tedious to do more than skim.Once mayhem and murder broke out, it was an exciting read right up until the end. The last third of the book was a great read.
