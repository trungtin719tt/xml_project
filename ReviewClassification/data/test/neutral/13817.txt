What a negative book!I truly disliked the Special Tally, because not only was she an asshole but because I really liked her in the previous books. I know it wasn't her fault she got turned Special but still...The plot was full of intrigue and action, but the parts that disappointed me most were when Tally was a bitch to all her old friends, not to mention what she did to Zane... I found it even more annoying when she(view spoiler)[on more than one occasion, refused the cure to being Special-minded in other words the cure that would enable her to think like herself again.(hide spoiler)]. The ending was... I dunno, it was weird I mean Tally does change sides and all but that speech she made about the Wilds was supposed to be powerful wasn't it?Even though I didn't quite understand Tally's final speech I liked these lines, "You see freedom has a way of destroying things". That's right in many ways today. When I really think about it, her words remind me of all the imperfections of human nature starting with greed. I thought of how Diego was (in the story) expanding into the Wild.Because the people of Diego weren't controlled by lesions they became more like us "Rusties" in a way, greedy and not really thinking of the bigger picture like the animals of the Wild. So I think Tally(view spoiler)[is saying she's going to protect the wilds at any cost and make sure the people of her world don't go down the same path as us Rusties(hide spoiler)]. Which leaves me wondering, is it possible to have a society that has equality and pain free happiness AS WELL as freedom of speech? Or is altering everyone's brains the only way to have a peaceful and un-destructive lifestyle? Oh gosh, I went on a little rant there! That's just what I THINK her final speech was all about...
