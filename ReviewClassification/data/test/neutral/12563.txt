In a really roundabout way, Kipling is responsible for you crying at Bambi (I didn't cry, I was just confused. The subtlety of the gunshot of camera didn't register. I spent the rest of the movie thinking Bambi's dad had gained sole custody. I was kind of stupid kid sometimes.) The Jungle Book is one of the early popular cases where an author so thoroughly anthropomorphosized animals.It's really a smug assumption that fits well with the British imperial mindset of the book. In a position of safety and power it's easy to act like animals are just people that speak a language we're unable to translate.Animals are animals. If they think they can take you, they'll kill you, sometimes for safety, sometimes for food. Otherwise they will run. We domesticate animals because humans find such behavior annoying.Trying to empathize with things that can not actually communicate gets people killed and eaten every year.For all his research, there's an odd sort of cluelessness to Rudyard Kipling's writing. The tales are chocked full of fun facts about animals and their habitats, but he doesn't seem to be aware that he was partially able to experience sites like India because he was a member of a massive Victorian empire. He's too busy imagining what animals would sound like in different casts and royal orders.Yes, these animals often talk like they work at a ren fest. Along with his dorky poems it's a fun reminder that as long as there's been writing, there's probably been nerds.Fortunately his poetic tendencies inform the prose, which flows smoothly, making the bulk of the stories a pleasant read. It's easy to visualize most scenes, and the writing paints a clear picture.Mr. Kipling had more of an impact on my childhood than I realized. Ricky Ticky Tavi and The White Seal were both adapted by Chuck Jones, and I watched those two cartoons obsessively as a child. Reading the source of those stories was slightly surreal, details lining up with images baked into my brain years ago. The secret seal island only accessible from beneath still sounds pretty awesome.Structurally the layout is rather wonky. It starts with the Mowgli stories, which are told out of sequential order, and then drifts off into a few short subjects.Kipling's style, while amusing, just doesn't emotionally engage. The one major advantage of the Disney adaptation of the Jungle Book was the addition of humor. The source material is fairly reserved, no nonsense stuff.I read the first book on my iPhone Stanza reader using a public domain copy. At this point , unless you're hellbent on having a paperback copy, you don't need to pay for almost any text more than a 100 years old. I listed the Amazon Kindle edition because it's the only one similar. I don't actually feel compelled to read the Second Jungle Book anytime soon, I've had my fill of his outlook on the wild.
