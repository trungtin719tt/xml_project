Another great story from Jane Austen; this time about the three sisters, Elinor, Marianne and Margaret, and their mother who settle themselves in a small and charming cottage in England. "Sense &amp; Sensibility" is mainly about the two elder sisters, Elinor and Marianne, and their journey of falling in love and finding a husband.I liked the sisters a lot and I enjoyed reading about their experiences in the world of love. They go through ups and downs, and Jane Austen constantly create surprises that make sure the plot is refreshened. However, while reading this book I couldn't abandon the feeling that it was all in all about some whining girls and their struggles. Elinor and Marianne are definitely endearing, but I felt like the plot was a tiny bit too simple and the descriptions a little bit too heavy for my taste.That being said, I still very much enjoyed this novel - especially the first 2/3 of it. The last 1/3 is when things became a bit too convenient, and that's why I ended up with a 3-star-rating.
