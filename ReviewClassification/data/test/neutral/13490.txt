2,5 starsReflected In You, the 2nd book in Sylvia Day's Crossfire Series was a pretty tiring read.Let me just say .....'The drama that continued throughout the story between Gideon and Eva just boggled the mind.....yes, no, yes, no.........At times I found it hard to believe that Gideon Cross could actually be the successful and hard billionaire as he's suppose to be....really, some of his behavior is beyond childish and immature!!!! And I am suppose to believe that all the women he has slept with are all obsessed with him!!!!! Okay, he's rich, he's gorgeous, he's out in bed....is that the reason??????Long winded, drawn out....that's what it was 3/4 of the way.............Only the last 1/4 at the end made any sense.The sex scenes - geez....talk about plenty......But, in a way, I felt that Gideon and Eva used sex in lieu of trying to communicate with each other. I am not so sure if these two are meant to be with each other!!!!!And whilst I liked some of the secondary characters in Bared to You, I began to dislike quite a few of them here...Cary, Eva's best friend and roommate....he was a total ass most of the time.Predictable twists, OTT situations..............hell, this was a pretty unsatisfactory read.
