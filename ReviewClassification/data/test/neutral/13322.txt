This book was-*wait a moment*Let me bang my head until the author proves that there is one more book to be published for us readers, or if this book was just a really, really good joke.Omigosh. Donottell me that this is the last book of this trilogy. Donottell me that the author just didn't answer all the questions we were waiting for. And please donot freakingtell me that this is what we readers are getting after being such a fan of both The Maze Runner and Scorch Trials books.After happily reading The Scorch Trails and then excitedly waiting for this book for about 6 months, I yet again screamed with happiness (as I also did with another bookBloodlines) when I got to read it.The story started with a good potential, it was interesting, I was feeling it. I was reading it non-stop and then suddenly in the middle of no where I am like, "WTH is going on?"FAIL 1: CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS, CHARACTERS!I do believe Thomas here just had this emotion for everything."He was my close friend"From deaths to betrayals to everything, he just considered every living human being as a friend. Come on! He could act like he loved people or atleast cared about someone just more than friends. And don't even get me started on Teresa. To be totally honest, Teresa is just like a random stranger on the road I see everyday. I am either proud or totally miserable to say that I don't know her at all. She came and she went and I was just like, "Pfft. Whatever."And then Brenda. Weren't you just a side ass character introduced in the second book? Then honey, why? WHY are you the main heroine here?The only character I liked?Minho, Jorge and Newt.Minho for being the best of the best, Jorge for always being there and Newt for never giving up. The story till Newt was awesome.FAIL 2: Y U GIVE SO MANY DEATHS?Now readers who didn't read this book might find this fail spoiler-ish.First of all. Death of Newt. I think it was the most sensible one. I felt for that guy and I am so happy to say that James Dashner did a really good job in his ending. In simple words, I loved it.But, then comes Teresa. What.the.hell? She was the main heroine! How in the world can you kill the main heroine and replace her with a side kick? I do NOT approve this.And then 300 people killed out of 500? Ouch. That was a bit unfair. Atleast the author could have saved 300-50 something people.I miss Chuck. =[FAIL 3: WHERE ARE MY FREAKING ANSWERS?How could this book even end without satisfying the readers?(1)I wanted Thomas to his memory back so we could learn exactly what he and Teresa did before the Trials and why were they specifically chosen. Hell, I even wanted Minho's and Newt's memories back and Brenda's past.(2) How in the world did they end up in a green paradise with a hundred or so immunes so they can start over? Umm, hello? What about the rest of the freaking world?(3) Who is this Paige Chancellor? Why didn't she go to paradise with them?I love James Dashner's writing, I liked the book, don't get me wrong but I am really amazed at people who gave this book 5/5 stars. I am very sad to say this but yes, overall, this book didn't satisfy me and I am disappointed. Especially after being the last book of such an amazing series. But then, I will still miss the characters and this story will stay with me forever and always. 3/5 stars.
