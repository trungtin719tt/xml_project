This was my first book bySherrilyn Kenyon. I've read (and liked) some of the books she wrote under the nameKinley MacGregor, but I didn't know if I could use them as a reference because authors who change their pen names usually do it to establish different writing styles. Anyway, this couldn't be "bad" because, WTH, it's still the same person writing the books, right?Well... I liked this book but didn't love it. I had some laughs - which weren't always from laughingwiththe story, but from laughingatsome of its "silliness" - and one heartbreaking moment when Julian told Grace about his past and all the events that caused him to be cursed. Julian was a wonderful hero, a true "fantasy lover" - sorry, I couldn't resist saying it :) -, but his "perfectness" annoyed me. All those allegedly mature women drooling all over him and acting like horny teenagers... Please!*rolls eyeballs*Even Grace didn't act like a 29-year-old woman sometimes. And don't get me started on her being a "born-again virgin" who worked as a sex therapist, LOL.Anyway, it wasn't all bad and I even had some "awww" moments, like when Julian "restored" Grace's personal library. But those moments were too far in between and there was little else truly engaging to keep me hooked to this book.If this book is a good sample of what I should expect from theDark-Hunterseries, I can't see what the fuss is all about and I'm not jumping to get the next books. We shall see...
