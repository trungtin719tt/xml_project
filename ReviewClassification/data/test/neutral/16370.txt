I have spent so much of my year reading books that have been published in 2017, that there is something exceedingly special about diving into a book that was published in 1861. It was hard for me to consider that this was the same George Eliot that wrote The Mill on the Floss which I count among my favorite reads. Not that this was in any way a terrible story, but I believe I may be coming down from the 5 star high I had earlier today. A simple enough tale about a miserly weaver that is wrongly accused of a crime, shutting himself away from all those around him and the little girl that brings him back to the living. An appropriate read during the holiday season.
