A friend of mine who works for a magazine in New York told me they asked Bret Easton Ellis if he wanted to write for this magazine, and if so, what would he like to do? "DVD Reviews." No hesitation on his part.I read a short remembrance of Tom Cruise in the late 80's by Bret a while back in Rolling Stone - it was really good. He writes well for magazines. The high and salient points come quickly and clearly. The man does not fiddle-faddle.I recognized that same tabloid style in Lunar Park, which is a suburban gothic horror story. The author is playing himself here, and he is beset variously by alcoholism, drugs, a murder in the next county, his own literary history, his tranquilized and sullen adopted son, an equally sullen dog, the ghost of his father, and a monstrous and changing house.It's hard to say, many months after I've read this, how it all resolves or fits together, but I can tell you that the book reads quickly, is frequently funny, grotesque, horrifying, and never deep, and it will definitely not make you feel good about yourself. Or the author.
