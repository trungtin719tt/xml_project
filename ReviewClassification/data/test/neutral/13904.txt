A charming and sometimes tedious novel, Rincewind grew on me quickly and I enjoyed watching him get into and out of scrapes along the way. Death's and Fate's frustration with him was hilarious. I kept imagining them as toddlers stomping their feet :-D.Two Flower I was so so on... sometimes he charmed me and others... eh. His optimism seemed misplaced sometimes, but he had good intentions.A nice start to the series, plenty of action and some humor :) The scenes with Krull and near the edge of the world were one of my many favorites... I sympathize with Rincewind and the vertigo sensation of looking over the edge *shudders* I'd rather stay on land thanks.It seemed alot to cram into one novel, at times my eyes glazed over and I had to re-read a couple passages. Don't get me wrong, it was all interesting but it could've been spread out more.An enjoyable ride nonetheless, this world is one I wouldn't mind living in and/or visit from time to time. Hats off to you once again Mr. Pratchett for bringing this to us :)ReadDavid's excellent review, he captures it wonderfully.
