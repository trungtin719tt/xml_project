Spoilers throughout this bad boy:This was so extremely different from the Vampire Diaries Show and not really in a good way. Elena was not very likeable and she was blonde?!?!?! Weird. She is strong and Katherine is weak?!?! Katherine is dead??? (I believe stefan and Damon believed her to be dead for a while in the beginning of the show, but she most certainly did not choose to kill her own self for their sakes) Stefan wasn't as nice as he is in the show. His darker side definitely was more prominent.Damon was pretty much evil. Not in a sexy and cool way, just plain evil. His relationship with Stefan is MUCH, MUCH worse than in the show.Caroline is awful in the book as well. I adore her on the show, so it is just too weird for her to be so terrible.Bonnie's witchy-ness is not as moving of a story.Do you catch my drift? The Show is far, far better in my opinion than these two books.If I had been rating only "The Awakening", I probably would have given it a 2 star review. I did not enjoy it. There was so much story building and the character were no likeable at all."The Struggle" was much more fun. Damon's character was still evil, but atleast it was entertaining. Elena was more like the character from the show in it.Alone, it would have probably gotten a 2.5 star.... up until that ending!!! I did not see that coming. Props for that! So an extra 1/2 star shall be added.This will not be a book for everyone. People who enjoy Twilight-esque books will probably be into this.Not bad, not great. I will probably give the next book in line a try just to see if it improves.....But, for the most part I'm sticking to the show.
