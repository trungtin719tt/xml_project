Surprisingly, I really enoyed this book. It was almost on the edge of eyerolling, but was rescued just in time.Bianca, an awkward, shy young teenage girl, begins the year at a new school where she meets Lucas, a mysterious boy with bronze hair that warns her away from him while yet another dark haired and muscular boy, Balthazar, whom she thinks of as only a friend, is also interested in her. Sound vaguely familiar?Bianca spends too much time thinking about Lucas, almost to where I was starting to think is this all there is to this book and then, close to halfway through, the story completely changes direction and from that point on, it takes off and the story is different and exciting.The characters are interesting and intriguing and the twists in the second half of the book are great. Looking forward to the next book in the series.
