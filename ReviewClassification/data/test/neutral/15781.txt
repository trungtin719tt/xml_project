Journey to the End of the Nightwas not what I expected. Based on the cover art and description, I had prepared myself for a grim and sombre voyage to the depths of human depravity. Maybe the book simply hasn't aged well, but I thought it was really quite tame - not at all the"literary symphony of violence, cruelty and obscene nihilism"that is promised in the description. And where it does try to push the boundaries, it seems to do so in a very superficial way - for cheap adolescent shock value rather than for any substantial purpose. In some ways the structure and approach felt similar toAugie March, ifAugie Marchhad been written by a horny Frenchman with a particular penchant for legs and asses. The style doesn't help - frankly I found it tedious and obnoxious, and not in the least interesting.The book escapes a lower rating because of the occasional moments when the author seems to remember he is writing a novel - the times when he tones down the obnoxious style and comes out with something really quite excellent. These moments are not infrequent, and they make the book worth persevering with. What a pity about the rest of it.
