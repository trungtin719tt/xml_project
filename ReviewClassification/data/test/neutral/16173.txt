By now most people know that the Bottle-Nose Dolphin is pretty much one of the biggest assholes in the animal kingdom. You know, for randomly hunting down and stalking and killing porpoises, sharks and baby dolphins for no other reason than the pure joy of murdering them in cold blood and so that then can then go off and rape other dolphins.However, theAfrican Bat Bugcould easily surpass the dolphin as one of nature's biggest bastards. Male Bat Bugs seem to have decided one day to pass over the perfectly good female genitalia in order to stab the females in the gut with their bug-wangs. Then they go and stab other males in the gut. Basically they think abdominal wounds are just freakin' hilarious. Nobody knows why these bugs are so damn sadistic.The male African Bat Bug would really like to stab her in the gut. If she were Peter Parker, then I'd kind of understand the compulsionAfter reading Dead Witch Walking, I think I empathize. There is a good story here. A solid story. Just as functional as the female African Bat Bug's vagina (not that I've ever seen one...) yet Kim Harrison doesn't seem content to make this story easy or pleasurable to read. She kind of wants to cause us pain.The part where Nick made a pact with the demon (I'll let you go if you take us home kind of agreements) and then the demon decided later that they owed it more, was just dumb! If you get in a taxi and the driver tells you it'll be fifty bucks home only to wait until you get out of the car and stab you with a knife for not giving it $150, then you'd kind of think that's ridiculous. Yet everyone just seems to go along with this.Rachel can't even quit her freakin' job without having someone try to kill her. This is a world that is just really unnecessarily annoying. I understand she wants to ratchet up the action, but most of it just doesn't make sense. Once again, perfectly good vagina, and Harrison stabs us in the gut.So whilst I didn't think this book was quite as horrible as many other people seem to feel it was, I also can't say that I loved it or was particularly fond of it. I'm interested to see where Harrison takes the characters. The writing was okay and the characterization was interesting and fresh.I applaud Harrison for being somewhat unconventional in her writing and storyline, but there's a different between spicing up the bedroom and splicing up someone's abdominal area with your giant bug banger.
