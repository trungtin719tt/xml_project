It's another teen vampire/romance novel. Yay!Actually, it's kind of cheesy. When Stefan Salvatore shows up at Elena's high school, it's love at first sight. He's gorgeous and exotic, and she's looking for someone new. She's fair-haired and popular and closely resembles his ex.Oh, there's one more thing: Stefan's a vampire. From renaissance Italy. And another thing: his older brother, Damon, has also shown up. And they're battling for Elena's affections.So corny, but so fun to read. The ending was a cliffhanger, so I guess I might just have to pick up the next book in the series.3/10/08
