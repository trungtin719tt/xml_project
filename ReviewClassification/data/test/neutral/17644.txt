Unfortunately this was not as good as it's predecessor,The Clan of the Cave Bear, there was a lot less showing and a lot more telling. I still liked Ayla, even though she was perfect in almost every way (and I don't mean that in a good sense), her emotions where very real. I am totally fascinated by this era, and I'm so glad I was introduced to it byJean M. Auel. Even though I probably won't read more of this series, I have already added some similar titles to my to read list.The Story: Ayla shares a lonely valley with a herd of steppe ponies, harnesses their power, and discovers speech and love with Jondalar, a member of her own race.
