I enjoyed Anne of Avonlea but I did not find it as engaging as Anne of Green Gables. Here's why.Anne of Green Gables gave the reader lots to look forward to. Will Marilla let Anne stay? When will Anne meet Diana? Will she ever forgive Gilbert?While reading Anne of Avonlea, I didn't find myself asking any such questions or looking forward to anything. The book didn't seem to be leading up to anything as far as Anne was concerned. It read more like a series of situations involving Anne while the actual "story" was happening to another character named Miss Lavender. Marilla adoped twins in this one and Montgomery focused so much on the boy, Davy, that I couldn't help but wonder why she bothered to write in his twin sister Dora at all.Anne of Avonlea basically felt like a "passing of time" for Anne. I kept waiting for something to happen to her but it just didn't. I'd still like to continue with the series to see how things progress. Even though Anne of Avonlea didn't quite meet my expectations I found it a charming read and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed Anne of Green Gables. It was nice to visit the old beloved characters again.
