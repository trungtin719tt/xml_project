My book blog:http://yumyabooks.blogspot.comMy Summary: This is the fourth and final book in the bestselling Hush, Hush series. In the previous book, Silence, Nora swore an oath that if Hank Miller (aka The Black Hand and her dad) died, she'd take his place as leader of the Nephilim race. And, naturally, he died so she became the leader. So in Finale Nora is to lead the Nephilim army to war against the fallen angels, which also means against Patch (aka fallen angel and love of her life).Naturally, she doesn't want to do this, so she and Patch devise a plan: lead everyone to believe they are no longer together and while Nora tries to convince the Nephilim not to fight the fallen angels, Patch would be finding out as much as he can about the fallen angels' plans, stopping the war before it even begins.But even the best of plans turn astray and when Nora finds herself with a supposed friend turned into unexpected enemy, and an troubling addiction to deal with, it leaves her unprepared for her most frightening journey yet...It's done. Patch and Nora's story is finished and I'm more than bit sad about that. Although, I must say it ends well and I don't find myself wishing there was another book so I guess that means it's completed.(view spoiler)[It's sad that Scott dies as he was one of my favourite characters and I wish that we could have gotten to know the guy Vee marries three years later although I guess that's not really all that important.At the beginning of the book I liked Dante and when I found out he was the guy being all evil I was rally upset but he turned out to be a bit of a dick so I don't mind so much anymore and I'm glad Nora kicked his ass.(hide spoiler)]Overall I enjoyed this book, yet it's not my favourite in the series.Oh, and Nora totally changes. She goes from sweet protective Nora to manipulative ass-kicking Nora. I actually think I liked the earlier Nora more, it seemed more HER - just saying.
