What a fitting book for my final Hemingway review.A Moveable Feastcaptures so much of what I like about Hemingway (e.g., his staunch commitment to writing, his honest portrayal of emotion) and what I abhor about him (e.g., his sexism, his homophobia, his racism). He has a rather entrancing and pretentious way of writing about Paris, its luxuries and its famous people he often associated with (Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, just to name a few). Yet, between this glitz and glamour rests an underlying sadness, one that he describes when he says, after a horse race, that "I knew everything good and bad left an emptiness when it stopped." I cannot help but wonder how much of Hemingway's writing stems from his efforts to work through his own inner demons, often by projecting a better - yet still problematic - version of himself onto paper. His melancholy does not excuse how he judges and berates women based on their bodies, as well as his other offensive behavior, but his hardship helps to explain it.Again, thank you all for sticking with me through all of these reviews. This has been a challenging semester for me, and while reading Hemingway did not help, your kind words amidst my suffering did. Now, onto works that contain more nuanced interpersonal relationships and advocate for gender equality and social justice!
