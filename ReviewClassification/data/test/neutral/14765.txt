Wild Swans: Three Daughters of Chinacontains the best account of Maoist China that I have read so far. The viewpoint comes from the lineage of three Chinese women and begins before Mao's dictatorship which IMO is a nice touch, because it offers the contrast of the neighborly, respectful, more peaceful China of the past.This is not a short book, and I found the most I could read at a sitting was three chapters due to the denseness. Perhaps, every reader won't feel that way, but I found myself thinking about the culture and events after each reading. This book does included a lot of detail, some of which, probably isn't necessary and doesn't lead up to anything. For the most part, I found those details charming views of Chinese life but some did lead me to ask, "Why was that necessary?" and shake my head in wonderment. I don't mean this as a negative because after all, this is a memoir and Chang has the option of recounting what she selects, but I wish to point out that some events do seem quite trivial and unrelated to the main flow of the book. The writing, especially in the parts where Chang is narrating the lives of her grandmother and mother contains some confusing language that required re-reads to understand which lady she was referring to. The pronouns aren't always placed in the sentence to signify the correct individual.Having said that, Chang travels all over China among different levels of society offering a clear view of life under Mao and his cronies. The reader receives an excellent look at Mao-brand communism and its alteration of Chinese values, morals and culture. I can't imagine any other book capturing the essence of China the way this one does. In spite of its grammatical flaws, I would recommend this book to anyone who wants to know China up close and personal during these eras.Content 5 starswriting 2.5 starsI will remember this book for a long time 4 stars
