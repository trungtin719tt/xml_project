It wasn't a bad story, I'll say that much, but the series does seem to be weakening. The problem for me is the change in focus from vampires onto every other kind of supernatural being you can think of. In the first couple of books of the series, I loved the stories and characters, couldn't get enough of them... and then came werewolves and shifters, I didn't like them as much but I was just about willing to accept them. Then it just got worse and worse. I found that I didn't care about werepanthers or witches or fairies at all.Unfortunately, this installment was almost entirely about the werepanthers and fairies. I honestly couldn't care less about Jason, Crystal, Calvin, Niall, Claudine or Claude. Really, I find none of them interesting or particularly likeable. By far the best part of this book was sexytime with Eric:I will say, without giving too much away hopefully, that there is one main character who never really did anything for me and there is an incident in this book where they nearly die... and I suddenly liked them so much more! I went from being indifferent towards them to thinking: "oh god, you can't die!"I'm just crossing my fingers that Charlaine Harris will bring the focus back to vampires. Some novels about werewolves and shifters and fairies do interest me but the Sookie Stackhouse stories should stay where they belong - with the vamps.
