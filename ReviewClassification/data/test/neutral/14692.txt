The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. A juicy story about the trials and tribulations of Mikael Blomkvist as he struggles to solve the mystery of Harriet Vanger's disappearance forty years ago. An impossible crime; a disgraced journalist and a girl with some very interesting tattoos.Lisbeth Salander, the troubled, genius hacker who aides Mikael in his attempt to solve the decades old crime. First off, I LOVE Lisbeth. She is a girl who has suffered a lot, and she has come out fighting. She takes no crap from anyone, and always gets her revenge, even if it's not totally legal. As a character, she is wonderfully dark, beautifully troubled and endearingly scrappy. A tiny, doll-like girl who manages to assert her dominance over full blown gangsters. And yet, she doesn't come off as bitchy. She only ever bothers with people if they've done her a wrong, otherwise, she "just wants to be left alone."I have no strong feelings on Mikael Blomkvist, save to point out that he's a terrible womanizer.I had heard a lot about this series, and was very interested in the idea, so I took it upon myself to seek them out. It most certainly was a fascinating story, but I have to say I didn't care much for the writing style. Given, it was translated from Swedish, so perhaps it lost something there. However, the story, in my opinion, was worth slogging through the stylistic problems. It is not a story for the fainthearted, that's for sure. This is a dark, gruesome and detailed story, so if you don't have a stomach for the appalling depths of human cruelty, just leave this one on the shelf.On the other hand, if you enjoy heinous crimes and murder mysteries, this one is definitely for you! The movies too, are worth checking out. The actors do wonderful jobs and bring a terrifying story to life.
