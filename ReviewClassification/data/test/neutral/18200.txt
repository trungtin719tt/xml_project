This was an OK book. First off I enjoyed the futuristic feel of the book even though it was written back in the Thirties. The idea of humans being mass produced is pretty wild. The thing that I didn't like about it was the dryness of the book. I did not see a plot buildup nor a very "high" climax in the plot. In some sections the book is really dense and I would have to use Sparknotes on it to try and decipher its meaning. In some other cases it was a good read that I could follow. I am the type of person that if I feel like reading a book, I would want to just sit down and read it. I dont want to use my brain to try and get a small message out of it, but that's just me. The book has a lot of input on politics. I am not into politics so this book was sort of a bust for me. The characters in the book were probably more interesting than the actual book. You have a sex addict (Lenina), a socially awkward penquin (Bernard), a noob (John), and a hypocrite (The Dirsctor). I dont regret reading this book, but I wish that it was a little more entertaining and less prophetic.
