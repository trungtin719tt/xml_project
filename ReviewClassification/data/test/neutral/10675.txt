Alexandr Solzhenitsyn's novel is over wrought like a fence. (It would have to be a barbed wire fence guarded by guards with hard-ons for injustice and big drooling trained guard doggies. One inmate stuck his tongue to the frozen pole on a dare and another can't get his head out because there is no butter.)Heaven exists in the gulag in the shape of snow angels. Arms flapping hopelessly in the snow shapes of angels. We'll lay side by side and look up at the frost cracks in the ceiling tracing the stellar patterns of true north shapes. How could this happen, I ask through my frozen tears (it looks like Johnny Depp's single tear drop in Cry Baby if it were a diamond instead of a tattoo)? All I did was make one lousy joke and the audience sent me to prison. The star stays in the same place, guiding to the same exact same spot of toiling in place. Tomorrow is today.No two snowflakes are alike (still, they are all cold). Alexandr Solzhenitsyn wrote about the gulag a lot. He pretty much only wrote about prison (his cancer book must be prison inside your own dying body). I'd read some years ago a condensed (shhhh) part one (shhhh! My street cred... keep it down!) edition of his The Gulag Archipelago (a library book sale purchase. Feel free to brag I got it for a quarter). I recently read another gulag book. I've read a lot of books about prison these days (I remember when it was my empathetic nightmare. I'll read about skydiving next because I'm fearless). Why would a man who spent an inarguably formative chunk (a chunk like a bread ration! Hey, read enough of these and you'll start thinking in terms of food rations too. Pounds of flesh and ounces of bread. It's my bread and butter, man) of his life in prison want to eek out his mental life in the same cold place? Yesterday is today.I keep reading these because I want to know how each day of the same, that can only end one way, can be different (Eskimos do have a ton of different words for snow). Ways to get through not as much as retaining your own life force beat in a tide you cannot swim against. Something like "Hey, they stole less of my food ration this time" is a good day. Losing your rag to protect against the arctic chill is a bad day. I feel like I know more about the inside of the eyelids day view from that than a big picture. I keep reading the same for the differences. Differences are hope for change. The big picture is too much the same if you view it from outer space (Hi, Laika! We love it here on planet Earth). Can you slow it down enough to tell time?If Solzhenitsyn didn't rule his day like an iron fence... I feel like I know the big picture already. I know it sucks. I know what is probably most likely going to happen (making it out is like a cancer patient beating the odds. You still have to go through cancer and chemo and then spend the rest of your life in the debt to its memory). If there's an eye chart on the wall (It says Stalin! Communism! I can't see the big E for Eternity. Too big) to keep the place like all of the rape scenes in after school specials. "I shut my eyes and waited for it to be over! Teacher had a coffee stain on his tweed coat in the shape of the virgin Mary." The eye charts are the observations based on every other day to determine how this day is going to be exactly the same or slightly better or worse in some slightly different way. The future and the past should be heavier, not THAT day, not the whole damned wall (er, fence). Solzhenitsyn couldn't resist bearing down, I guess. Every day is today. Yesterday. Er, tomorrow. Shukhov's day was less patterns in a snowflake and the sound it makes under boots (if you're lucky enough to have boots). I'm miserable! Weeks turn into months. What's today?They probably had hundreds of different words for shit. There was all different kinds of way to be shit on. It's still shit.Solzhenitsyn must've stewed a lot. I bet he remembered every guy who ever stepped on his toe. (Is it wrong that I was happy he dissed a fake med student inmate who gave injections to helplessly ignorant inmates? Burn, Janusz Bardach! If he knew him specifically, anyway. And he dissed himself? The guy who spent all his time writing about the gulag because it was "important" to document.) Now we'll shoe them! (I swear, that was an honest typo. I really meant to type show.)Pity party contest! Round one:Solzhenitsyn versus Dostoyevsky. Dostoyevsky only served four years in Siberia under the Tsars. They had it so much easier under the Tsars! There was much less lice, a bit more leg room and less slave labor and control. The dogs weren't as good at sniffing out hard-ons yet. Dostoyevsky was such a pussy by comparison. Solzhenitsyn wins!Round two: Solzhenitsyn versus inmates of the Pitesti prison. They'd torture them psychologically as well as physically. Sometimes they'd tell them it had all been a huge mistake and they could go home now. They'd walk them out the front gates and then there would be a guy with a gun to lead them back inside for another prison term. The guards pissed their pants laughing over the hopeful looks on those inmates faces (then they made them clean the pants). The Romanian gulag put the Soviet gulag to shame. Solzhenitsyn was a total pussy by comparison!The winner gets a picket fence.
