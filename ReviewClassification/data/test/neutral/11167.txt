I read this several times as a kid. It was never high up in the series for me. I have to admit that the movie Disney made did such a great job with it that I now appreciate this book more. I didn't much care for Prince Caspian until I saw the movie (Yes, maybe it had something to do with the actor). Still, this is part of a great series and I'm glad another generation has the chance to enjoy them.Men from Earth have oppressed Narnia. Of course they have. The children are called back to help put Prince Caspian back on the thrown. The weird part for me is that C. S. has Peter and Susan too old to come back. They were there for only 2 books and he has ditched them as characters until book 7. Very odd, but it works in the end.
