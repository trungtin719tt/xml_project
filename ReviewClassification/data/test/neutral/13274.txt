3.5One of those books that you can't help saying "Aw, well isn't that sweet" when you finsih it and genuinely mean it.Still had plenty of issues with it. However, compared to the first two, especially the second novelThe Awakening, this one was pretty good, and better than some recently published paranormal novels.Not going to do a full review, just list my biggest complaint with this book. While it did have me saying "Aw" and having a slight smile on my face, that ending isn't a good one, since this is the last book in the trilogy. Hopefully, when I start the Darkness Rising trilogy (I'll be readingThe Gatheringafter I finish TWO MORE books) the story arc will be wrapped up.I mean, what was accomplished that ends the story? They're still in a pretty similar situation to the beginning of the book. They're still on the run from the Cabals, and the Edison Group. Nothing was really wrapped up, and there's still many questions left unanswered: is Rae really safe? Is the EG still going to keep up with their DNA modification? Compared to some series finale books, this one doesn't feel conclusive.It probably was left that way, since I know that Chloe and Co. are meant to make an appearance sometime in the DR trilogy.Now, the one thing that I actually really liked about this book: the romance. It's nothing perfect by any means, and it's not that deep and personal and life changing, but it's sweet, innocent, and feckin' HEALTHY. Chloe voices her opinions about how Derek should treat her, and he LISTENS. Not only that, but it's not the kind of relationship riddled with more angst than plot, and it's definitely not the "Now my life is forever complete and I'll never need anything else in my life again" kind of romance.All that I really have to say.
