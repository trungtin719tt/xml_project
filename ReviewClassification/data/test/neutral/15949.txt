Buddy read with Megha, Roh, Adita, Parthi, Nameeta, and Poonam. I can see why this book is so famous. I can see how Huxley, Bradbury, and Orwell were inspired by him. I can see how this book inspired every other future dystopian novel. However, it was rather underwhelming. Maybe it was this particular translation, but I felt like the focus here was more on the language, than on the theme. While that worked for Bradbury, it doesn't work here.I know I need to review this and others in full, just give me a couple of days.
