It's weird if someone saw me reading poetry in public, why? I never ever enjoyed reading poetry since the day I was born. The day that my Elementary teacher forced me to memorize an Evangelical Hymn,All Things Bright and Beautiful- in whichJames Herriotentitled his books - and to my 3rd Year High School teacher who required us to memorizeAnnabelle LeebyEdgar Allan Poeto pass her exam and so on.If I have the chance to change my past, I want to change my love to poetry. I'm sure if anybody here read Neruda's beautiful poems, they will love them and they will never forget every single word he sang. I might also ask my teachers to change their syllabus and add good poets like Neruda and the others. I don't know why teachers are forced to follow text books?Who isPablo Neruda? I never heard of him but when one of theFlippersvolunteered to be a moderator for the month of February and chose Neruda's poetry I was forced to buy his small book and read it. It takes me a while to feed myself with poetry, but it takes only a minute to finish a poem and it takes hour to feel the joy and sadness of every words.Back to my question,Pablo NerudaorRicardo Eliecer Reyeswas a poetic genius and he was awarded because of his ability to write good poems in a very young age. On his 20 years of existence, he published his first book and loved by many, it was a success. Because his father opposed to his writing ideas, he was forced to change his name toPablo Neruda, from a historical novelistJan Neruda, to avoid his father's disapproval.Pablo NerudapracticeModernismon his poem.Modernism, it hailed the fragmentation of daily life and the emphasis individuals experience. It takes only a few years forModernismto be lost and forgotten by anyone. If you read his poem, it was simple and easy to read.Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despaira collection of poems of love, regret and passion. Below are the two (2) poems I loved from his collection.VIII - White BeeWhite bee, you buzz in my soul, drunk with honeyand your flight winds in slow spirals of smoke.I am the one without hope, the word without echoes,he who lost everything and he who had everything.Last hawser, in you creaks my last longing.In my barren land you are the final rose.Ah you who are silent!Let your deep eyes close. There the night flutters.Ah your body, a frightened statue, naked.You have deep eyes in which the night flails.Cool arms of flowers and a lap of rose.Your breasts seem like white snails.A butterfly of shadow has come to sleep on your belly.Ah you who are silent!Have you tried looking at the window and you saw the woman you love in white, dancing, jolly, and happy like there is no tomorrow. You only wish is to be with her and fall in your deepest dream of touching her body. Maybe Neruda felt joy and sadness writing his poems especially the last one, the most lonely and my least favorite.I - Body of a WomanBody of a woman, white hills, white thighs,when you surrender, you stretch out like the world.My body, savage and pleasant, undermines youand makes a son leap in the bottom of the earth.I was lonely as a tunnel. Birds flew from me.And night invaded me with her powerful army.To survive I forged you like a weapon,like an arrow for my bow, or a stone for my sling.But now the hour of revenge falls, and I love you.Body of skin, of moss, of firm and thirsty milk!And the cups of your breasts! And your eyes full of absence!And the roses of your mound! And your voice slow and sad!Body of my woman, I will live on through your marvelousness,My thirst, my desire without end, my wavering road!Dark river beds down which the eternal thirst is flowing,and the fatigue is flowing, and the grief without shore.You are in a dark room with someone you love, looking at her body with passion. Touching every angle and the only light who guides you are the grayish light of the old maiden, moon. This must be a simplest poem on his collection and I really enjoyed the way she explained the body of a woman like you draw a woman in a canvas.The book also include Pablo Picasso's art of couples and nude women. This is one of Pablo Picasso's art, being animated and trying to depict two lovers in a sense of portraying it magically.Rating-Twenty Love Poems and a Song of Despairby Pablo Neruda,3 Sweetsand the night I saw a nude woman sleeping under the beautiful goddess of moon. (I don't read much about poems and I don't know if I have the right to rate this book. In some point I really enjoyed reading it! Recommended to everyone who loves to fall in love, another problem for me, I can't relate.)Challenges:Book #22 for 2011Book #14 forOff the Shelf!
