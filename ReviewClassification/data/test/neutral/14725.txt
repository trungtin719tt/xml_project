I read this book for my hometown book club. Surprisingly, I have never heard of Shutter Island, but now after reading this book I will have to check out the movie too.I was hoping for this book to be much better than it was. Even after reading it I feel it could have been but there were soooo many twists and turns I couldn't keep up. I love when books catch you by surprise or completely change. However, this book was not executed well and had too many twists and turns that the author didn't execute them well.The main character, U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels, and his partner, Chuck Aule, take a boat to Shutter Island. This is the Hospital for the Criminally Insane and they were requested to come to investigate the escape and find one of a patient.
