My Ridiculously Simplified Synopsis: Very Dear John-ish and The Rescue-ish.I kinda hate this book, but I tell you, this is a touching story. For me, this is the saddest of all the books of Sparks, so far.An epitome of the world's greatest regret, letting go of someone even if you really love him/her.Like what I said yesterday, it was hard for me to get in to the book at first but I soon completely fell in to it, holding on to the moments of bliss till the loneliest part of the book. There are a few bits that were unrealistic but some issues were really nicely touched. A weepy one for sure.I kinda hate this book cause it's so tragic, what more can you ask from this novelist. Nicholas Sparks always manages to pull a string of the heart. The beautiful complexity and the depth of love is so touchingly told. I dont think anyone normal can hold tears, though I have to re read the last part of the book later to make the latter statement veritable for myself.One thing I learned from this book: You can always let go of someone, always, but it takes time, and of course to complete the formula, find someone who makes you happy, and of course, fight for it, no matter what.Theresa's kinda foolish, Garret's a big disappointment too. And after reading the first half of the book, I knew that the two will soon make the greatest mistakes of their lives. Though I liked how Theresa handled everything in the end. A perfect example of how everybody should move on, to stop living life in the past. To move, and love again.Romantic, sad, amazing, depressing.
