I remember over the years, I would come acrossStill Life with Woodpeckerevery now and then in bookshops and book bazaars. Each time, I would take it in my hands, read the backcover and put it back on the shelve. I don't know why, although it seemed interesting to me, something always stopped me from buying it. Of course I was aware of all the praise about it but that is never enough for me to want to read a book.I think I get why it became such a big success all over the world. Its romantic and at the same time cynical aura can be appealing to people of both sexes. But let's face it people. It's not a masterpiece. While it's full of cheesy themes and everyday philosophy, it lacks the ingredients that make a novel timelessly brilliant. Now, I'm not saying it's trash. On the contrary, I found it good with moments of awesomeness. And that's it. In fact, I thinkJitterbug Perfumeis better on many levels. Truth is though, had I read it when I was younger, I probably would have liked it more.The humor is nice, although after a while it feels a bit forced. Storywise, it lost me from time to time probably due to all the abstract blabbering. I think it's clear that finally it left me with a feeling of... meeehh.
