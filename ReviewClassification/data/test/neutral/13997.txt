3.5 starsSo I listened to the Playaway audio version, and it was good! Instead of someone reading the story, this one has awhole castreading it like a play. There's even sound effects!{insert booming thunder}I know, right?!So, yeah, that was very cool!Now, as far as the actualplaygoes?Eh. It was ok.Wait, wait, wait! Before you tell me I'm an idiot (debatable), and that this was the best thing since sliced cheese, let me remind you that I waslisteningto this sucker, so it's not like I could study the words for a few seconds or anything.People with accents were speaking in some sort ofYe Olde Englishith, and some of it got lost in translation for me.Plus, I'm used to reading mostly comic books, so my brain wandered off a few times while I was listening to this. &lt;---Thiswill become a very important thing to remember later in this review.shrugsHere's what I got out of it:Witches! Witches everywhere!Yeah, random witches did this singsong thing, and rambled on for a bit about things that I couldn't quite make out. I'm going to assume they made predictions, and I'm going to assume the predictions were important.Double, double, toil and trouble...plus some other stuff.Evil queen alert!Yep. Some poor dude is about to get done in by his wife.Bet he's wishing he'd remembered their anniversary about right now...Apparently, she's having an affair with Macbeth, and talks him into killing her hubby, KingWhatshisname? Doesn't matter, he's dead pretty much right off the bat.Right away, Macbeth becomes king, and (I guess)inheritsLadyWhatshernameMacbeth. All is going according to plan!Edit:Hey, guess what?! None of that affair stuff happened! Yeah, it seems as though I totally misinterpreted all of it. Shocking that I could do something like that!(view spoiler)[Look, you guys could at least PRETEND to be shocked. I'm not asking for much, here, am I? Just a little bit of support as I try to become better read, more well-rounded, and expand my horizons. So, you know, GASP! or something, goddamnit!(hide spoiler)]Guess Lady Macbeth was just a power-hungry twat that talked her henpecked hubby into stabbing his buddy in his sleep.Still, I think my version is cooler, and William should think about writing my idea into this play, you know?Now, here's where the plot got (more) murky for me.I guess Mr. Macbeth started killing off Olde King Whatshisname's supporters, and made himself some enemies.Plus, Lady M starts to lose her mindjust a tad, and starts wandering around at night scrubbing imaginary blood off of her hands.Out, damned spot!Is it guilt? OCD? Or just the lack of a good pre-soak agent?Time to get more good advice from thewitches!Bubble, bubble, you're in trouble...plus other stuff.Lady BigMac loses it completely, offs herself, and leaves Macbeth to deal with the consequences on his own. What a bitch, right?!But that's ok, because he doesn't seem to spend much time mourning her.It must have been lovebut it's over now. It must have been good but I lost it somehow...Whatever. She's dead, and these other dudes out there arepissedbecause he killed off their families, and besmirched their good names.You tell 'em I'm coming... and hell's coming with me, you hear?... Hell's coming with me!But Macbeth ain't skeered, see? 'Cause he's got this prophecy that the witches gave him, tucked into his back pocket.No man born from a woman will ever defeat you.So, I was thinking,Ooooh! Hey, I'll bet that means some chick is gonna stab his ass!, but I was wrong.The twist was waaaay better.Emergency C-Section, for the win!And that's it, kiddies.*takes a bow*
