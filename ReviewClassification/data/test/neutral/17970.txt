This book has a lot of similarities to the first in the series,Perfect Chemistry--at the beginning, it felt like the only difference was that Kiara had a stutter. After finishing it, I still feel it was substantially similar in characters and plot but I don't give a crap. I still really liked it.In other news, I know some people are fans of the cover art in this series but I think it is pretty mortifying. AfterPerfect Chemistry's cover, where Alex and Brittney are laying on each other in the cover art, I saw this one and thought, "thank goodness I am not living with my Boston roommates anymore--they made fun of me for reading the other one and this one is even more ridiculous!" Did you see the cover for the third book in the series,Chain Reaction? THEY ARE SHOWERING TOGETHER. I would never read that book on the T. (public transportation) Buuuuut, that brings me to something else.The sexiness. Whoa, mama. I listened to this one on audiobook and it was pretty hot. I enjoyed the romance aspects of this book more than most of the romances I read. What's that you say? That's kind of gross since I'm 27? Well, FU, I don't care what you say. Also, Carlos sounds hot. Alex was hot, too. It stands to reason that Luis will be hot, too. If there is a shower scene in book three, I am totally there. Oh wait, I was there anyway.Speaking about sounding hot, it was pretty interesting to hear the shifting first person narration in this novel. I've never encountered this in an audiobook before--when Carlos is narrating, a Mexican (well, I didn't look him up, maybe the voice actor just does an amazing accent) man narrates and every character sounds like they would from Carlos' point of view--so Brittney, the professor, Tuck, and Brandon all have quasi-Mexican accents. And when Brittney narrates, the female voice actor impersonates Carlos and Alex's voices. At first, I felt that it was off-putting but I got used to it over time and I think it actually added to my experience.
