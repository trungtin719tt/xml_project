It was okay... It definitely felt like more of a shot fired at the tobacco companies. It should have focused more on the story instead. As such, there isn't a huge amount of drama. There are tons of Grisham books so I'd advise you start elsewhere, likeA Time to Kill.All in all, this was just a bit drab for my liking.
