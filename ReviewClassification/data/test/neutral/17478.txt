Talk about 'condemned by faint praise'! This book was okay. It was too long and too predictable.I enjoyed the first 2/3 of this book but when I realised the author really was going to go for the saccharine ending, the wind was taken out of my sails.. Until then my only real niggling doubt had been the plausibility of some of the story line. Would there really still be so much canned food and fizzy drink lying around after 7 years? Would they really still have gas left for their vehicles? Would the settlement of Mary's Rest really go from being a feral, brutal, violent bunch of muggers and rag tags, to a loving and supportive community, literally over night?Ultimately this book was reductive and moralistic in a way I didn't much care for. Take Job's Mask, for example : a hard and crusty face covering developed over the years by victims closest to the point of the nuclear explosions. When these masks crack and fall off, all the good guys have developed smooth and flawless skin and a healthy head of hair, ' their true souls shining through'. Can you guess what happens to the villains?! They end up with very ugly faces because they have been very, very bad! No shades of grey for this author, no siree!The characters develop predictably as does the whole story. The 'crown' hailed as the main magical saviour of all the good people, seems to just ebb away. Items that were almost too much for me: the reappearance of the president, the sunshine and the stars, 'though I think the author forgot the rainbows and unicorns.....I thought this book would be better, from the reviews I read. It's not a great indictment that at 83% of the book I wasn't sure I had the will to go on, especially when the book is such a lengthy one. I'd come so far...In the end, it was an interesting enough account of a post apocalyptic world. I have seen it compared and contrasted to The Stand. To my mind they are about the same in terms of quality and interest and in their possible use as a door stop. Ultimately though, The Road is a superior post apocalyptic account and it's much more concise and spare and therefore effective in its delivery.
