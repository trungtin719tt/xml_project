Every review of this series talks about it being one of the best Urban Fantasies out there, and I have to admit that the world in this one is pretty awesome. I liked everything about the world.So, why the three-stars? Because I have a little pet-peeve with something that I can easily spot for the future of this series. And, yes, I have so many book pet-peeves that my house smells like a pet-peeve litter box, but still..... I can't resist their cute little faces.I know this one doesn't go THAT well, but gosh-darn-it-all, it made me laugh.Rachel, our heroine, meets up with Mr. Baddie, Trent, and he almost kills her and greatly injures her, cages her and allows his assistant to physically abuse her for sadistic pleasure, threatens her, and then tries to have her die by rats,butshe is ogling his ass the whole time. Plus, maybe, just maybe he is Mr. Misunderstood instead of Mr. Baddie. And, I'm like"Oh HELL to the NO!!"This is such a set-up for him to be a future love-interest!Now, I admit that bad boys can be pretty cute and irresistible.....Who's a cute little bad boy? You are!BUT, thegoodkind of bad boy has to be the one who treats his woman like a freaking princess, yet is a badass and will do anything to protect her. Reformed bad boys are also good. Along with reformed rakes. The point is... Yes, forgiveness is divine, but if Rachel is going to forgive this guy for letting his creepy side-kick torture her for kicks and trying to kill her... I'm NOT on board with that.Trent? My reaction to you is that of the male octopus to a potential mate:
