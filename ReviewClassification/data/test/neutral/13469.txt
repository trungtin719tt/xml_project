This is another one of my airport finds. There was a time I was passing an average of 28 minutes a day in a plane, which in fact means I was traveling two or more times a week, every week. And having to wait many long hours for my flights, I survived by checking the many airports bookstores for bargains. Such activity soon became a well-rewarded hobby.This one book I took because the price was right and the cover seemed attractive. There was only one blurb in the back but it was intriguing enough for me to buy the book.The Gargoyle is, at it core, a love story. Told across time and using other stories than those of the protagonists to fill the gaps about what love is, or it ought to be. But it is also a tragedy, not in the literary way of a protagonist never changing his core beliefs, but in the sense of ending with death.It is not the most original book but it has its moments. There's a lot about burning victims and their treatment, so if your squeamish about such stuff, this may not be the book for you.I personally felt a bit disappointed with the ending, but that's a personal thing, others may find the ending uplifting.
