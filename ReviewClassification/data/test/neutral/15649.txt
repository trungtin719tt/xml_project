Ok, so this is a prequel to Fallen and Torment,following Luce and Daniel's most important moments in 5000+ years...Sounds goooodddd:)... So, this book is definitely my favourite of the Fallen Series, I think it's fair to say that they keep getting better.Definitely a hybrid prequel, and I really enjoyed it...Liking all the characters a lot more this time around, too!:)Looking forward to Rapture in 2012!Trying to figure out if the fact that I've read Paradise Lost has made the book more enjoyable or less so... I think there were bits that bothered me, and parts that I further understood because of Paradise Lost... =)
