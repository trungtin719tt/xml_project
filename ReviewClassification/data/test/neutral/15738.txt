I read this 7 or 8 years ago and thought I'd re-read it to see if I like it any better (since everyone seems to love this book).It is a good book that I didn't enjoy all that much.I think there are children's book and YA books that can be enjoyed equally by children and by adults but I don't think this is one of them. I think this is a 5 star book for a 12 year old but it just doesn't do that much for me. Good characters and good plot but the lack of depth bothered me as an adult reading the story.I would recommend this to most any pre-teen and teen.
