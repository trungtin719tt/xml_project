I nice bridge book in a series, IMO. Alyson Noel is doing the age old "boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back..." thing. But, she does it well and I'm definitely interested in her storyline. It's not my fave book, but I like it!*SPOILER ALERT**I do believe that the next book will right the wrongs and get our characters back where they belong-in eachothers arms! :-) And I'm looking forward to whatever struggle she is inventing between our good and evil characters.Things that bugged me-IKNEWsomething wasn't right with Ava (what was she thinking leaving immortal juice with her anyway!).-What was her rush to get back to her old life?? Could she not wait to make sure the love of her life was ok b4 hurtling back to Summerland and back to he rold life? Crazy!-What is the deal with her believing what Roman says over the creepy twin?! She hates him the whole book doesn't trust him for a second and all of a sudden she believes him over someone who she has no reason to disbelieve!-And finally, why didn't Damen recognize Roman? Huh...So, overall- an ok read, but she needs make sure her characters are doing the things that they would actually do, not just having things happen because it advances her plot with no regard to whether it makes sense or not.
