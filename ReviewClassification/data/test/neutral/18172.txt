Maybe I am disappointed because I had high expectations for this book. Maybe because it was the first time I read it and I couldn't comprehend the deeper meaning of this book. Maybe I detested the utterly terrible and disgraceful words that were used to describe women. Yes. That's the reason I disliked this book. Women were portrayed as weak and without will beings. Sure there were many things that bothered me besides Zorba's views on women (which were repulsive if you ask me) and of course there were moments when I enjoyed the book. But overall , I couldn't wait to finish it (since I had an on and off relationship with this one)Well maybe the next time I read it I will appreciate it? I will understand it well enough to say I enjoyed it? Oh how much I wanted to like it , but for now I detest it.
