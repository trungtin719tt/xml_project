Original Rating: 5 starsNew rating: 3 starsThe first half of this book was extremely boring and mostly filler. The second half was pretty great.PRO: Bill leaves in the beginning.CON: Sookie does a bunch of boring stuff around Bon Temps.PRO: Sookie meets Alcide.CON: Alcide is so boring in the books.PRO: Russell Edgington is in this book.CON: Russell Edgington is so boring in the books.PRO: Eric Northman. Eric Northman. Eric Northman.Overall, this series in retrospect is kind of sucky and doesn't have the bite it used to (for me at least). I probably won't read this one again. I fear my love for this series has finally met the true death. I might re-read book 4 though, just because it's Eric's main book.The writing is so cheesy and not very good, and the bulk of the story is mainly filler. It just doesn't do it for me anymore.But I still give this one 3 Eric Northman stars.Only because the action in the last half was still pretty good.I'll always love the TV show, True Blood (until the craptastic last season). The show really brought the characters alive and is so much better than the books, in my view. For example, Talbot and Lorena are in this book (Talbot is still Russell's lover and Lorena is still Bill's maker and one-time lover), but they were reinvented in the best way for the show. I loved True Blood Lorena and Talbot. Here, you could almost miss them if you blinked.
