While striking, unique, scattered with profound verse, I just couldn't jive with you Mr. Frost. I flipped through this book, because honestly I'm not going to read 600 pages of random Robert Frost. So, I started by just checking out all the classic Frost poems from: "The Road Not Taken", "Fire and Ice", "Dust of Snow", to "Birches". They are pretty. I actually enjoyed a few of them, thought they were unique and beautiful, especially, "Death of a Hired Man" and "A Considerable Speck".I learned two things while reading through these...where hipsters get excepts of their tattoos from and I'm not a huge fan of the poetry of Robert Frost, but I do find the man himself rather interesting.*Not to say while reading I didn't run into a few poems that reached out to me, I just can't justify a few poems or a line here or there as classifying myself as a Frost Fan. I get it though.
