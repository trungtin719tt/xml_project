This is a very good story that is incredibly researched. However, in this instance, I'd have to say the movie is better. The reason is that the movie is simplified. This is a very complex book involving military strategy. Even being a ten year veteran of our armed forces, and familiar with military language and acroynms, I found this book slow to read. The author did extensive research into soviet and allied submarines in particular, but also all naval vessels and even aircraft. He receits specifications frequently throughout the book. It's not out of place or inappropriate, but it's not easy for the average civilian reader to follow at times. The movie simplified this. I choose this Clancy novel to start with as I loved the movie. But after taking two weeks to read this, I'll have to decide if I want to read any others. I'm curious to follow Jack Ryan's career, but doubt I could get through all 12 or 14 books in this series.
