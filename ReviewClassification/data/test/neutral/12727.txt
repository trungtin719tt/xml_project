"Your lips are bloody." He seized my face in both hands and kissed me.It's hard not to respond when a master of the art of kissing is laying one on you.The best part of this book is every scene Eric Northman is in. While this one was definitely better than the first book, it wasn't as good as it was the first few times I read it. Definitely not a 5-star book, as I originally rated it.This one has two main plots which are separate from each other: the maenad coming to Bon Temps and the encounter with the Fellowship of the Sun in Dallas. Sookie gets "loaned out" by Eric to use her telepathy to help a nest in Dallas, led by vampire uber-nerd, Stan. Neither storylines are overly gripping (I did like the scenes with Stan), but there are some stand out moments.Book Steve and Sarah Newlin are cardboard cut-outs compared to the hilarious Newlins on True Blood.I much prefer what they did with Godric on the show as well (called Godfrey here). My favorite scene (besides the bullet-sucking one) was when Eric goes to the "orgy" near the end with Sookie.I probably won't re-read this one again, but I still give it three Eric Northman stars.
