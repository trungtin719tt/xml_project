My status updates aside, this was a pretty good book. A nice breath of fresh air in the over-saturated world of paranormal YA rubbish.A wonderfully different take on werewolves, and a really nice, fast paced story/mystery. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next.If youdidread my status updates, the author does need a bit of help in understanding the economy of words. A few examples:"Her mug clattered into the stainless steel basin.""Her mug clattered into the sink." works just fine--gets the image across perfectly &amp; succinctly. Economy of words is a great premise."He poured tall, dark liquid from the thermos."Was the coffee also handsome? "Tall, dark liquid"??? So silly. We don't need flowing prose about coffee.And my favorite:"Unwelcome searing liquid pooled in my eyes."Did I mention the concept of "economy of words"? The word "tears" would have worked just fine here--actually, it would have been better. I listened to this book on audio, and when I first heard "Unwelcome searing liquid..." I thought someone threw something caustic at her.Any thoughts I have on the love triangle would be spoilers, so here we go...(view spoiler)[At first, I thought Ren was an arrogant man-slut, and was excited about the prospect of Shay. But Shay proceeded to annoy me as the book went on, and Ren proceeded to grow on me. I appreciate that the author didn't completely shut the door on Ren, but his prospects don't look very good. I think what bugged me the most was Calla gave Shay chance after chance--he was a little snot? She forgave him. He stepped on toes? She forgave him. She spent atonof time with him, sneaking around to see him. But she never gave Ren anything. Not her time, not kindness, not forgiveness. He tried numerous times to spend some time with her, and she never had time for him. But she completely bent the rules and put her life in danger to make time for Shay.I guess I just wish the author would have given Ren a fair shake. It's not really a love triangle when one guy doesn't get even a fraction of the attention the other guy gets.(hide spoiler)]Oh, and one last thing. The author should have written in a few cold showers for Calla. This girl was a comical sensory trip. This boy makes her shiver, that boy makes her shake. This boy makes her breath stop, that boy makes her limbs go numb. It was over the top. When I start laughing when I read the next physical description of Calla's 0-60 desire, that means you've gone a bit too far. ;)
