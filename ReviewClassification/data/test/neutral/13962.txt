A good read, but nowhere near as gripping and emotionally involving as the first Night Huntress installment.I had tons of fun readng One Foot in the Grave because of the wit, snarkiness, and generally funny moments all over the book. This one resembled the last book in that way. I've picked out some of my favorite quotes/passages:"Life's a bitch and then one stabs you."Just like old times, I thought ironically. I look like a slut, and Bones is my backup while I go after murdering fang-bangers. The only thing that would make this complete would be to take off my underwear.Then I smiled. And went back into the stall."You know the old saying. Once you go dead, no one's better in bed.""What's next? You going to whip out a dick and say you're really a man?""Wrong way, Bones. The men's showers are in the oppostie direction.""I'll file that away with all the other information that doesn't pertain to me.""You will pay with pain for that."What was I supposed to say? It wasn't good for me, either?So needless to say I laughed a lot in the process of reading. This book made me very happy.However I did have some issues with it. For one, Cat slut-shames a lady at a wedding, and I can't stand people who slut-shame. How can women do that to each other? I expected better from Cat.My biggest problem was Bones and Cat's relationship. Even after spending 4 years apart, when they meet again it's like nothing can ever bring them apart again. I'm glad Cat and Bones are so perfect for one another, but it doesn't motivate me to keep reading. If no obstacle can create serious conflict in their relationship, then why should I read about it? No conflict = nothing driving the plot = nothing to interest me. I could just congratulate Cat and Bones on their perfect love lives and move on to a different series.
