Just...boring. I don't have anything too, too negative to say, but I also don't have anything super positive to say either.All of the characters were flat; they lacked a necessary flair &amp; zest. They weren't complex, and they didn't surprise me.It was slow moving &amp; uneventful, but easy to read once you actually convinced yourself to pick the book back up.Eh, the girl support in this book was refreshing after having read a few contemporaries where the MC ripped other girls apart because of how they dressed, looked, etc. That's definitely a notable plus of this book.There are better Sarah Dessen books than this one, so unless you're on a mission to read all of her published works (like I am), then I'd ultimately give this one a pass.
