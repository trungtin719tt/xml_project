Once again, Harris has continued to improve from one book to the next, thought it still has its flaws. The story starts a little slow, and gets monotonous at times, but it picks up toward the end, making the overall book pretty enjoyable. These books truly are like candy for the brain.I was very pleased to find that Bill was missing in action for most of this installment, but despite the reprieve, he still managed to inspire a whole new level of loathing on my part. I hope that Harris doesn't allow Sookie and Bill to repair their dysfunctional relationship in future books as I would be forced to stop reading in fear of exciting my gag reflex.It was also appealing to learn more about Harris's supernatural world as details about the vamp universe remains at large, and info about shifters and weres remain vague at best, which I suspect is Harris's way of making stuff up without us being able to call her on it. Kind of a genius tactic on her part really.The introduction of Alcide into the series was a bit annoying; does every guy have to fall in love with Sookie? And I physically cringed when Sookie talked about how great he was simply due to the fact that he had a "man" job, drove a truck and used good manners. Hello, I don't like Nicholas Spark books, if I wanted to read about bland characters, I'd go out and procure a copy of Dear John. However, despite Alcide being a card board cutout of all things dull, Eric was absolutely delicious and as always, was the main cause for my enjoyment of this book.Sookie is still painstakingly daft as she continues to spend more than a few pages devoted entirely to her clothes and hair. I was pleased that she only mentioned her breasts once, though I suspect they were replaced with her nails as she mentions them ten times too many. They are painted gold by the way, in case you were wondering.
