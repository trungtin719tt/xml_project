The House of Mirth is a tragic tale of the life of Miss Lily Bart, a beautiful young girl who is raised to aspire in wealth and luxury. Being raised as an ornament to catch the eye of a rich man, she is not skilled in anything except in the art of being beautiful and agreeable. But the mean and selfish New York elite are too much for her to handle who do not hesitate to use her in their wile schemes and unjustly cast her off.The story brings out an unpleasant side of the upper class New York society with its false friendships, betrayals, jealousies, the scandals and ugly gossip. Being a member of this society herself, author paints a true picture of this nasty side of the New York upper society hidden in layers of glamour.Lily Bart is a complex character. It was not easy to connect with her. I really couldn't for the most part of the story. She is a vain, proud and self-centered girl who has too much faith in her self-importance. And it was not easy to like her. She was indeed a victim of the society but for the most part it was self-brought. Her imprudent actions and her love for material fineness takes her in the destructive and degrading path. Toward the end of the story, however, a different personality of Lily Bart comes to light. Inside the vain self-centered girl lives a young woman who sees the shallowness in her actions and the superficial life which she aspires to live in even though she cannot find strength to free her from the desire for such living. And she is also a principled woman who does not demean herself by avenging the injustice that was done to her by resorting to dishonorable conduct. This new side of Lily brought me close to her and I felt her tragedy profoundly.The author has centered her story on Lily, and the rest of the characters played only secondary roles in highlighting the tragic life story of Lily Bart. Out of these characters, Lawrence Selden takes prominence. He truly loves Lily but loathes the life to which she aspires, and out of his love for her, tries hard to make her see reason (though in vain). Other than Lily, Lawrence Selden is the only likable character, most of others being too shallow for any consideration. He represents ethics and morality. But was he too severe? or was he a coward? These questions do not find a definite answer in the story.Wharton's asset is her writing. The beauty of her prose is captivating the reader. Nevertheless the story is a little overwritten. This reason and the fact the story was wholly centered on the single character of Lily, her actions and her thoughts made the read a bit tedious. I wish Wharton had made more use of the other characters in the story to give it little more colour and vibrancy.Overall, it was a good read. Henry James once has said to Edith Wharton that she writes best when she writes within her element. I fully agree with him.
