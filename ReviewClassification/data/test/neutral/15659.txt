So I've decided to dip my toes back into the waters of the utterly bonkers but always hilarious Discworld Series by the late, great Terry Pratchett. I've only read odd books here and there, and certainly have never read the books in order. Honestly I don't have that sort of patience. So instead I prefer to flit in and out focusing more on the books featuring my favourite characters. I tend to find the plots, and even the characters at times, just superfluous to the reading experience! For me it's ALL about the humour.Mort is technically the fourth novel in the series but can be considered a starter novel for those stories revolving around Death as a main character. Death has always been my favourite character in the Discworld series. He's one of thefictionalcharacters that I'd like to invite to my 'fantasy dinner party with literary characters of my choosing'...Along with Ford Prefect, maybe Jo March, definitely Dennis the Dragon, Jane Eyre &amp; Mr Rochester (every dinner party needs some awkward marital tension!!) andMr DarcyMr CollinsWho could resist being complimented on ones boiled potatoes?!?!?Honestly this review is pretty useless and mostly irrelevant regarding the occurrences of the book because I don't know what to say about it!! Yes it's light on plot, light on character development etc...but sometimes that's not everything.So most importantly, I laughed.A lotAt passages like this one:"As the light distilled from silver to gold Mort galloped across a flat, chilly landscape, chequered with cabbage fields from edge to edge. There are many things to be said about cabbages. One may talk at length about their high vitamin content, their vital iron contribution, the valuable roughage and commendable food value. In the mass, however, they lack a certain something; despite their claim to immense nutritional and moral superiority over, say, daffodils, they have never been a sight to inspire the poet's muse. Unless he was hungry, of course."I guess this sort of humour clicks with me. I'm hoping to read all the books in the Death series: Mort (this one), Reaper Man, Soul Music, Hogfather and Thief of Time... But I may just pop in on other character books too. Some people do say that it's best to read the books in order to fully get all the nuances of character and plot etc but I've never found the need to do that. Plus the first two Discworld books are definitely not as good.So when in the mood for one, I simply pick up any of the books to hand and just know I'm going to start laughing.three and a half starsI came acrossthis helpful guideas to how to read the Discworld novels if you don't want to follow publishing order.
