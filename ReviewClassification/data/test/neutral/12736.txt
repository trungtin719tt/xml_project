Now I've seen the show and I never knew it was a whole book series. I know, I know, I'm a terrible person who should never read a book or watch TV ever again. I'm sorry.I actually kind of like the book because I think it was better than the show - but only for that reason.Living Dead in Dallaswas a fast read, to me at least, and it definitely kept my interest. I love murder mystery books and I've been on a huge kick with that type of genre lately. Sookie seems okay to me. I don't really like or hate the girl but I am hoping she gets more interesting in the next book or later in the series. Bill also seems okay but mostly boring. I just keep picturing the actors from the TV show and I can't decide if it makes the character better or worse off.I have no idea when I will read the next book in this series. I just hope that everything and everyone gets better.
