This book goes something likes this:Elend and the group:Hey, we need to find a way to defeat these two armies, led by tyrants, who've come to conquer the city.Elend and the group:Yes, we should! But first, let us talk about it for 500 pages.Anyway, I've read many reviews that mention this book is slow paced, but to even describe this book merely 'slow-paced' is a big understatement. I think glacial pace describes it much better. You keep thinking it's going to pick up, after all, it's 700 pages, so what if it's slow for the first 200, but no, it had to be slow for nearly 600 pages.Nonetheless, I really liked how well everything ties up at the end. It was planned excellently.
