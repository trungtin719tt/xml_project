Sigh. Sookie, Sookie, Sookie, your fashion sense is still stuck in the eighties. I blame this on the author, who no doubt thinks she's writing you up to date. I myself, did a face palm, when I read about your lipstick matching your red earrings and your red socks with your black work pants. Yeah, I did that in junior high, too. Questionable fashion aside, I still really enjoy this character. She had some tough times this book, what with having no sexual escapades (the first time ever, although it seems like every male in the town is interested in her--must be the red socks), getting shot, and having part of her house burn down. Unfortunately, it was just her back porch and kitchen that burned, so her collection of hair scrunchies were saved. I've also decided that I'm pretty well over the werewolves in this book. Alcide, a character I liked in past books, is kind of a jerk here and the whole head of the pack competition grossed me out. That said, I'm happy to read the next in the series.
