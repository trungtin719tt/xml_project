Chandrapore, India during the British Raj in the 1920s. This is about a British young woman,Adela Questedfalsely accusing an Indian doctor,Dr. Azizof attempted rape. During the trial, Adela withdrew her lawsuit and admitted her mistake. The false accusation, the trial and the retraction further divided the nation between the white colonizers and the dark-skinned natives."Oh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet"" wrote Rudyard Kipling in his 1889-first published poem,"The Ballad of East and West". This 1924 novel ofEdward Morgan Forsterclearly illustrated this belief. England being the colonizer and India as the colonized country have two totally different cultures and beliefs. They have different religions, traditions, superstitions and obviously the most members of the fair-skinned race always thinks that they are better than their colonized country that happens to have a darker color of skin (in the novel, some English even called Indians 'niggers').Since Indian independence from British Raj in 1947, does this 1924 novel still have significance to the young people of the world?I was in my late 30's (2000-2004) when I traveled thrice to Mumbai, India. I toured the whole of Mumbai and its neighboring provinces. During one of my trips, I was waiting in the Singapore airport for my plane to India. There was a young female doctor who looked smart and friendly. After some introductions, I learned that she was a medical doctor and she was practicing in London. With my little knowledge of Indian history and being not too culture-sensitive yet, I said out:"Philippines has a lot of English-speaking people and it was because we were under American rule for 40 years. I think India must also feel indebted to British people for bringing good education system in India during their rule". To my surprise, she got upset and replied back:"Please do not credit the British for our educational system. Where do you think the golds of the Royal family came from? Blah blah blah"In 1985, I saw the film adaptation of this novel that was nominated in the Best Picture category in the Oscars. It ended up winning two awards. It did not leave a big impression to me. I think I was too young (fresh from college) then and I had no idea about India's fight for independence in the 20's. Due to my trips to India, I bought the VCD copy of that movie and saw it again. The reason was that I wanted to see Mumbai on the screen again as I saw those tourist attractions featured in the film such as The Gateway to India, Taj Mahal Hotel, etc. Still, the movie did not give much impact to me.Now that I am 45 years old, I read the book where that film was based on. The mesmerizing prose of E. M. Forster not only gave me a deeper insights on the struggle of Indians to gain their independence but it reinforced my personal belief that there is nothing to gain from a country being under the rule of any other (more powerful) country. The reason is that each country has its own culture and beliefs and those being deeply-rooted, cannot be easily shaken off by introducing another culture especially in a short period of time.My only difficulty in reading this book is the lengthy painful-to-read narratives towards the middle trying to develop some of the minor characters. I thought that those secondary characters could be removed from the story without compromising its message. Otherwise, it is a perfect novel with well-developed characters, exotic backdrop, poetic narratives and a resounding message. The fact that E. M. Forster is British made me wonder how could a writer belonging to the oppressor race be able to write as if he was part of the oppressed race?
