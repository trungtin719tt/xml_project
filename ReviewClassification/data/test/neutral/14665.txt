Not gonna lie, I am soooo happy that I can eventually close this book. And by that means I have read it all from the very beginning to the end / every single page of it / not a cowardly DNF. I'm so proud of my self.Thank you.The main problems of this book, that it took me so long to finish it, in my opinion, are:1. The thickness of this book (no wonder Lol)2. The mind-numbing life of high class society that makes the reading felt so repetitious. And also the minority of conflict that leads to a flat emotion of mine.3. The limited romance of the couples, especially between Emma and.... (I can't say it). Well, I don't really mind for this reason. But to be honest, this is where the story got my whole attention. Seriously, why so late and so short?Apart from my objection, with the thickness of the book, I got a much deeper description of the characters as well as the setting. How people interacted at that time and how high class people lived their lives. They liked to hold a party and spent time caring/interfering life of others (it could end up good or bad). And of course, this book gave me a bunch of life lessons and types of people's personalities. It's good. I like Emma Woodhouse and Jane Fairfax, for most part of their personalities. They're both thoughtful women. And of course Mr. Knightley. He's my most favorite character here.So, since I need to relax after gaining my victory over this book, I won't talk about the short story of this book. You can read the blurb on your own. Have fun for you all who plan to read this book or currently reading it. You can do it!
