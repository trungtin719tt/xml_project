So I was reading aCrackedarticle a little while ago. It told me that you get addicted to pop music because it sets off the pleasure centre of your brain. Cracked also told me that your brain derives pleasure from particularly predictable music because your brain enjoys predicting things and enjoys being right even more.Finally, humanity's explanation for NickelbackNo... seriously, look at this:Look at this photographEverytime I do it makes me _________How did our eyes get so redAnd what the hell is on Joey's _________And this is where I grew upI think the present owner fixed it ________I never knew we'd ever went withoutThe second floor is hard for sneaking _________Your welcome, by the way, for all that brain crack I just gave you.Now, despite the fact that that article is only 60% exaggerated bullshit (you must agree, that's fairly good for a Cracked article!) I strongly believe there IS something to that predictablility factor that makes things enjoyable to our brains - which explains about 90% of the YA Paranormal genre.Blue Bloods is brain crack at it's core. Yet I gave it three stars.Vampires? Check.Teenagers? Check.Exclusive vampire school? Check.Danger? Check.Vampire hotty? Well, this gets a merit check for the ATTEMPT at a vampire hotty.Love triangle? Check.This book was painfully corny and the writing wasn't that great.If you've read one YA paranormal then you've pretty much read them all.The only reason this one got 3 stars:1. Because it actually tried hard to have an original storyline/mystery - even if both ended up nonsensical.2. The very end with Jack. That was actually satisfying.Otherwise, keep walking, people. Nothing to see here.
