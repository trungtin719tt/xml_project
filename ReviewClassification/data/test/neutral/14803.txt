3 stars - It was good.What a difficult book to rate! I found this book to be very atmospheric with beautiful passages of quote-worthy prose and really enjoyed the Welsh dialect. BUT, it just felt so incredibly slow for most of the book, and I found the self righteousness of the characters (and of the time) to grow stale and repetitive.It seemed odd that the book began with the main character leaving the valley, yet as the story of his childhood and coming of age unfolds, you never get to the point where he came to the decision to leave the valley. Unfortunately, I never felt fully invested in the characters or engaged in the story which made it difficult to pick back up when there are so many other books whispering my name....A mixed bag, but overall an enjoyable read simply due to the author's poetic way with words and depiction of Wales.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote:The man is made of stone who will see a woman in her tears and keep voice and hands to himself.First Sentence:I am going to pack my two shirts with my other socks and my best suit in the little blue cloth my mother used to tie round her hair when she did the house, and I am going from the Valley.
