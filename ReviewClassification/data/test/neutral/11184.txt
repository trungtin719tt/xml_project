*3.5/5*This was a super fun read, however it definitely reads like it was written for children (which it was). I probably would have ADORED this if I had read it as a kid, but as an adult it just wasn't quite up to my expectations. The world and magic aren't very complex or explained in great detail, and we don't get to know the characters super well, but as a book written for kids it was pretty great! We have a super strong female lead, and I can now understand why this book is a must-read for all young girls.I definitely plan to read the rest of the series though since I've heard this is the weakest of the four! I can look past the weak points because the story is just so darn enjoyable.
