Book Review***contains spoilers***Pros1. Rephaim was finally turned into a human being and OH MY GOD they finally kissed!!! Idk I can't really expressed my emotions about it. I really love that part, aaaaaaaaaawwwwww, it was just so sweet and I cried reading it.2. Heath was back and it was very shocking. I love love love the twist on Heath's character and I really was excited for the next book because of it.3. Kalona can actually go to Stark's body and they're like connected somehow. So okay he found it out when he was actually going to Zoey's soul/mind but what happen was he goes into Stark's. In that moment actually when Kalona do that, Zoey and Stark were like having sex and then OMG it was funny *inserts my uncontrollable laughing here* idk when I read that scene I can't stop laughing. OMG *head desk* honestly the way I imagined it was pretty hilarious like Kalona goes into Stark and Stark was like idk having an"orgasm"*insert my uncontrollable laughing here for the 2nd time* and because of "too much pleasure" the connection broke off *uncontrollable laughing continues*...4. I also love the part when Neferet make an alliance to the white bull. I think it was also a pretty nice twist that I was anticipating for the next books. Idk I felt like it was a bit funny and also a bit "erotic" (or maybe it was just me *wearing my I'm a perv shirt* -kidding-) that Neferet was naked all the time when she was talking to the bull and I find it very shocking that she was naked (repetitive much?) but then she was like riding the bull. That was just deeeeescuuusssstttiiiiinnngggg!Cons1. Too much pop culture references. I was literally pissed off by the constant mention of Glee, Trueblood etc. because I can't relate what the heck are they talking about since I don't watch TV shows anymore. Also I felt like it made the writing lazy and crappy since these conversations were unnecessary, and will not contribute to the plot and character development. It appears to be a waste of pages and also this is just "stereotyping" and the authors violated this rule "Show not tell."2. Grammatical mistakes. I was shocked that I noticed not 1 but 5 grammatical errors though I didn't have the book right now, so I'll mention stuff but I can't put pages on it.-What it is? should be What is it?-They's should be They're-Forgivens should be forgiven3. Zoey and Stark were incredibly horny characters. It was just annoying, actually I could have given this book 5 stars but Zoey Redbird, you just ruined the book for me. Zoey was like this "Okay so Heath died" --mourn for a moment-- and then --she get over it-- and then --she moved on-- and then "I wanna have sex with Stark btw." She's just really idk *head desk*, she's incredibly horny and also have an amazing bad history of sex. First she lost her virginity to Loren Blake who happen to just have sex with her because he was Neferet's lover and he didn't care about Zoey at all but Zoey thought that Loren loves her and blah blah blah *too lazy to elaborate* and then in this book she had sex with Stark and Kalona (as mentioned above, see Pros #3). Btw should I considered that a threesome? Kalona-Zoey-Stark threesome? Whaddya think?4. Horrible dialogues.Zoey- "Bull poopie" and "Hee hee"The queen *who I forgot the name*- awful accent-some lines are cheesy: RephaimxStevie rae, DamienxJack, ZoeyxStarkBut still, still, still will read the next book up until the last book &gt;.&lt; This is guilty pleasure ladies and gentlemen. I'm addicted to it but I admit the books were crappy but I love 'em because they're funny, entertaining and I love Rephaim and Stevie rae's love story. I'm such a sucker for Beauty and the Beast type of love stories. Yeah these two are the sole reason I'm still hangin' up. ^^Short ReviewOkay I think this book is more of a filler and the things happened in this book was like just the beginning of a new conflict to the series. I'd really love to give this one 5 stars but there are just so many things that I really didn't like about it. *sighs*I just wanna say that this one is a classic example of actually a great plot/idea however it was written and executed very poorly. My in depth review tomorrow.Random Babbling before I Read the BookI HAVE NOW IN MY HANDS THE COPY OF THE BOOK*drumrolls*WILL READ AFTER MATCHED________________________________hey guys i just found this book trailer on youtube and I'm seriously freaking out right now.
