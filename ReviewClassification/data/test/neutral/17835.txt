A sensitively imagined portrayal of a small German town in the fateful years between the first and second World Wars narrated from the perspective of an appealing main character who is both of the town in that she is the keeper of their secrets and the source of their gossip, but also other due to her diminutive size, there's a lot to like about this rich and colourful web of life. For me personally it has the added attraction of this fictional town being situated just down the road, the locations ones that I know well. So why did I find myself skipping over huge chunks of it after a while? Well, the writing is plain and straightforward; nothing wrong with that, it's clear and lucid, you don't always want obscurity that makes you work hard, but occasionally it does lapse into history teacher mode....the long training in obedience to elders, government, and church made it difficult-even for those who considered the views of the Nazis dishonourable-to give voice to their misgivings. And so they kept hushed, yielding to each new indignity while they waited for the Nazis and their ideas to go away, but with every compliance they relinquished more of themselves, weakening the texture of the community while the power of the Nazis swelled.It's almost as if Hegi couldn't quite trust her ability to show us this happening and has to resort every now and then to these kind of generalities to make sure we've got the message.And then of course none of the snippets of songs or references to poems and stories have the appeal of the exotic for me, so that may also explain a little of my lack of enthusiasm for what is, actually, a very well-written book. It's a very digestible way of learning a lot about German modern history, but maybe I thought in my intellectual arrogance that I knew it all already.
