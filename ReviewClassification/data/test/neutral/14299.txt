(3.5)This was a wild ride!I've been going through my list of "post-apocalyptic books to read" and this one had been recommend to me so much that I had to read it. Within the last year I read The Stand by Stephen King (disease) and Swan Song by Robert McCammon (nuclear war) so it's impossible for me not to compare them.In The Passage, the apocalypse happens though vampires (not the shiny type!). You get to see the before, during and after through the eyes of a few characters and writing-wise it did remind me a bit of SK.I understand why there's an abridged version - this book is very long and I honestly felt a bit exhausted after reading it. I do recommend it if you're someone that likes character driven books since, while there is quite a bit of action, you get to follow them while they go through a lot.While it wasn't my all time favorite post-apocalyptic book, I am open to reading the rest of the series!Shoutout to the author for making the villain call women "females" and making the male characters think it sounds like he's talking about livestock.Can't wait to hear your thoughts as this was our first buddy read in theFox Book Club!
