I really liked this the first time around, but this time it dragged in places and made me ever so happy when I wrapped it up. Perhaps I have grown beyond the romantic to a book that needs to have some lesser wordiness and more relevance in the modern age. I am pretty bummed that it was not the book I so fondly remembered. Perhaps second readings are not always a good idea, especially for books you were so in love with as a young adult.
