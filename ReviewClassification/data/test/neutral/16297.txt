A Bend in the Roadis a tragedy and a love story. Miles is the police sheriff who also happens to be a young widower. His wife died in a Hit and Run, which he and Jonah (his kid) are still trying to recover from and deal with. When Miles meets Sarah, Jonah's teacher, he starts to think he could find love again. However, not everything is easy for Miles because he's so obsessed with trying to find his wife's killer.. which could somehow put strain on his new and developing relationship with Sarah.This book was okay. I mean, I did get completely hooked by it because it is a Nicholas Sparks book.. and somehow this guy writes complete gold every now and then. It was pretty interesting until Miles go crazy.. and then it got weird (to me at least). Plus, every now and then you got a section or a chapter form the killer.. and the entire time I just wanted to know their name!The relationship between Sarah and Miles was okay. It didn't really blow me away or make me smile like a creepy person. The ending kind of felt rushed to me.. or it just seemed like Miles chose Sarah to make Jonah happier in the end? OR SOMETHING? I don't know.. I'm tired and I need coffee!!Overall, I liked the book. I guess I had higher expectations or just wanted more than what I got from this book. I'm glad that I read it. I wonder if I can read all of his books this year?? On to the next one!
