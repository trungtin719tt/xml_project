While competently written and quite entertaining, Beach Music tries to be too many books in one. I didn't think the various aspects of the story resonated with each other enough to belong in the same book. I felt that Conroy could have written three tighter novels with the material he packed into this one loose one. For example, the long backstory about Lucy's childhood, while interesting, could have been shortened considerably or left to the imagination. It was enough to know she wasn't "of good breeding" and had gone to great lengths to compensate. The Great Jew's childhood story also seemed to belong in another book, as well. All these separate characters' stories gave the novel the feeling of a series of vignettes instead of a tightly wound together whole. For me, the novel was all over the place. A better writer would have either cut some of it out or done a better job of weaving it all together.That said, there were certainly parts of the novel that sang. They could have stood alone as short stories. One such part was the episode when Jack and his best friends get lost at sea as teenagers. Another was the chapter in which Lucy teaches Leah how to dig up the Loggerhead Turtle eggs and re-bury them in safer territory. Unfortunately, as I stated above, each of these vignettes could have belonged in different novels or been published as short stories.Lastly, I want to remark on one major irritant in this novel: the too-snappy dialogue. Jack's often ascerbic banter with his childhood friends when they re-encounter each other in Italy and in S. Carolina comes off contrived and movie-dialoguish. He always seems to have the perfect wiseacre come-back for every situation, and I found it rang false. A less posturing, more self-effacing and insecure Jack McCall would have seemed more realistic. No one is ever on such a witty roll every time they speak.
