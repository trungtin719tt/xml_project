Promises are not meant to be broken. They are like a glass, they are fragile that one you commit a mistake it will break into little tiny pieces and you must pay for the consequences you have made. After rescuingEthanfrom the land ofNevernever,Meghanmust pay for the promise she made from the winter prince. She doesn't have a choice but to leave the mortal world and be withAshin a very cold and dark place,Tir Na Nog.But when your mortal enemy back and steal a very valuable item that increases the power of the season kingdom, everything is in chaos even in the mortal world. The balance had been broke andMeghanhas to chase the thief and put it back to the true owner or everyone will die in a very strange way. CanMeghansave the world before everyone dies or she'll die in the hands of the enemies?I don't usually read books in public transit or if I'm travelling but I have to finish this book as soon as possible and I came up with the idea that I'll read the book while travelling for hours. Accidentally, the public train spurt water and I was shock when I saw the book I borrowed from my friend got wet. I don't know what to do and it affects my reading experience completely. I felt so sorry to the owner that I want to change the book with a new one.How come I came up with three stars since I love the first and the novella beforeThe Iron Daughter? I was so shock when I read some parts that are too annoying in my part as a guy. I can't imagine she have to include scenes like make-over, shopping and so on. She's spying but the story's predicament is satisfying the female scene than emphasizing the spying. I don't like to mention where, but seriously it was a no-no for me. After that, I don't know if I have to continue the other books or I'll wait until next year.I also manage to escape my fantasies and I can't connect after reading it again. It was like I'm asking myself if where this story goes. Exactly that she is mixing fairy tales from the book and the fact that her characters' names are very different from the appearance itself. One example is the creature smuggler which was named as Sweet-something and he looks scary and an ogre with that name.Holler!But the name is cute and sweet but not exactly suited to the characters.It means that the book is really for girls, but I object to the fact that this book is written for girls it must be for both sexes. It was just the second book is more girly than the first one, no, I mean, I can't exactly explain it because I have this feelings that the book will be getting better soon like putting more action, gory, or twists that will struggle readers in the end. I keep on reading but it seems that I can't connect to the book. It was like calling someone and the receiver keep on hanging the phone. You want to punch her but you can't and you keep on dialing it until you get annoyed.I also don't like the love or the romance betweenAshandMeghan. She was so immature; she keeps on begging forAshand keeps on crying like a baby. I though she will become more mature in the book after rescuingEthanin theNeverneverbut no, she becomes more childish than before. I also read some reviews and fans keep on smuggling information about the love triangle, and I can't feel it in the story. If people will ask me, what is your least favorite from the series, I won't hesitate to answerThe Iron Daughter. I just can't accept thatKagawabroke my heart after all I've done.Review posted onthe day that the mighty one will create something surprising.Rating:The Iron Daughter (Iron Fey #2)by Julie Kagawa,3 SweetsChallenges:Book #252 for 2011
