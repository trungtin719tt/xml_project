Shute makes some interesting narrative choices which lessen the dramatic tension rather than increase it. Nearly everything that happens in the novel is telegraphed from the beginning. We know the radiation is headed south and will arrive in September. We are led to believe everyone, all the characters Shute creates and everyone else living on earth, will die,(view spoiler)[ and they do(hide spoiler)]. The only real tension comes on theScorpion's journey to Seattle: what's going on with those Morse code signals being received in the southern hemisphere?(view spoiler)[ Yet this plotline is resolved without incident.(hide spoiler)]Then at the end, intriguingly,(view spoiler)[ Peter Holmes stays mostly healthy as his wife and baby succumb to radiation sickness. He even secretly stores beef sandwiches in the trunk of his car and sneaks away to eat them as Mary wanes, her appetite gone. This seems to signal Peter's willingness to live. Shute could have taken this somewhere interesting, and left Peter alive at the end, but instead Peter commits suicide along with Mary and the baby. It's more utopian than dystopian for this family.(hide spoiler)]A world that humans, knowingly, kill off. What could be more relevant today? In Shute's novel the great powers, along with some smaller ones, bomb each other into oblivion. It's all over in a matter of months. Half of the globe is dead and the other half knows its fate. In our case, it will probably take a few centuries to kill ourselves off with the warming part of climate change. But we seem just as determined to do it.
