This is the first Jodi Picoult book that I have read. I admit that she is a good writer and I found myself unable to put the book down; however, I felt that there was a lot lacking to make this a solid GOOD book. In my opinion, though this book was supposed to be a drama/love story, it severely lacked drama. I felt it was worthy of three stars rather than two solely because I completely fell in love with the main character, Chris Harte. He was the only character that I felt was well-developed and the least bit interesting. If every man could be like this 18-year-old boy, the world would be a much better place. On the opposite side of the spectrum I found myself abhorring his girlfriend, Emily Gold, with her mother, Melanie, taking a close second.The basic plot of this book was two children, Chris Harte and Emily Gold, growing up together as neighbors and best friends. They were inseparable and starting dating around the age of 15 and 14, respectively. By the age of 17, Emily was dead and Chris was on trial for her murder due to an apparent suicide pact gone awry. The trial that takes up at least half the book and then there's a predictable ending. The only true thing that kept me interested in this book was the fact that every other chapter told an account of the past, explaining the circumstances that lead us to this suicide pact (I was curious!).There were a few glaring problems with this book, at least for me. There were several issues that were touched upon, but then never resolved or explained. At times, I felt that the maturity of Chris and Emily's relationship was extremely unbelievable. Most importantly, I felt that Chris and Emily were not a good couple. Chris is obviously a very caring, devoted and sensitive boy. He was completely in love with Emily. Emily, on the other hand, turns out to be weak and completely self-centered. She doesn't even consider how ending her life will affect other people. Though her issues were legitimate, I don't think that she was deeply scarred enough, nor was her situation grave enough to feel that suicide is her only way out. I feel that she needed a good thrashing to snap out of her funk and realize that the world does not revolve around her. Heck, I probably would have shot her as well.Overall, it's not a bad read, as Jodi Picoult is an excellent writer. It is entertaining, though somewhat under-developed. It's not a book that upon finishing I find myself wishing that I had those two days of my life back; however, if her other books following the same vein of this one, I will quickly retire from reading her work.
