2.5 starsI would rate Jennifer Niven's author note five stars if I could. We need more books about mental illness; authors should strive to tackle uncomfortable subjects like abuse, suicide, and bipolar disorder. While Niven's intentions come across as meaningful and good, her delivery through her first YA novel,All the Bright Places, falls short. Some reasons why:1: These characters have QftSoQ (Quirkiness for the Sake of Quirkiness) syndrome.They - in particular, Finch - read as caricatures that spout literary references and send each other uncouth Facebook messages for the sake of evoking our inner John Green fans. I get that teens have intelligent and/or odd personalities. But slapping a character with an unusual sense of self does not do them justice: quirkiness does not equal depth. I wanted to get deeper into Finch and Violet, to learn about their backgrounds, their familial relationships, and other aspects of their humanities.2: Finch and Violet's relationship felt like a shock of insta-love followed by a series of stalker-like advances. I wish I could see why they clicked, aside from their magical first time together on the rooftop of their school. Finch likes Violet's smile and creates a Facebook account just to add her; he pressures her to reveal her secrets and to hang out with him even after she says no. he bases his entire sense of self-worth on her existence, which acts as a huge red flag in any type of relationship. Niven treats this unbalanced romance as if it should make our hearts soar. I wish we got more complexity from Finch and Violet as individuals, in particular Violet, whose grief storyline felt overshadowed by Finch's perspective.3: The parts of the book that pertained to mental illness lacked precision.I appreciated Finch's honesty with his suffering, even if sometimes Niven's voice superseded his own. I also enjoyed the ending of the book and how Niven handled the climax of the story. But so much ofAll the Bright Placesfelt more like an indie romance - starring Violet as the Manic Pixie Dream Girl - than an actual novel with serious themes. Niven could have replaced more of the too-overt symbolism and adolescent hyper-intellectualism with scenes that might have layered Finch and Violet as individuals, because people in real life go through similar struggles, and they deserve accurate representation.As someone who has a lot of personal experience and exposure to mental illness, I wanted more from this book. Other authors have pulled it off, like Michael Thomas Ford inSuicide Notesand Nancy Werlin'sThe Rules of Survival. While Niven writes well and possesses great motives, I hope that readers will recognize the problematic portions of this book and still appreciate its foray into the subject of mental health.
