Winnie the Pooh is wandering around outside the beautiful church of St Martin-in-the-Fields disconsolately. He appears slightly lost. Just a few yards away, perched on the low wall which surrounds Trafalgar Square, a smartly dressed woman is singing sweetly :Feed the bear, tuppence a bagTuppence... tuppence... tuppence a bagTwo small children wander up to her."Please Miss, we want to feed the bear"She smiles at the little girl. "Very well, she says. She takes their tuppence and gives them a small brown bag. They scamper over to Winnie who looks up expectantly. The little girl opens the bag and offers some of the contents to the small bear. "Why, what have we here?" he says, and joy begins to suffuse his whole face. "Honey cakes!" He scoffs them up, making slurping and mmm-mmm noises. The children empty the bag at his feet. "Oh, see how he likes the honey cakes!" says the girl. But then the bear suddenly slumps onto one knee, clutching at his gut. "Oh my", he says, "I do believe I am beginning to feel a little.... queer." Within thirty seconds he's convulsing silently on the cold pavement, lips writhing, already beyond the power of speech. The children know nothing about cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Their faces crumpling in dismay and horror and beginning to cry, they take to their heels. By the time their footsteps have died away the bear has stopped moving, his blackening tongue protruding, his features twisted into a grimace, black frosted bile matting his neck fur.Mary steps across Trafalgar Square to peer at the dead bear. "Now, I don't know about you, but I would say that the medicine has gone down. Indubitably." She winks at a pigeon, adjusts her hat, checks her watch and marches away.**Note to all relevant parties : This book made me laugh and cry. I absolutely fell in love with the characters!
