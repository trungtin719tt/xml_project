I wanted to likeWill Grayson, Will Graysoneven though going into it I didn't have high expectations. Despite adoring John Green from the tips of his poof down to his mismatched argyle socks, none of his books have ever been life changing for me. The only work of David Levithan's I've ever read wasNaomi and Ely's No Kiss Listand I didn't love it. It was erradic, like something written after waking up from drug induced dreams.Will Grayson, Will Graysonwas not a lot better. I don't think either author is completely at fault here. They're both equally at fault. It didn't feel like they pushed each other to new literary heights so much as encouraged each other's worst flaws.Quirk. John Green rains down quirk. Unfortunately, when all the characters are incredibly quirky it's no longer cute. It's exhausting. Most of the characters we come across in John Green's books are blatant non-conformists, so much so that you'd think every teenager was a bit like Lady Gaga, wearing plastic bubbles to school so people will understand they are unique individuals who just don't give a fuck. Maybe it's because his first bookLooking for Alaskawas part autobiographical, or maybe it was before he really got a chance to develop this particular habit, but it happens to be the best in the lot.All the characters created on John's side of the story ooze quirky out of their pores and yet somehow they still manage to be completely boring. Jane memorizes other people's locker combinations just in case, Tiny is putting on a gigantic play about himself, and Will Grayson One is having an existential crisis of sorts -- largely bought on by how much Tiny pays attention to him.I've said this before in reviews. I don't dig weird grammar things. It stylistic, I get it. You're edgy, I get it. I just don't like reading weird lower cap IM conversations. I needed to be drunk to read it, Mr. Levithan. It started off with just a glass of wine and then two-thirds of the bottle later I was able to appreciate some of your wittier lines. Of course, by that point I also thought my coat rack was pretty charming.I will give you this though, what Maura did to Levithan's Will broke my heart a bit. An entire person, a person he let his world revolve around, just vanished and it was all because of this girl's cruelty. So many of his hopes were centered around Issac, a boy he met online who turns out not to exist at all. The cruelty necessary do that to someone else -- the complete and utter lack of empathy with which Maura told him really gave me some of strongest feelings I got from the book, a sad fact since I liked Levithan's Will a lot less in general.I don't think Levithan's Will was particularly nice to Maura in the gearing up to that process, but I definitely don't think anyone deserved what she did. He's this guarded teenage boy with a lot of issues and she made him trust and depend on her pseudo alter ego. Given his personality she really could have been inciting a school shooting or other violence.Tiny Cooper made the first half of the book sort of unbearable for me and then how his relationship with Levithan's Will made the second half of the book difficult for me. I know I sound impossible to please here. Ugh. I wanted less of him, but after they gave me so much it annoyed me with how things played out with him and Will. I felt like Will ended up with Gideon because Gideon was thin. I didn't see much of a connection between the two of them. Will came out of the closet and Gideon appeared, never to leave again but never to really develop himself either. After all the mental cracks Will makes about Tiny's weight I couldn't help but think David Levithan was too much of a Gary Stu master to let his paper extension end up with someone that heavy.Best line:"NO. No no no. I don't want to screw you. I just love you. When did who you want to screw become the whole game? Since when is the person you want to screw the only person you get to love? It's so stupid, Tiny! I mean, Jesus, who even gives a fuck about sex?! People act like it's the most important thing humans do, but come on. How can our sentient fucking lives revolve around something slugs can do. I mean, who you want to screw and whether you screw them? Those are important questions, I guess. But they're not that important. You know what's important? Who would you die for? Who do you wake up at five forty-five in the morning for even though you don't even know why he needs you? Whose drunken nose would you pick?!"Relationship I liked the most? None of the romances. Not Will2/Tiny or Will1/Jane. Not Will1/Will2. It was Will1/Tiny. Their relationship was complicated and difficult. They drove each other insane and undervalued one another. They loved each other. It was genuine and complicated. Yeah, Tiny wasn't a very good friend to Will1 through a lot of the story and Will1 was horrible at expressing how he felt, but it felt like the most genuine thing in the book. My best friend, who will probably read this, routinely drives me insane. She has long streaks of forgetting she's six months younger than me, not six years. I have a long history of not sharing how I'm feeling until I'm screaming at the top of my lungs. I love her anyway. Not having her as part of my life wouldn't work without a lot of therapy. What Will Grayson1 said about them being together too long to question it now and wanting his kids to play with Tiny's kids... well, not all soulmates are the person you marry.What really ruined the book for me was the grand finale which came across like every high school movie ever. I felt like the multiple Will Graysons couldn't possibly be summoned that quickly and one of them being Tiny's exact type? Please stop spoon feeding me bullshit, guys.Overall it was an okay book, but please, John, a little less quirk next time. Maybe only one character wears the red shoes every day instead of them all doing it in their own unique, magical way.
