(Actual Rating:3.5 stars)The honest truth: coming into readingThe Golden Lily, I remembered next to nothing of what had transpired in the first book,Bloodlines. I had some vague recollections of things Adrian had said (because, come on, who can forget what Adrian says?), the climax, and the scene where Adrian remarked about Sydney's eyes being like "molten gold." At first, I thought, "Oh, it's just you; the first book couldn't have been that unmemorable" -- but, after readingThe Golden Lily, I'm not so certain.On the one hand, I understand: in terms of plot arcs,Bloodlinesis proving to be a tamer beast thanVampire Academy. Though both series have their instances of romantic drama and tension, theBloodlinesseries really does have a more flippant air, what with the setting (California) and focus on "lighter" affairs (high school, dating, modeling, etc.). Though I could excuse such things inBloodlinesas a "start-up book" to the series, I honestly expected more plot tension, danger, and immediacy inThe Golden Lily. To my dismay, I didn't feel that I received any of those things.I once read somewhere that, if a writer doesn't enjoy what he/she is writing, then the reader will fail to enjoy it as well -- and I think that's part of the problem withThe Golden Lily. There are sparks of life and enjoyment in certain scenes (such as interactions between Sydney and Adrian), yet then that verve dissipates into a dullness over the course of much of the book. If I were a betting woman, I would place my money on the belief that Mead really didn't enjoy writing most of this novel. It's a wonder she didn't somehow have all the characters thrown out of their Californian setting and shipped off back to Court, to the heart of the intrigues and danger involved with Moroi politics and Strigoi attacks, because -- honestly -- the new setting and "focus" really don't seem to be serving the story (or characters) as well as they should.As much as I loved the growth of companionship between Sydney and Adrian within this installment, I will be the first to admit thatrelationship-building and romantic tension alone do not a good book make.They help, of course (especially if you latch onto good characters and their relationships as I do), but there needs to be a strong plot supporting them. Not all of the Sydney-Adrian scenes in this book were directly related back to the plot or its roots; rather, many of the scenes occurred for the simple function of building a bond between the two. That's not reprehensible, no, but it's disappointing, especially given that a few of theVampire Academynovels really managed to strike a balance with characterization, relationship-building, and plot. With all that being said, I still enjoyed the Sydney-Adrian moments scattered across the book, but I wish that their presence hadn't been at the expense of suspense, mystery, and danger within the plot.Sadly, another weakness ofThe Golden Lilyis that Sydney proves to be a detached narrator, even more so than I noticed inBloodlines. As much as I like her as a character (really, she's been a favorite of mine since she first appeared inBlood Promise), her narrative in this installment lacked vibrance, and -- perhaps most detrimental of all -- she really didn't seem to have much of an interest in the people around her. Even despite some considerable character growth for Sydney betweenBloodlinesand this installment, the only interactions where she really seems to come to life are with Adrian, and even those could be explained away by the fact that the two are the most obvious "couple-to-be" in the series. Everyone else seems throwaway and inconsequential -- a stark contrast to how side-characters were treated in the earlier installments ofVampire Academy. We never get a sense that these characters are continuing to move, breathe, and interact when they're "off-stage" (i.e. not within Sydney's sight and thought process). Rather, it sometimes feels that the characters are mechanism-driven puppets that cease functioning if they aren't related to Sydney or the plot at hand -- and that's a shame since Jill, Eddie, Angeline, and Trey really should be more than just tools or props within the story.Another minor issue is that I'm a bit disappointed that this series is branching off into common paranormal intrigues with vampire hunters and witches added into the mix. Even though innovation can be injected into such groups by way of an author's execution, the way Mead tackles them feels tired. If only the vampire hunters and the witches seemed as intriguing to me as the Moroi and the dhampirs did when I first started readingVampire Academyyears ago.As disjointed as my thoughts on this novel seem, I guess they can be all chalked down to this: I'm disillusioned by theBloodlinesseries thus far. Iwantto love these books even as I devour them, but they're rather like not having a full meal: after the fact, I feel hungry for something I didn't receive. No doubtThe Golden Lilyleft me with some moments where I smiled or laughed, but overall my experience was ultimately unsatisfying. Hopefully, the third book,The Indigo Spell, will bring back some more of the storytelling I remember and miss from theVampire Academydays.
