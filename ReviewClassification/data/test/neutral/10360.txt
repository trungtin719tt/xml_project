I remember the first time I watched "The Da Vinci Code" and how much it scared me. I seriously hated it but after 2006 things changed for me. What I found interesting before changed. I become kind of obsessed with cults, religions, believes, signs and many other things. So I watched the movie on TV and I loved it, and now I'm a fan and can't wait for the other movies to come.I bought "Angels and Demons" and I'm moving quickly in it. The information are interesting but not all are correct regarding Islam. But it's fiction so I'm eating it up. But I find that I don't like Robert Langdon in the book, I prefer Tom Hanks portrayal in the movies, and I liked the changes made in the movies. I prefer the thriller without the romance, and I prefer them without mentioning us or linking us to Illuminati and I like the changes made to the other characters and events.I read this book about seven times because I keep researching the terms, locations, and everything I don't know, that sometimes I lose touch with the actual story. I really HATE how much the author keep insulting and demeaning Arabs, Arabic language and Muslims, but I think the author is anti religion in general now.What's so interesting to me right now, is the science mentioned in the book, it's what interested me most. I'm enchanted by the jet that took an hour from USA to Switzerland, I'm intrigued by the center in Switzerland, it made me wish that I was into science, or that I was a scientist... I love the idea of that place, I'm currently following them on Twitter. CERN is the one that invented the internet we are all obsessed with, the idea that they think it's not their "best" work makes me so curious about what else they invent and do. I would like to read a book about their work and what they are working on.I think Vittoria Vetra's father was such an amazing guy. Also, is there a full list of the books in the vatican library?
