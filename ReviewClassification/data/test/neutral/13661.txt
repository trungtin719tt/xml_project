Me too, Britney. Me too.I think I suffered from high expectations on this one. I thought we were going to get all this new information about their relationship and I didn't feel like that happened. I felt like a lot of the conversations were the same almost verbatim but with pronouns changed.I understand I will probably be in the minority on this and would appreciate people not jumping on me. :)I will say, that the epilogue completely saved me and I had a huge smile on my face when I finished. Oh, and I LOVE that my favorite line stayed in this one, "WELL I BELONG TO YOU!".
