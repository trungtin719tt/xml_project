I enjoyed this, and I feel almost bad giving it three stars instead of two, but there were a few things that bugged me enough that I just had to. There has been a nuclear holocaust (seems to be the theme of my reading lately) and we see the aftermath through the eyes of what eventually become two main groups. Simply put, the good guys and the bad guys.Almost every review I've seen compares this toThe StandbyStephen Kingand there's a good reason for that. In The Stand it's a disease that brings about the end of civilization as we know it, but really that's the main difference. I know a lot of fans of this book say the similarities end there because in this the world is decimated. There is little life, no sun, little fresh water, etc. but that isn't belabored. McCammon dwells on these things so little that when the sun comes out at the end I wondered why it was such a big deal until I remembered it had been pretty dark all along.One of the issues I had with this are just how bad the bad guys are. I mean bat shit crazy, wackadoodle nut jobs. The bad guys almost always are, but there were almost ridiculously so here. In the end, when given a chance to leave, only three men leave the evil camp for the good. Three out of thousands. We're talking universally bad, not just following a leader for food, security and some semblance of a tribe. Just evil.Very near the beginning two "magical" pieces are introduced as plot anchors, but by the time the story is finished one is gone with little fanfare and the other has done very little except look pretty and give a few dreams. There is a hint of more power in this particular talisman, but McCammon doesn't explore this. I felt almost as if he were setting the stage for a sequel or follow up novel.After griping for the last few paragraphs I feel I need to say I did actually enjoy the novel. It felt clumsy at times and very far-fetched, but it was compelling. I generally have no problem suspending disbelief, but when characters developed growths on their faces I could see where it was going because of the broad brush strokes he used to paint the two opposing sides. When it finally happens it felt almost cheezy, but again, it was still a compelling read.I think this book was a bit like Hamburger Helper. Is it gourmet or refined? Hell no, but it fills you up and you eat it guiltily despite how bad it is. It eventually satisfies and sometimes that's all we need. Satisfaction.
