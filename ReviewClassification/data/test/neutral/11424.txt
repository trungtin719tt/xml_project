WICKED is good.Nah.Where should I begin? Firstly, this was by no means as good as the first book. The first book was a mix of thrill and adventure and the mystery surrounding everything was something that gave the chills.On the other hand, the second novel failed to give me the goosebumps and I would sometimes lose interest. The storyline felt dragged on and phase two was a boiled potato. I felt like Mr. Dashner put all the characters and had them running around like pigs for nothing. It kind of got on my nerves and frustrated the hell out of me.The only reason I gave this 3 stars is because it finally picked up on the last 70 pages or so and more happened in those pages than the rest of the book. Although, I still feel baffled and the mystery has gotten old.The characters, well, they're an add to the story. I love Mihno, Newt and Thomas, when he is not complaining. I love their conversations and I really laugh with them and their Glader words.The Betrayal plot might appeal to you, the author managed to pull that off nicely and managed to distance two characters, completely.The ending? Confusing as hell. I mean alright, I love me some tight cliffhanger but this one was a bit too baffling for me to handle. Why does Mr. Dashner want to perplex the storyline even more? I want to get down to the core of it and I want to finally find out what it is they're doing all those things for.
