[7/10]- "What's on the other side of the door for me?" Eddie asked the gunslinger quietly. "Go on and tell me. If you can tell me, maybe I'll come. But if you lie, I'll know."- "Probably death", the gunslinger said. "But before that happens, I don't think you'll be bored. I want you to join me on a quest. Of course, all will probably end in death - death for the four of us in a strange place. But if we should win through ..." His eyes gleamed. "If we win through, Eddie, you'll see something beyond all the beliefs of all your dreams."- "What thing?"- "The Dark Tower."I wasn't bored, but neither was I exactly bowled over by this sequel to 'The Gunslinger'. The book is eminently readable, the tension maintained with consummate skill, the new characters intriguing and well fleshed out, the dialogues snappy and natural. There's even a couple of well rendered high adrenaline shotouts, some scary oversized lobster-monsters that justify the classification of 'western-horror-fantasy' for the series. What I'm still missing is the point of the quest. Why is Roland compelled to search for the Dark Tower? When will the blank spots in his backstory be filled out? When will we learn more about the world of Roland, why and how it moved on? Questions that remain largely unanswered at the end of the novel, making it a second, longer prologue to the main event that is still only vaguely defined, mostly in metaphysical terms. I want to see something 'beyond the beliefs of all my dreams', but so far I got a lot of posturing and marketing sales pitches, promises of later enchantment, if I only continue reading these Gunslinger books. I guess I will do it, I will give credit to Stephen King's promises and to the enthusiasm of his legion of fans, even as I cast a wary eye at the doorstopper size of these later installments.Coming back to the present story, the plot is holding together much better than the episodic novellas included in the opening book. Roland needs some sidekicks to aid him in his quest to reach the Dark Tower, and some unknown entity or God is conveniently placing doors to the north of the beach that our gunslinger finishes his westward quest after The Man in Black. These doors lead to a parallel universe, a secondary world that is revelaed to be our own dear Earth, in particular New York City. The doors also mess up with the fabric of time, and Roland goes through the portals into three different timelines: 1987, 1964, 1977. I had to check online for the dates, I'm not sure they are spelled out like this in the book, but maybe a reader more familiar with American pop culture will have an easier task than me in placing the action correctly. I know that the sixties in particular are a fascinating, defining moment for King, as references to the Kennedys, Rosa Parks, Martin Luther King and the drug counter-culture are recurrent themes in King's stories.Anyway, the dates are less important to me than the people Roland is trying to recruit. I believe this is the one field where King is a true master : making the reader care and become invested in the fate of his fictional characters. The first door gets us into the mind of Eddie Dean, a young man in very big trouble, a drug addict that gets on the wrong side of a Sicilian dealer who uses Eddie's love for his older brother to turn him into a drug smuggler. King manages to transform this crook into a smart, loyal, considerate knight, a reluctant participant in the search for the Dark Tower that I hope will serve later as a counterweight to the more ruthless, cynical atitude that drives Roland."Only two choices here, Roland whispers. Don't know how it is in your world, but only two choices here. Stand and maybe live, or die on your knees with your head down and the stink of your own armpits in your nose. Nothing ..." He hacks out a cough. "Nothing to me."Being a newcomer to the world of Roland (a blank slate), this Eddie Dean would make a useful literary device to let the reader learn more about this still generic country and about the backstory of our gunslinger. This opportunity is mostly wasted for now, as roland is very reluctant to release said information, and when he does he talks mostly in riddles. For example, Eddie wants to know what is 'ka' and why it is so important to Roland?Here it means duty, or destiny, or, in the vulgate, a place you must go.I may be thick skulled, but in another part of the novel 'ka' is equated with Roland's soul or conscience, the part of him that goes through the doors and leaves his physical body behind. So I'm still confused, as I am about the nature of the Dark Tower (a nexus of time and space, I believe was the description in the first book).Second door gives us an even more troubled character, a woman of colour with a split personality. Odetta Holmes is a rich Park Avenue heiress with a sweet disposition and an active interest in the civil rights movement. But she has recurrent headaches that leave blank spots in her memory. She is completely unaware of her alter ego, Detta Walker, a bitter, violent, foul-mouthed, paranoic virago from the ghetto. Odetta/Detta is also a double amputee, victim of a random act of violence. Again, King is in top form making the transitions between the two aspects of this schizophrenic personality, using both women to advance the plot and crank up the adrenaline and even managing to introduce a romantic angle into his epic.By the time we reach the third and last door prophesized by the Man in Black, the pace of the story has become a headlong rush into action, with split second cinematic cuts that grab the reader and refuse to let go before the last page is turned, no matter how late into the night it gets. The third 'recruit' comes to us like the previous two with a heavy psychological bagage, probably the heaviest, since his Tarot symbol is Death. Jack Mort is a socipath, a serial killer that we find out has already messed up with the fate of Roland and the others. How could he possibly be destined to be part of the search for the Tower? Well, you must read the book if you want to find out, it's not my place to give away all the salient points.To finish with my review, after praising the characterization and the pacing of the story, I feel I have to include also the part that is bothering me. It has to do with free-will and pre-destination, with the use of prophecy and convenient plot devices (doors) that appear out of thin air. The construction so far feels contrived, forced, and still too vague.(view spoiler)[ In matters of the Tower, fate became a thing as merciful as the lighter which has saved his life and as painful as the fire the miracle had ignited. Like the wheels of the oncoming train, it followed a course both logical and crushingly brutal, a course against which only steel and sweetness could stand.(hide spoiler)]. So, is Roland a rebel against the forces of entropy/destiny as he likes to refer to himself, or a puppett on a string for a cruel and mysterious master? I don't know, but I am probably going to read the next book in the series hoping for some illumination.I wil say good-bye with a last example of Stephen King sneaky, yet effective marketing, a final repartee between Eddie and Roland:- Are you going to get all of us killed? [...]- We all die in time, the gunslinger said. It's not just the world that moves on. But we will be magnificent.
