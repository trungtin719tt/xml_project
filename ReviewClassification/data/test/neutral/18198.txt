There are so many layers toBrave New World. One aspect that is often overlooked is its exploration of what it means to be human, and how far humanity can be stretched and altered before basic humanness disappears. I think this is why the book still resonates today -- even though the methods have changed, we are still using technology to play with the idea of humanness, whether it be computers, genetic engineering or something else. The book raises questions about the interplay of science and technology with power and social engineering. Huxley both reveres and fears science, he welcomes its advances and comfort it brings, and fears the unintended consequences of its application, and science that has no reference to a system of ethics. Then there are the questions of sex and love and happiness and suffering and how a person can function both as an individual and a member of a society, and whether the two are even possible.The novel itself is only half a novel -- it is really more a place to hang ideas on, and all the characters function as authorial ciphers. The plot is superficial, a mere way to explore the world Huxley has created and all its strange and terrifying consequences. But it's still compelling, funny and bizarre to read; I still wanted to keep turning the pages.Brave New World Revisitedis less interesting, but still fascinating as a piece of paleofuturism -- a forecast from the 1950s about what the world would look like today. It is interesting how much Huxley got right, and how much he got wrong. Many of the issues he was concerned with no longer trouble us, but others are just as relevant today as they were when he wrote it.I was unimpressed with the introduction in this edition, written by Christopher Hitchens. His ideas were confused, he was clearly pushing his own agenda rather than introducing us to the work, and ultimately I feel he just didn't understand Huxley or his novel. Disappointing.
