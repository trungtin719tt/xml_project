I've really got to stop reading a book just based on the title and cover. I love the sea and the beach. During the fall and winter I go sea glass hunting North of Boston. It's my second passion to books. My house is filled with all types of sea shells and different shades of sea glass. My husband tells me I should make jewelry when I give up my current job.I've got to say this book is quite outdated. It's all about women and their place in society. I don't need someone to tell me that females need to seek solitude. I love solitude and wish I had more of it. When my husband says do I mind if he goes out with the folks from work after hours I'm like go! Have fun!This book sounds like something my mother would have wrote. She hated to be alone. I could never understand that. Who wants to be around people all the time? A walk on the beach with the seagulls overhead, the sun on your back, and the sand in your toes is what it's all about for me.Gift From the Sea is a shorty so no big deal. But I sure didn't expect it to be like Dear Abby!3 out of 5 stars (kindly).
