I don't think any author is in love with her characters and her own writing as much asDiana Gabaldon. To the point that she is convinced thatabsolutely everythingshe writes about themhasto be in her books. Who cares about the plot and moving things along and putting in her novels only events that would advance the plot? Not Diana!I've loved theOutlanderbooks for a while, in spite of their fragmented nature and sometimes convoluted story lines, but this time even the most dedicated fan would notice thatThere is hardly any plot in it!I am still trying to figure out what the purpose of this book was, my only guess is to lead to the confrontation with Stephen Bonnet? But then, hundreds and hundreds of pages inThe Fiery Crossare dedicated to the events that have nothing to do with the main story line of it. At least 2/3th of the novel could have been cut out because the only thing that happens there is that Jamie, Claire and Roger have to go on some militia business and then come back (twice!). During these trips nothing important takes place, except, of course, they meet some random people. And don't get me started on Brianna's breasts. If all the bits about her breasts being swollen or leaking milk and her wanting Roger to suckle on them were taken out,The Fiery Crosswould have been at least 100 pages lighter. And another 100 pages lighter without little Jemmie pooping in a diaper or otherwise.Certainly, we, fans, have a fair amount of patience for Gabaldon's long books and a lot of love for the characters and scenes in their lives, but, come on, a novel is still a novel. If there is hardly any forward motion in the story, no danger, no intensity, if you can skip hundreds of pages without missing anything vital, and the author is preoccupied with indulgently recording every occurrence in her characters' lives, important or not, she might as well call her work fanfiction. Or a soap opera with no end in sight.Interestingly enough, even after spendinga year!readingThe Fiery Crossand dropping it so many times I can't count, I still couldn't bring myself to give it less than 3 stars and I already have the next book in the series loaded onto my iPod. This crack has a firm hold on me. For now.
