Since I don't really have time and don't want to write a detailed review, I'll just say a few things...1. I didn't really like this book as much as some of Sparks' other novels. I'm not sure why...2. I would give this book three and a half stars, still, because it was still good.3. One thing that really bugs me is that i almost feel like Sparks thinks he needs to write an explicit sex scene to sell something. Out of all his books that I know of, A Walk To Remember is his only one thr doesn't. You don't need sex to be in love. And especially not in such detail. But I guess some people like it.4. Another thing I'm rather tired of is that his characters seem to fall in love after only a few days! That'd not enough to build a relationship on! Don't get me wrong, I still love his novels. That's just not realistic.Well, that's just in my humble opinion, which everyone is entitled to. I'm sure that some of you have different opinions, and I'd love to hear how you feel!Oh, a P.S. to those of you who dislike Sparks' books because they don't have "happy endings": get over it. It's life. Not everything is always roses and weddings, okay?
