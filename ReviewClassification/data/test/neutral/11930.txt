In the end, I wound up liking this book, but it was a long (so, so long) and bumpy road to get there. Somehow, this book is written by the same author who managed to pack an epic fantasy adventure into 800 pages with the original Outlander. Yet 1500 pages were needed here to... to do what? I don't even know. There's more than a couple sweet scenes between Jamie and Claire, but in between it's a wasteland. Over and over, characters are described as hiding a smile or having the corner of their mouth twitch in amusement. The every action of a toddler including the contents of his diaper are described. Jamie &amp; Co. march around the woods a bit and then they go home. They go to River Run and then they go home. Rinse and repeat. Fascinating.Despite creating an ever growing cast of characters, this book focuses on the nuclear core of Jamie, Claire, Brianna and Roger. Ian has reason to be absent, but I don't know what happened to Fergus and Lord John. Then there's the mystery Gabaldon seems to shoehorn in her books of late. I get that the author started out wanting to write mysteries, but it's seriously time to reconsider. The second half of the book is improved over the first, especially the last 200 pages. But, overall, it lacks anything resembling a plot and contributes very little to the larger story arch of the series.It takes a pretty devoted fan of the series to appreciate this book, and, even then, I'm not sure how necessary it is. Here's to hoping things get better with book #6.
