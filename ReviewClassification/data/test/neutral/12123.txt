Read as part ofThe Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.I'm not a huge fan of genreless fiction, not in the least when it has a strong romance-vibe, but I foundThe Shell Seekersto be a pleasant read. It was not at all taxing and can be described as escapist literature, and requires not an awful lot of mental agility to get through, but that was part of its charm.The best thing about the book was how splendidly well it was written. I wasn't hugely captivated by the plot, in fact, I thought it was rather weak and there were about 200 superfluous pages, with some extremely tedious moments during the mid-way section that meant I had to put it down for a few days and return to after a short break; having said that, it was a lovely journey to go on and I found myself transported to the wonderful places that the characters inhabited.Speaking of which, I though Penelope was such a wonderful, breath-of-fresh-air character. It's a rare thing in books these days to have a wonderful, strong, independent older woman as a main character in any kind of medium (be it books, film or TV) and I enjoyed her immensely. The other characters were a little bit too background for me, though I enjoyed them as they were, and found they all fit in with each other well.It is not a book to change lives, it is simply something to read and enjoy. I did enjoy it, despite my misgivings, though it won't be read again, nor perhaps will it be much thought of ever. But I thoroughly enjoyed reading something that was so well-written and just lovely to get around to.Blog|Instagram
