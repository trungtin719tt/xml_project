Peller picks an intriguing way to bring his "To Live" trilogy to a close. Shawn Michals has migrated to an island, and is living out his life in solitude. This changes when Bina, a mystery semi-femme fatale, seeks him out. The island is in political and religious turmoil, and Bina, with the use of social media and outright seduction, basically thrusts Shawn into the role of a Presidential candidate. During the chaos of his campaign (guided by Bina and her political party known as "The Acceptance") he learns a lot about himself, encounters mysterious characters (particularly one who runs one of a chain of establishments known as "fantasyLAnds" where people come to explore fantasies within themselves they can't consciously reach. He also has to confront aspects of his past (being a part of a rigged sport known as "fazzball"). Eventually he is captured and tortured by the Island's ruling party, who want him to betray Bina and The Acceptance. In the admittedly thrilling climax Shawn is led to a place called the Blessed Rise (the edge of the volcano that erupted centuries ago and gave birth to the Island). There he gives an inspiring speech to the people of the Island, fully expecting he will be killed by the ruling party immediately after he is through speaking. Instead he is rescued, and elected President of the island. He is also gifted with a child at the end, courtesy of Bina. This book is a bit of a departure from the other two "To Live" books, and I'm certainly going to have to read it again to absorb it fully. But it made me think, and that's what counts.
