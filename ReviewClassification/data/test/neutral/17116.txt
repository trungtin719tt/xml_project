Amusing and yes, these are stupid tales. They are silly and not what you expect. The winners and losers change places. I do like Chickin Lickin'. Cute name. Maybe, back in 1992, this was more surprising than it is now, I can't remember. It's interesting.My nephew had me read it and he enjoyed the book and laughed when he was supposed to. The Stinky Cheese man was his favorite. He knew that it was like the Gingerbread man. He had fun.I did like how the narrator broke into several of the stories to make a through link.
