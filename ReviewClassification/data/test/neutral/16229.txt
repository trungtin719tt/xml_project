Video review islinked here.Okay, Sarah, you finally got one right. I enjoyed this book and it was a quick read that helped me escape all the upheaval in my life right now. I liked Auden and her arc, I loved Eli and the friends that Auden made. Heck I even loved Hollie even as I hated Auden's actual parents. It was a fun summer read and for once didn't have anything problematic in it that stood out to me.
