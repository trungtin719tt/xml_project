This started out good, but the pace really killed it.Nora was both strong and weak in this book. Strong because she was intent on finding a way to please both the angels and the Nephilim, and weak because she ended up with a bit of a drug addiction.The storyline in this was about Nora trying to fulfil her oath to lead the Nephilim, whilst still dating Patch, and trying to keep that a secret. The pace in this was really slow, and while it was good in places, the pace really killed it for me, and I got a bit bored.The ending to this was okay, although I was really bored by that point.6.5 out of 10
