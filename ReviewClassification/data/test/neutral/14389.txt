3.5 stars.I liked this story. having seen the tv show first, then read the book once I was old enough, I found it a very accurate, picture of the place and time. Be forewarned, it can come across as depressing, and in my humble opinion, the story line was better in the tv series.There was a bit of graphic material and depressing things in this movie as well as one or two scenes that were a bit out of place and inappropriate. recommended for 16+ because of mature content.
