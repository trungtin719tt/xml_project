Just kill someone!ConclusionContinuing the Series:YesRecommending:SureShort Review:(view spoiler)[ Why have Jason marry Cyrstal if she was gonna fuck it up 2 books later, and that punishment?! WTF. Breaking fingers! And freaking Sookie did it, wtf Jason, you coward(hide spoiler)]I find it weird to have Eric actually remember what went on between him and Sookie. Sookie already told him so what's the point of him remembering and bringing it up again. And why the fuck would Sookie break up with someone because they have some slight baggage!?! Ugh. This is why you will probably die alone Sookie. The little Were battle needed to stretch out more. I am eager to learn more about this King thou. Fun stuff.Misc.Book Boyfriend:Dawson!Best Friend Material:Bob!
