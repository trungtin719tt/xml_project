2.5 StarsDo you want answers? Finally? Have you pressed through so many u!words to find some sense of meaning? Too bad.I originally almost dnfed the first book because I wasn't getting answers. I know, I know. That's the point sometimes, your not supposed to know stuff. Knowing this, I pressed onward. I expected answers in this book.But No!! We get no answers!! None! Come on, Dashner! You're driving me crazy!!!!!I'm not sure if I'll read the prequel or not.Bottom Line:2.5 Stars: Just as confusing as the first two.. No answers at allAge Recommendation: 13+ (Violence, Brief Kissing)P.S. The ending sentence... They say that WICKED is good... But is it? No!
