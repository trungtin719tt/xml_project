I've spent the past few years writing a book on Inferno, immersing myself in Dante's Commedia, and was looking forward to a fun read. While the book is decent it's still a disappointment. Despite having quite a few issues with Da Vinci Code, it was nevertheless a fun trip through the world of art and puzzle solving. Unfortunately Inferno reads more like a movie treatment with some factoids thrown in. At times it reminded me of the old Batman episodes with the caped crusader pulling off an implausible escape from the bad guys every 5 minutes.On the plus side, Brown does give Dante a pretty good treatment for the reader not familiar with the Commedia. I also enjoyed the whirlwind tour of the city (having visited Florence last year). Inferno continues to follow Brown's style of page-turning, very short chapters and I have to admit I got sucked in.On the minus side, the book is replete with the usual anti-Catholic bigotry (although not as bad as Da Vinci Code). And of course, there's the writing. Brown's writing isn't as bad as some of the critics say (including some readers of this site), but Brown certainly isn't writing literary fiction either.I'm not a Brown hater, but I have to wonder what Dante's Inferno would have looked like in the hands of Umberto Eco.Afterlife: An Introduction to Dante's Inferno
