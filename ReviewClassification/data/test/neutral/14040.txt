Better than Bloodlines, and yet still only as good as the last Vampire Academy book, in my opinion.Sydney: much less annoying than in the previous book, but her issues are so predictably and rather clumsily written that it's hard to get attached to her. Still, she has a couple of decent, non-mousy scenes towards the end.Jill: seriously, just let a hunter have her.Adrian: some redeeming scenes here and there, but not nearly as attractive or as intriguing as he was in VA. It's disappointing that one of my favorite (formerly) crush-worthy boys has become so sullen and uninteresting.Onto book three next year! Hopefully it's the last one in this series, though. This trilogy already seems to be stretched pretty thinly, even though the books are decently sized.
