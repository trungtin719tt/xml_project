Glass-eyed, marbled prison stare,Functionless form that with willWould coldly rend limb from limb.Toothy gates, e'er sealed againstWhat would gnash and tear, stronglyAflow with the crimson bloodOf a savaged savage god.Dooby, dooby, do.No exit, the maze.The jazz, it plays.Dress yes, no stays.Eat meat, greens graze.Tunnel-tied dust interludes abound.Fat girl wrangled.Grandpa mangled.Outside dangled.Inside strangled.Such are the days when the spring winds down.
