Finally, I have the right word for this predicament: When a capable author uses her prowess to create a work whose sole purpose seems to be to depress the reader, it can be described asFrome. This word can also be used as a verb, noun, adjective (Frome-ish, Frome-ier, etc), adverb (Frome-ly), etc. to similarly describe the effect it has on the reader, (ie, "I was Fromed.")An example used in a sentence may be: "John Steinbeckwas clearly suffering from a touch of the Frome when he pennedThe Pearl"Or, "Can we go see a rom-com? These foreign films are beautiful but leave me feeling Fromey."
