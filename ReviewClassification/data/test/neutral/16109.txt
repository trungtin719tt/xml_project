Notes from BookCrossing: Just finished this one. I was going to clean in my office a bit and then finish it up tonight, but with the stalker in it, I decided to read it while it was light out, as my husband is out of town :)I wasn't sure what to expect, as I saw the movie "Message in a Bottle" (hated it), the previews for "The Notebook" (but haven't read the book or seen the movie yet), saw "A Walk to Remember" (liked it, but it was slow and almost too sweet), and I have "Nights in Rodanthe" in the pile of books to be read.I didn't have any pre-conceived notions about this one, so thought it might be a good light one to read while my book club is going throughCatch-22. Problem is we just started that (read the first 10 chapters for yesterday's meeting), and I've already finished this. Guess I'll have to find something else. . .Anyway, I liked this, in a odd romance/mystery novel sort of way. I actually liked it better when I read the author's notes at the end where he mentions having always wanted to write a book about a dog :)The characters were pretty believable and I found myself really caring for them, even if the story was fairly predictable from almost the first chapter.The best part was the description in the prologue, of how Julie felt after losing her husband. It was so totally accurate, I know the author has either lost someone close to him, or asked someone who has how it feels:If people asked how she was doing, she simply shrrugged. But sometimes, just sometimes, she had the urge to answer.You want to know what it was like to lose my husband?she wanted to ask.Here's what it's like. Jim's dead, and now that he's gone, I feel like I'm dead, too.Is that, Julie wondered, what people wanted to hear? Or did they want platitudes?I'll be okay. It's hard, but I'll make it through this. Thank you for asking.She could do the brave soldier routine, she supposed, but she never had. It was both easier and more honest to simply shrug and say nothing.This is a good, quick read.
