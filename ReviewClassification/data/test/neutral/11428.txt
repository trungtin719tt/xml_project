Okay firstMockingjayand now this? What is going on? I honestly can't even put into words what I felt so lacking in this installment, but I just felt so bored the entire time. Where the first book was so insanely mysterious and really baited you along in finding out what was going on, I feel like I don't want to know what's going on anymore.What seems to be really going on is getting SO annoying. WICKED is evil. But then they save Thomas. But then they get his girlfriend to curb stomp his head in. Then they save them in the end. Then they betray them again. EXACTLY like the ending of book one. It just felt so repetitive by the end, and Thomas's endless "Oh Teresa I love you, wait I hate you, wait where's Brenda I miss her" became grating on my nerves.I don't even feel like overlaying the plot. It gives away way too much way too soon, you know exactly where they are and where they need to go very early on, losing that first book mystery and charm within 100 pages.I wanted to love this. You guys know thatThe Maze Runnerholds a special place in my dystopian heart. I just.. can't. It evolves on the overall mystery, but I just feel that there isn't much to find out anymore. We know Thomas and Teresa helped WICKED out. They want to know why. Um.. because they're trying to save the world? Isn't that obvious? Yeah the methods are unorthodox, I just wanted to kinda yell at the characters sometimes at how idiotic they sounded.And there's just not enough answers (that I also feel may NEVER get answered, for some reason). Like what the hell were those metal balls that decapitated people? Or that room that Teresa threw Tom in in that cave that gassed him to health? Or those creatures lacking mouths, eyes, ears and any orifices, but with glowing orange bulbs all over their body? I almost feel like I want answers less to the big questions, but more to these really really odd occurrences.And then there's the new Group B of girls that we learn have to kill Thomas. But change their mind. And a new kid Aris (who was with Group B in their Maze) seems to be touchy-touchy with Teresa. But turns out they really... aren't. I think. And Thomas and the Gladers group up with Brenda and Jorge, Cranks they met in a huge old city and who help them along. But Brenda turns out to be a mind reader/talker person, too. So that means I can't trust her anymore? I... guess.TO MUCH, man. It bordered on contradictory most of the time and hit frustrating all the time.Let's hopeThe Death Curehelps me fall back in love with the series. I have this hunch that they're gonna throw them back in the Maze. Or a new Maze. I dunno. It's probably me just wanting to go back there, it was so brilliantly realized and it's own character. The Scorch, on the other hand, besides creepy lightning storms... *yawn*
