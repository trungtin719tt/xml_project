It could have been much better and with more pages to contain much story content but Nope.The book is actually like a short story. Jen seems good to me and on number #8 on the scale of #10 what most guys would like to have as their partner. However, the Barett IV seems to be the typical American child, from, be it '60s, '70s, or Now. Same as that of Holden Caulfield but bit more educated.The whole story went with very few changes around and nothing much so different as expected. However, being short in words I found it good enough to cover so fast and with ease because of its easy language, as well.To not giving it so hype as it had so far;For me it deserves: 3.0/5.0
