Is anyone else so freaking excited for this book?! Why does it take him so long to write though? It's torture.I have so many predictions about what's going to happen, I couldn't list them all here if I wanted to. But the main ones are:- Eragon ends up with Arya... I don't really like her but it would be kinda weird if Christopher Paolini threw in a new girl he falls in love with, in the last book.- Murtagh is going to end up being good! He's going to change his name and get free from Galbatorix and end up marrying Nasuada. You know it's going to happen.- Roran might become the new king *shrugs* He has the leadership skills and is really determined.- Arya is probably going to be the new dragon rider *sigh* I don't really like this but it's probably going to happen. Then he dragon can mate with Saphira and Arya and Eragon can be together.
