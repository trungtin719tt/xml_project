Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea is an iconic work of science fiction, and I think all the beautiful, detailed descriptions in this book about life on and under the seas make it even more fascinating. However, I found that, at least in the edition I read, some aspects of the book are both outdated and offensive, which I regretted.I rated this book with 3,5 out of 5 stars.
