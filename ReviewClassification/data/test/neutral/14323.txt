If you've seen Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED, then you are familiar with the setting of this book. A poor, predominately white neighborhood (in Boston) where (male) children grow up to be either criminals or cops. Violence is a part of life, and the vicious cycles of abuse and crime are never ending.Jimmy, Sean, and Dave grew up together. When they are 11-years-old, a "cop" car pulls up and busts them for fighting in the street. Sean and Jimmy, the tougher ones, lie and avoid getting in the car. Dave, the weak link, goes off with the "cops." Of course, they weren't cops at all, but pedophiles cruising around looking for their next victim.Everyone thinks Dave is dead, never to be seen again. But he is a clever little boy, and escapes the pedophiles. Reunited with his family after being gone four whole days, Dave spends the rest of his life wondering if should ever have come back. No one treats him the same, either refusing to talk about what happened to him or taunting him, calling him "faggot" and bringing up his "ordeal" as often as possible in order to make his life a living hell.From then on he's marked. He's no longer Dave, he's the kid who was kidnapped and raped, and everyone thinks he'll become a pedophile too.Dave valiantly fights against all this. He becomes a great baseball player, moves away, gets married, has a son named Michael, and tries to live a normal life. But he can never escape his past. Every time he sees someone from the old neighborhood he knows they are looking at him intensely. Looking for the slightest sign of damage.Jimmy, on the other hand, was a successful criminal mastermind for many years until his associate squealed on him and he was put away. While in prison, his wife Marita raised their daughter Katie. But after more than a year and a half in prison, Marita develops skin cancer and dies in a matter of months. When Jimmy gets out of the slam he finds it's just his daughter - Katie, age 5, a stranger to him - and him against the world. He does his best to be a good father to Katie. He goes straight, runs a corner store, gets re-married to Annabeth, has two more daughters. He puts his life of crime behind him.Sean, the last of the trio, takes the high road and becomes a cop. His marriage is in shambles, his wife only calling him from God-knows-where and not saying anything. He's desperate for her to come home, even though she's pregnant with another man's child.These three men, once childhood best friends, are now living in separate worlds. But a violent, gruesome murder brings them all together again.Katie, Jimmy's 19-year-old daughter and the person he loves most in the world, is found dead in the park with two gunshot wounds and also beaten severely.Who did this? Why? Who will find the guilty one first - the cops? Or Jimmy, the ex-criminal father bent on revenge and twisted by grief?With suspicious characters and threads of possibilities strung through every chapter, Lehane weaves a wonderfully complex mystery that will leave you guessing until the very end.I liked the character development in this novel. Lehane does an amazing job of putting you right in the middle of these people's lives. I really felt like these characters were 3D, living, breathing people. They were complex and fleshed-out. Lehane's dialogue was also realistic and fast-paced without being unrealistically clever. He also did a great job of leaving the reader wondering who-did-it until the very end. I liked the tough-as-nails, take-no-shit female characters who were the backbone of the neighborhood and fiercely protective of their men and their children.I didn't like how depressing this novel was. It was pretty grim, with a bad outcome for a majority of the characters. It left me feeling grimy and depressed, and that's not what I want from a book. Also, I didn't understand why(view spoiler)[ Celeste betrayed Dave - and to Jimmy of all people. Why did she do that? It didn't make much sense to me.(hide spoiler)]All in all, a good mystery book. It's a little dark for my tastes, but still good - because Lehane doesn't get into descriptions of torture, or rape, or killing. All that stuff happens "off-page" and I really appreciate that. SO MUCH. However, the book is still pretty grim - one message being "you can't escape your fate" and showing how violence and abuse cycle endlessly through generations and generations, despite a person's best efforts at change and redemption.
