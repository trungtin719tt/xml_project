Having read this book, I'm scrambling to try to compare the first two ones, and to understand why I rated this book a three, while at the same time I enjoyed reading it on a basic level. The twists in this book are no better than those in The Gunslinger.However the world they are set in make the difference. The Gunslinger made the cut as the better of the two because its characters, I realize, are given more time to shape. Here the people in our world are not the equal of the man in the desert, or of the priestess, or of the woman who slept with Roland. Here though, was a big question. How was the third person going to end up?I was surprised how he died. I thought Roland needed Mort. In the end though, it all comes to taste. The book is good enough for me to hope for better. Now that's a contradiction, but that's how it is.
