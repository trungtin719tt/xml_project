I think it can go undisputed how misogynistic this is, but in a way, its ability to anger me was impressing? Idk. The content sucked, but I think it sucked for a reason. I don't think Shakespeare hates women and thinks they're inferior to men, yet I wish this had more of a comeback arc. I loved when Katharina was sassy and angry and at the end of the book she ended up so subdued, and I was waiting for her to snap back, but she never did. I'm disappointed.
