Still very entertaining, but I was disappointed by her adding creatures from another dimension that could become invisible. It was a bit too much for me. The parts could have been handled by other supernatural creatures without going so far afield. It went too far beyond the scope of the world she's created without a good reason.Also, the setup by the Fellowship was too transparent &amp; unrealistic. The security lapses were just too gross &amp; the scheme was ludicrous.I did like finding out more about Quinn &amp; the other character development. It wasn't a bad story, but certainly not one of her best. I'm hoping book 8 will be better.
