My first completed novel for the #BookTubeAThon!My thoughts on this book are simple:- I enjoyed it, but I don't think it comes close to matching how great Uglies was- The plot in the last around 100 pages was exciting, but the first 2/3rds of this book dragged and felt all-together unnecessary- The novel felt repetitive and redundant at several points- I feel like it's suffering from middle-book-syndromeI did enjoy it, like I said, but it just didn't capture me like the first one. I will definitely be reading the next novel, and have a feeling it will be very action packed!
