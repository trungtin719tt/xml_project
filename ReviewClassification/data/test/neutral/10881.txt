This was a re-read and I own a physical copy of the entire series!DISCLAIMER: I loved Puddleglum!On the other hand, The Silver Chair didn't quite live up to my expectations. It follows Eustace from the previous book in the series and a classmate called Jill. To escape a group of bullies, they venture outside of their school and arrive back into the world of Narnia. Their quest is to save a Prince from impending danger! Although I enjoyed the world-building, I found the pacing to be quite slow and the story-line not as gripping as I thought it would be. Not my favourite from the series.
