The job of the partners is to find a female patient/murderer who has disappeared, while also having the unfortunate timing of having to battle a hurricane simultaneously. What the duo initially came to investigate and what they actually end up discovering are VERY different things.I readShutter Islandwaaaaaaaay back in May, but failed to ever write a reviewbecause I SUCK at keeping upbecause I feel like Dennis Lehane should never get lower than 4 Stars. Lehane's writing is so above-par that giving him a measly 3 seems blasphemous.However, it's a 3 I must give. I actually never even knewShutter Islandwas a movie until I brought this library book home (I like to stick to only raunchy comedies and B-grade horrors for my viewing pleasure, apparently) and my husband told me how good it was. And it was good . . . but not great. Although the writing once again was stellar, I kneweverythingthat was going to happen - and that's pretty unforgiveable to me when it comes to giving a high rating for a mystery/thriller. At some point therehasto be some unexpected twists and turns, and that just wasn't the case withShutter Island. (FYI - I'm also one of "those people" who ruined "The Sixth Sense" for all when I immediately knew the ending - and shouted it out becauseno onewould have believe me if I hadn't - so if you're not good at figuring out what's up, you might be blown out of the water with this one.)I've still never bothered to watch the movie, and although I'm sure the book is better - because seriously the book is almost ALWAYS better (excludingYOU, Forrest Gump!!!) - I have a feeling Leonardo DiCaprio doesn't disappoint. Heck, just browsing through the various .gifs had me knowingexactlywhich part of the book the scene was from, andthatis VERY cool.
