Read as part ofThe Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.Nicholas Urfe, an Oxford graduate post-war, with no direction and a slight hint of nymphomania, travels to Greece to work as an English teacher on the remote island of Phraxos, mostly to get away from an Australian girl he shagged but doesn't love and wants to ditch.Unsurprisingly, the remoteness is boring and he is drawn to browsing the island, where he finds an even more remote house in which lives Conchis, the titular character whom holds all the mystery that Nicholas desires.There's not a lot else one can say without giving it away, but the mystery deepens and we fall in to a trap alongside Nicholas of quite mixed proportions. The beginning ofThe Magusis one of most fantastic and tantalising beginnings in literature (certainly that I've read) and, even with reading crime fiction on a regular basis, I've never been kept so in the dark and felt the need to know what happens next. There were so many surprises in the first half of the book that what happens next makes anger rise rapidly.The descent of this book over a cliff is an understatement. I want to admit that, although one could never call this book even remotely nice to women (or homosexuals or black men), it is-not excusable-but explainable by the era it was written in. When women were shits because men said they were. I never really cared much about the treatment or behaviour of the women, no matter how much anyone says that feminism is a woman enjoying sex, so we'll leave that out of this.What I did care about was the banality of the reveal, the incomprehensible shiteness of the plot outcome. The sheer let down that such a wonderful, mysterious opening began but soon left behind as if it were another book in another dimension on another plane, tucked neatly-and resolutely-under a rock. First person narrative is always tricky and I'd never consider myself a fan, but in this case the irregular, unreliable narrator of Nicholas was welcome and necessary. One cannot have omniscience with someone playing god.One can say that, perhaps, at the time it was written it was a good book. With a good shock, a nice little fight against the prude nature of Victorian Classics like most Modern Classics seem to be. I enjoyed the contrast, but ultimately I think it took it's course too far and, as I said before, fell off the cliff without a rope.Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Pinterest|Shop|Etsy
