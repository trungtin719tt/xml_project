I'm not entirely sure why I read this entire series. Certainly the writing sometimes left something to be desired and eventually the plot became so ridiculously beaten, abused and tormented that I briefly considered starting a home for it and marketing telethons help others like it.I think the only thing that saved this ENTIRE series for me was the relationship between Bones and Cat. Passionate, loving, flawed, sometimes almost breakable, realistic. I don't know and since I had to turn my brain off to read this last installment, it's hard to get it going again.So, read this series at your own risk. I don't necessarily endorse it but if you're looking for brainless sexy times then line up and at least give it a go.
