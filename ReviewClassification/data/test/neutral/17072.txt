DNF @ p116Real Rating: 2.5* of fiveI just can't. I don't like reading about straight people having sex. So that's why I don't wanna go on...I know your sensitivity to this unpleasant reality is different, but this issue increasingly makes a book unreadable to me. I am not straight, I didn't like straight sex very much when I was having it, and I am just not willing to compromise my remaining reading time with overlooking stuff not aimed at my pleasure centers.
