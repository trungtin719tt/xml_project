This is a really interesting yet flawed collection of short stories.I don't have much to say about this volume, as a matter of fact. The fact that there are dozens of short stories collected here makes it hard for me to review. I think that Borges is at his best when he is combining great prose with interesting ideas, but there are some times when the ideas are less than interesting and the prose is less than great. I'll add that he is not at all the sort of writer who makes an effort to get the reader into the characters' minds.I'll give a single example here to illustrate the point. One of Borges' most famous, and one of his best stories, is "The Library of Babel." The idea is that there is a library that contains books with every single conceivable combination of words, punctuation, etc. The story is basically an exploration of this idea: are there books that say virtually the same thing as each other? Are there books that will accurately predict the future? What about the future of our particular lives? Is there "my" book waiting out there for me to find? If so, what are the chances that I'd find it?If these sorts of ideas intrigue you, especially when paired with such compelling great, I urge you to pick up this collection. That being said, notice what I omitted: characters. That's right: there are no characters in "The Library of Babel." It's just a story about the library, and some reports of how humans have interacted with it. I recommend this volume to anyone to whom such stories seem attractive.
