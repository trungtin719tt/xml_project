"Men are incomprehensible assholes," I said to Amelia."No shit," she said. "When I was searching for Bob today, I found a female cat in the woods with kittens. And guess what? They were all black-and-white."I really had no idea what to say...Why did this crack me up? Bob is Amelia's boyfriend that she accidentally turned in to a cat.I swear, baby, it's not what it looks like!So, there are a lot of different storylines going on in this book, but no romance at all. That was kind of refreshing. Sookie breaks up with Quinn for probably the stupidest reason on Earth, but that just clears the way for Eric, or Boring Bill who is trying to win her back, in the next book. She also meets her fairy great grandfather, but that also feels like a set-up for a future story. And, she gets involved in both Were and Vamp politics - again. It almost felt like a transition book that was clearing the way for the next story. But, it was still entertaining enough. Sookie herself doesn't seem to grow-up much in these books. She is still dumb and self-absorbed. I would hope for a little more growth after 8 books. But, whatever....
