Books were very hard to get into at first, I'll admit. The books drag a lot in the beginning. In the first novel, I nearly put it down until I got the part where he introduced Lisbeth. Then it got interesting. In the second book, it started out the same way as the first; slow pacing and lots of unneeded detail to the personal lives of the characters, like Lisbeth apartment-searching, shopping, etc. I actually put the book down for a couple of weeks before picking it up again. Then BAM - I hit the middle and then it starts to get interesting, via the twist. I actually haven't finished reading the third, but overall, Lisbeth Salander has to be one of the most interesting female characters I've ever read. She doesn't take mess from anyone and if any one of the characters screw her over - which happens a multitude of times over the duration of the series, hence the first book's original title in Swedish, 'Men Who Hate Women' - watch out. There's also a ton of violence and sexual content. The writing leaves much to be desired (which is understandable, considering the author handed the books over to the publisher before dying, leaving the books unedited), but if you're up for a fluffy, twisting thriller, these books are it.
