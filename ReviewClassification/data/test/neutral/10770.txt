Everything you've heard about I Am Legend is true: it's scary, the way Matheson conveys Neville's descent into madness is brilliant, the post-apocalyptic world is well-crafted, none of the movies inspired by it do it justice ... and the whole thing feels very dated. This isn't to say that it isn't enjoyable, but if your friends have built this up like it's one of the greatest stories ever told, I'd adjust your expectations quite a bit. It is a great story, an in an historical context, it's pretty impressive and important - it was one of the first times (maybethefirst time) a medical explanation was given for vampirism - but it feels like it was written in the 1950s, which may not go over very well with some readers.The volume I read contained some of Matheson's other stories, in addition to I Am Legend, which was a pretty quick read at 170 pages. A couple are real standouts: Buried Talents, The Near Departed, Prey, and Witch War were great, and if the book had just stopped with them, I would have given it 4 or even 5 stars.Ultimately, though, this book is too long, and it overstays its welcome. Matheson has a very distinctive voice, and as much as I enjoyed his storytelling, by the time I got to The Mad House (a story that I would have loved if it was half as long) I'd had enough, and I put it back on the shelf without reading the last few stories.
