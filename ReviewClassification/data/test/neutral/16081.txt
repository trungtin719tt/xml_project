I enjoyed this new take on Beauty and the Beast. It was definitely an easy read, I finished this 300-page book within about 3 hours. The message about inside and outside beauty is a good one for young teens. I don't really think this book would have been very interesting for older teens, 10-13 year-olds is a target audience.Having said that, this was an uneven book. It started very strong, but fizzled a little by the end. It just became a bit too simplistic and cheesy and the lessons learned in the beginning lost their value.Beastly is recommended by Amazon along with Unwind and Hunger Games. Unfortunately, Beastly has a long way to go to reach the quality of these two excellent YA books.
