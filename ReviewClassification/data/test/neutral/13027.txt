It's nice that a story written at the height of cold war tensions 52 years ago still manages to be relevant. This is a post apocalyptic story mostly set in an abbey in the southwestern United States, hundreds of years after a nuclear holocaust. That event becomes a sort of mythology for the times as the church tells the story of "the ancients" (us) in the form of a parable about the "Princes" of the world being given these weapons in the hope that mutually assured destruction would be enough of a deterrent. Except of course, each ruler thinks that if they strike quick enough while the other is asleep, they can control the Earth. We know how that ends. "Such was the folly of princes, and there followed the Flame Deluge."Canticle is divided up into 3 books that take place thousands of years apart. The one variable that doesn't change is the Abbey. It's responsible for protecting the "Memorabilia", which are artifacts from the previous age that the church is safeguarding for a time when man is "ready" again. You see, after the holocaust, mankind finds itself in a new dark age where technology is non existant and the majority of the population is illiterate and preyed upon by bandits (think Mad Max or The Road). The Church once again becomes an important institution set on the preservation of the little literature, science, and culture that remains from our age. Seeing the monks try to decipher what blueprints are and what fallout was ( they thought it was a demon since there were shelters to protect people from it) really amusing. Most of that deciphering occurs in Book 1 "Fiat Homo" which was my favorite of the 3. Its a really nice introduction that is surprisingly humerous for such a dark subject in a dark time. I laughed outloud at Brother Francis of Utah at his expense several times.I'm not a religious man, but I found it so refreshing to see the Church preserving science and having such a positive role in the future instead of having both those institutions be antagonists all the time. That's been done ad nauseaum in science fiction in my opinion.Book 2 "Fiat Lux was good, but not as good as Book 1. This takes place in a sort of enlightenment era, where science is finally starting to gain traction once again. It's the little steps towards that end that make Fiat Lux enjoyable. If the world were plunged into darkness today, how many of us would really be able to get a good old lightbulb up and running from scratch?Book 3 is the most "sci fi" of the three in that it takes place in the year 3781. It's in that last book that I think the book gets a bit derailed as Miller decides to toss in a good old fashioned euthanasia debate and some sort of two headed mutant with a little immaculate conception thrown in for good measure. Also the absurdity that Miller thougth we'd be communicating via radiograms and using microfilm made me a chuckle a little bit although I quickly stopped myself becauseits so impossible to try and predict the future with any semblance of accuracy. Book 3 however, is where Canticle delivers its devastating knock out punch that is probably the single reason this book is still held to such high regard and still discussed well outside of the science fiction circle. Is mankind doomed because of its nature? Can we escape the consequences of George Santayana's famous quote of those who can't remember the past, being condemmed to repeat it?It's a very cerebral book where not alot of action really takes place, but I really enjoyed the ideas and never had a problem picking it up. It's funny at times, heartbreaking, provacative, and has moments of quiet reflection.I'll conclude with a quote from the exhasparated future abbot Dom Jethras Zerchi:"What is the fundamental irritant, the essence of the tension? Political philosophies? Economics? Population pressure? Disparity of culture and creed? Ask a dozen experts, get a dozen answers. Is the species congenitaly insane?"
