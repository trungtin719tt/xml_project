It is not hard to like this book. The writing is stylish. Four POVs with two different settings and starts way back from the Second World War to the present. This is basically a love story between two young lovers in Poland. They get separated because the father of the girl sends her to America not knowing that she is pregnant with a child. The young boy follows the girl to America only to find out that she is already married and the child does not know that he is the father. So, the poor man,Leo Gurskylives all his life watching his girlfriend,Alma Meriminskiand their sonIsaac Moritzfrom the distance until they both die and Leo has no other reason to live.That's the first POV.The second and third POVs are those of two siblingsAlmaandBird Singerwhose father gives their mother a copy of the book that is written by the old man (first POV) while he is a young man in Poland. The fourth POV is an unnamed narrator telling us that the old man has a friend,Zvi Litvinoffwho becomes the author of the former's book.But I will not tell you how the lives of these 4 narrators or POVs are interwoven or intersect because that is too much of a spoiler. In fact, the slow revelation of the clues or filling up of the blanks is the best deal this book offers. Well, of course, aside from the distinct voices of each narrator that make the reading quite a pleasurable experience.My first personal complaint is that this slow revelation, tease if I may, became dragging and repetitive especially during the second half of the book. So, while on that part, I was asking myself if Krauss had no other things in mind for her characters to do other than to make them wallow in their loneliness. It is too depressing I twice had to check if the author of the book was not Jodi Piccoult. I mean, life is not all about sadness, day-in, day-out, right? Even when my father died in 1997, after a few days, because all of us siblings were in town, we went to a karaoke bar and sang the night away because my US navy brother was about to leave the next day. So, even if my dad was buried just two days ago, we had to give our brother a happy moment to remember during his visit because he only sees us once in every 10 years or so.My second personal complaint is that there is a big similarity between Krauss' style of writing here and that of her husband, Jonathan Safran Foer'sExtremely Loud and Incredibly Closelike the almost empty pages and the young person searching for something. Here that young person is Anna Singer and she is looking for a woman called Alma Meriminski while in Foer's novel it is a young boy looking for the door that can be opened by a key. Had I not read Foer's first, I would have liked this book better. I am not against writing couples to compare notes but I hope they still maintain their own different styles so they don't appear asbuy-one, take-onekind of thing. For example, some characters in the novels of Paul Auster and Siri Hustvedt may have that shade of detective mystery but all the other aspects of their novels are different. I have read 4 books by Auster and 2 by Hustvedt and they are among my favorite living novelists. Well, this is my first Krauss andIncrediblywas my first by Foer and it might be still too early to say but right now, I have no urge of picking my second book by Krauss (unlike when I read my first Hustvedt that the next time I was in a bookstore I bought another book by her and started reading it upon coming back home).Just two small complaints. Overall, I still liked the book and it was worth my money (bargain at $1) and time (9 days of leisurely reading).Thank you to Mae, Rhena and Bennard for reading this book with me. They were very disciplined in following our reading schedule and shared truly insightful daily comments while reading this book. I would not have liked the book if not because of them.
