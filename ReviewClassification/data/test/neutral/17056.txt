Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge: a book with your favorite color in the titleThe beginning was great, as we got to see Watson meet Holmes for the first time, and discover some of his quirky personality traits. We see them jump into a little murder case, and work through that with the police force, which was all awesome. Halfway through the book, it shifts to different characters to sort of explain a bunch of backstory about how Sherlock figured it out, but I found this portion to be tedious and uninteresting, as I just want SHERLOCK. ALL THE TIME. So this was a decent introduction to the characters, but I hope the rest of the books don't follow this format!
