This book was probably one of the first that got me into the YA genre!!So, obviously, with my terrible memory, I'd say I probably remember 30% of it.And that 30% is basically: THIS WAS A REALLY GOOD BOOK. READ IT......NOW. XDThis story is about 4 friends who travel all over the world with this mysterious pair of magical pants. I mean, pants that can make everyone look good?!!I NEED A PAIR, PRONTO.So besides everyone trying to squeeze into these pants, these 'sisters' experience so much crazy shit, like love (duh), boy cooties ;), and friendship problem drama. :)So is this a typical story of life??Sort of..............JUST READ IT.
