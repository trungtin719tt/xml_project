I enjoyed this book but WARNING: Get the novella before you read this. Only reason I gave it 3 stars is because it's VERY CONFUSING and not satisfying to not have read the novella first. Believe me, I did it. Bad idea, shoulda added it to the book I think. Enjoyed it though, the character was very unlike Mercy but still I enjoyed!
