MORE? MORE! @ P.S. I love that book!THE WORLD: So pretty much the same as in the first book. We have our world and then in addition we have these supernatural immortals. Oh and yes we also have Summerland which is basically a place between life and death and where everything you want you can have.CHARACTERS: So main character is named Ever which just for the record I really like. In the first book I really loved Ever but now she became a little bit annoying. Basically, in the second book Ever becomes a very stereotypical teenager which I of course cannot tolerate. But don't worry, it did not get to the point where I could not stand her at all anymore. I have problems with her character but all can be remedied in the future, hopefully. Now you ask me why I find Ever so annoying suddenly? The thing is another evil guy from the past comes and wants to destroy Damen this time. Therefore, Damen starts loosing his memory and basically everybody around Ever too. So she has to make this magic portion to put everything back together before it is too late. And therefore, she starts creaking out and just acting purely stupid at some points. I liked Ever way more when she was rational. But oh well. Okay so obviously the love interest in this book is Damen. Well, did not like him in the first book and that has not changed. Only good thing was that with him losing who he was basically Damen was not much present in the book. Whoop whoop! That is about it. There is also a an evil guy but just like with evil girl in book one they are not really characters but more of the probes. Oh and no more Ever and Riley talking, that I missed greatly.LOVE: It was kinda refreshing having Damen not know Ever. It is like taking a break and I really enjoyed it. But frankly, I really don't care about Ever and Damen relationship. All I care about in this book is Ever herself.PLUS: It had this concept of Summerland which I found rather enjoyable. And well obviously magic.MINUS: It kinda felt like the first book was rewritten with an evil figure concentrating on Damen rather than Ever this time.OVERALL: I think this book had a famous second book syndrome. Therefore, third book of I come.MORE? MORE! @ P.S. I love that book!
