Fast-paced and infused with JLA humor that has since become the norm when I read her books. Felt like the school aspect of the plot was a bit unrealistic (haven't readVampire Academyso not sure if it was an issue in that one too) but I could be a bit biased in boarding school-related settings. Liked the main character, Alex, and Aiden, her teacher-crush. Seth was by far the favorite but he didn't have too many parts in this one. I loved how she shares the same role as Seth and he doesn't get along with Aiden, that should make things very promising for the sequel. As always, I feel like JLA's strength lies in dialogue &amp; romance, her weakness in this book was definitely the action and a bit the overall plot. Will be continuing this series as it is a light, fluffy fantasy read &amp; easy to pick up after a hectic day.
