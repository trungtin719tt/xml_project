Ok, this is 3 books in one and the stars are averaged out. It's YA Vampire/Werewolf/Witch novels, so you know, good stuff. I couldn't stand Poppy in the first one, she annoyed me from the very first mention of her. Her twin Phil is the only reason I kept reading, because she is ANNOYING.The other books were better - MaryLynn was awesome, and while I thought the ending was a little rushed, I appreciated the characters a lot more.The third book was the most balanced in terms of story, and characters I could empathize with on 90% of the level. And so I'm looking forward to how it will be dealt with in the other books which, sadly, are not available on Kindle yet so who knows when I'll read 'em!
