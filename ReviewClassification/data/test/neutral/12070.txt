Fiction can be classified into two broad categories: (1)Escape literature- written purely for entertainment to help us pass the time agreeably and (2)Interpretative Literature- written to broaden and deepen and sharpen our awareness of life. Escape literature takes usawayfrom the real world; it enables us temporarily to forget our troubles. Interpretative literature takes us, through the imagination, deeperintothe real world: it enables us to understand our troubles. Escape literature has pleasure as its only object. Interpretative literature has as its object pleasureplusunderstanding.(Source: Perrines Literature)The reason why I thought I should quote this is to differentiate Haruki Murakami'sKafka on the Shorewith this novel of Paulo Coelho,Veronika Decides to Die.Kafkais more of escape literature whileVeronikais more of interpretative. I said more because at times the other type comes in but if you look at the totality, there is a dominate type.This is my second book by Mr. Coelho and I thought I prefer this than hisThe Alchemist. For me this is more honest as it reflects life as it is. A couple of decades ago, when I was taking my second college degree at DLSU-CSB-CDD, our professor asked us:"Who among you have thought of committing suicide?". Almost everybody raised their hands except me and my friend. The class was composed mostly of young kids from rich families (I was an exception) and it never came into my mind how could these moneyed souls could have thought of taking their own lives.Veronika, a 24-year old main protagonist of this novel, is exactly in the same league as that of my classmates. Yet, she tried killing herself so she had to stay in an asylum,Villete. Reason: boredom. There are other 3 main characters in the novel:Zedka, the diabetic woman who went crazy after she thought that she did not fight for her happiness as a mistress;Mari, the lady lawyer who did not go insane but chose to be live in the asylum to fix her marriage andEduard, another rich kid - only child - who went crazy because of his parents' excessive love and attention.If a novel is an interpretative literature, does it have to be boring? The answer is no.Veronikaoffer a roller coaster of emotions. I laughed out load twice: in that scene when Dr. Igor, the asylum head, talks to Veronika's mother. I almost got teary eyed in the scene when Veronika was supposed to die and she and Eduard went up to the castle. Very moving parts. Saw those inThe Alchemist. I would say, very Coelho.Is there a "pure entertainment" part? Yes, there is a sex part (I did not know that Coelho is also into sex): there is a part when Veronika masturbated in full abandon in front of Eduard. There is also this quote on page 143:"It seemed that everyone, a least once in their life, wanted to take part in an orgy"And Mr. Coelho is not talking of only men but everyone.
