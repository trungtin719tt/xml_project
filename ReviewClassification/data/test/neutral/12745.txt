The autobiography of Helen Keller, written when she was still quite young, as she had just finished college. It is a fascinating thing to even contemplate what a brilliant mind she had despite the obvious obstacles that were set in her way at such an early age. My greatest admiration goes to Miss Sullivan, without whom Helen Keller's mind would undoubtedly remained locked in her disabled body.Miss Keller describes things so vividly it is difficult to remember that she has not seen nor heard any of the things with which she has become acquainted by her senses of touch, taste and smell or her extensive reading. Throughout the reading you simply keep saying to yourself, "what a remarkable woman." Were the subject of this book not so fascinating, I doubt it would hold the interest as acutely as it does. I was amazed at the number of noted people who took an interest and had a direct impact on her life. Alexander Graham Bell being one of the key figures who enabled her to find a way out into the world and help to foster her education.Well worth reading, with a solid 3.5 star rating.
