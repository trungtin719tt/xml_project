*3.5 starsOverall, it was good. I'm quite suprise how much I love this book. Surely, it started with a very slow and almost to the point boring that it took me ages just to reach 100 pages mark. I actually stop reading and watched the movie instead. But l'm glad that it getting more and more interesting after 100 pages mark.I enjoy the day to day task that Andy had to deal with. And Miranda way of bossing and scaring people around her was absolute b***h. But you can't called Miranda evil wears Prada if she was not 'that' evil right.What I love most about this book? The ending! I love how Andy came to realization that being refers as young Miranda is not a compliment. Something that was not to be proud of. And I love how Andy turn the situation around. Yeay!!!
