This is by all accounts from other readers a fine juvenile read. i found it when my children were already grown...adults...on their own, but finding I had enjoyed other "youth reads" I picked it up anyway. I found it nice. It's reader friendly and I think it will stretch and involve younger readers well. If you have younger readers this is one you should try. As a book that holds on over for older readers I don't think it works as well, though if you read it young and loved it that might be another story.I really couldn't get involved in the story, but I wish I'd found itr when my kids were young enough to have it read to them.
