This was my first introduction to Chuck Palahnuik.Hello Chuck.I'm one of your followers on goodreads.I'm not as weird as any of your characters but maybe one day you'll not write about self-help groups and instead will write about online book groups.After all bookishness is kind of an addiction too right?Or maybe it's a compulsion?Or a bit of both?Just take a look around goodreads.com...Like facebook for the literate.And immoderate.And insane.I think there's scope.Let me know what you think.A weird place to start given that I probably should have gone for Fight Club, his best loved, most vaunted and money spinning work to date. Anyway, it was a good introduction none the less. Odd, off kilter views of a world which most people never really think about generated out of the random scenario sequence generator:sex addicts + pioneer town historic re-enactment + god complex mum + choking = viable income for main character plus story.Umm I think I just summarised the plot there. Still not entirely convinced how choking in public places generates a decent yearly income though... and is it tax exempt as a donation rather than actual earnings? All I can say is that no matter what the net choke income is per annum, it's probably still more than I earn as an archaeologist!
