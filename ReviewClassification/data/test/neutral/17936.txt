Oh, I wanted to like this so so much, but I did not so do much. As happens far too often the concept is good, in this case a boy journeying into his dads brain to save him.Problem is there is no tension. I mean yes he has to save his dad but the books telegraphs that this will be a happy ending.And the moral is very heavy handed. You need to use both sides of your brain. Yeah, yeah, I got that message.I have it three stars because the writing is actually well written with some bon mots thrown in. I'm sure there are those in the middle school realm who would love Bernard's adventures.I'm hoping the final publication inks in the penciled illustrations.Thanks to Netgalley for making this book available for an honest review.
