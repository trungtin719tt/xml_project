Meh.Well, unfortunately this wasn't the page turnerGone Girlwas for me. The most interesting thing about this book in my opinion was Libby's character. Where Gone Girl started out slow and then got really good, this one started out amazing and then went flat. I do like that Gillian Flynn creates these screwed up characters and I found Libby to be somewhat entertaining. Ms. Flynn isn't known for writing likable characters to be inspired by, but Libby was interesting. Her emotional growth was kind of stunted because of an event in her childhood, and she just sort of drifts through life and survives, but doesn't really live.I can't really say anything about the story because it's a mystery and I don't want to spoil anything. I felt like a lot of this book was filler, so that the mystery could be drug out until the end. There were so many things that were unnecessarily overly described. At one point there was a whole page dedicated to describing fox tail weeds. This is why for some of this book I wasbored out of my mind. While reading this, I seemed to spend a lot of time thinking about my Christmas to do list, or wondering what I should have for lunch.Overall, it was just Ok. I didn't hate it, but it didn't blow my mind either.
