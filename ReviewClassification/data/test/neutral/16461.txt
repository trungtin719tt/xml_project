So...Warriors. No, not that awesome 80's flick starring that guy fromXanadu. Unfortunately.Warriors, Into the Wildis Book 1 of 6 (SIX!!) in the first of like---- a zillion series. My 10 yr old daughter is inlovewith these books---she can devour one a day (and the way that they are churned out....) She is so into these that she asked my husband and I to give them a shot. Fine, I can take one for the team, I mean, heck, she'sreading, right?Thing is, it's not so bad. You've got a li'l bit of Tolkien and a splash of Shakespearean tragedy in a Jets vs. Sharks sorta way...
