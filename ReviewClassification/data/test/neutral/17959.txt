The usual forced gaiety of the brothel swirled around him, but nobody male or female bothered him. Perhaps it was Retribution unsheathed on the table in front of him. Perhaps it was merely the look on his face.I enjoyed the book and liked some of the characters. I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. Azoth/Kyler was a nothing, a low-life that was in a bad situation along with many other kids. But Azoth didn't want that life any more. He wanted to be an assassin like Durzo Blint. And Durzo didn't take apprentices, but this time he did, he changed Azoth into Kyler Stern. He tried to make him a strong killing machine with no heart. He showed him how to poison, how to fight, how to use magic... but.. Kyler still had a heart.Kyler did the one thing Durzo told him never to do. Do. Not. Fall. In. Love. It will get you killed. Durzo pretty much knew what he was talking about in this book. But alas, Kyler can not help falling in love with the sweet Elene, who happened to be someone from his past.It turns out that Durzo happened to love after all, and most things he told Kyler always came to pass, if he told the truth that is."I'll miss you. You're the closest to family I'll ever have. I'm sorry I brought you into this life. Momma K and I did everything we could to make you a wetboy. I suppose it's to your credit that we failed. You mean more to me than I ever thought another person could."Kyler blinked back tears. There was no way he could kill the man who'd written this. Durzo Blint was more than his master; he was his father.Durzo and Momma K (who runs a brothel) took Kyler out of a bad situation and tried to teach him book learning and how to kill. Seems kinda funny when it's read in that context, but that's how it is. Momma K tried to help a lot of kids as much as she could. I don't like the fact they called assassins wetboys, it sounds just weird to me, but I digress.I was really shocked at some of the things at the end. You just never know what you will find out and why people hold things back until they die.Fin
