At least this one has a happy ending... I am noticing a pattern in Sparks' books though which is kinda disappointing because I have enjoyed the few that I've read, but it seems like they always contain the same core elements.One thing that annoyed me in this book (which, I realize, has nothing to do with the storyline at all) is that when they are making homemade ice cream, Sparks lists the ingredients they are adding which include a cup of flour. You don't put flour in homemade ice cream! Did that bother anyone else, or just me? Other than that, I always notice spelling errors in Sparks' books that a simple proofread could have easily corrected.
