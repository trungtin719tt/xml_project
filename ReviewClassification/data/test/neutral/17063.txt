3.5 stars. I'm still grumpy about the fact that you need to go dig up a Briggs novella,Alpha and Omega, in a separately published book,On the Prowl, to read the (pretty much necessary) first part of this story. I would be even grumpier if my library hadn't happened to have a copy ofOn the Prowl.I also got a little impatient with Anna, our main character and an "Omega werewolf," although you need to cut her some slack because of the events in theAlpha and Omeganovella. But the overall storyline, with ancient, bitter events coming back to haunt our characters, was really very good.Review to come.
