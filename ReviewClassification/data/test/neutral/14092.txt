The book belongs to urban fantasy genre; it was written long before the term was created. So humans did something really stupid (in my opinion formed after I finished reading) and legalized vampires despite the fact that these creatures need to kill people to exist - as everybody knows.To justify this I can only say that this is not the first time the humanity acted like complete retards - we can all give countless real-life modern examples.Anita Blake was a reanimator meaning she could raise zombies. This skill often comes handy as dead people can tell interesting tales.She also did not belong to vampire fan club; Bella Swan she was not. One day the master vampire of her city offered her a job she could not refuse; it was all about the right motivation obviously. It seemed somebody was killing innocent (huh???) vampires and Anita was to investigate or lose her life as well as get her friend killed. As the title implies Anita had some experience of dealing with annoying bloodsuckers so when they finally got on her nerves she realized it was time to quit acting stupid and start kicking some undead butts. Some long-awaited action finally came.I was very surprised by some things about the book. Unlike what reviewers said it did not suck outright. In fact it was decent enough. I also found Kate Daniels' granny: Anita.For those unfamiliar with the latter lady let me just say that Kate was heavily influenced by her and the influence is quite clear. Anita even possesses trademarked Kate's sarcastic humor. To be fair I have to say Kate Daniels writing is better.Thus on the negative side the writing is not great (but passable) and there are plot holes and just illogical and just stupid things aplenty; Anita's IQ drops to single digit range sometimes. On the positive side any relative of the current Queen of urban fantasy deserves respect. I was never bored reading the book.It night shock somebody, but I will give this novel the same rating as I gave to Kate Daniels #1: 3 stars. I have to say that there are 3 stars and there are 3 stars. This rating can mean "Nice, but I am not reading the next book" and also "I am mildly curious what comes next". This time I use the second meaning and will continue with the series.
