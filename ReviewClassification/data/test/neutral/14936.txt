So, Sookie doesn't actually have sex with anyone in this book. I think I'm a little disappointed.This was a reread, and I've read this series all out of order, and enjoy them, while forgetting them entirely in between reads. But when I came into this one, and realized at the end that Sookie isn't actually with anyone in this book, I was a little...confounded.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
