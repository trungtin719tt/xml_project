This is my first reread (re-listen). I plan to reread the entire series and catch up on the last few books I haven't read yet. This first book is an oldie. It's PNR from the time before PNR became a popular genre. In fact, I believe I originally bought it under the Historical Time Travel tag. But it led me to the most amazing PNR series, so I was/am very happy about it.There are, admittedly, some eye-roll moments in Fantasy Lover, and like all PNR, you do have to suspend disbelief. However, underneath that there is a really sweet romance story about two broken characters who are the perfect cure for each other.I really, really like this story. 3.5 stars
