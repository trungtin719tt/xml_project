This is a lovely retelling ofBeauty and the Beast.Robin McKinley's writing is fluid; the descriptions of the castle, landscapes, and even clothes are clear and vivid; horseback-riding scenes and interactions with horses are reflective of the author's superior knowledge of the animals. But other than that, there is hardly anything memorable aboutBeauty.I don't know about you, but expect any retelling to bring something new to the original story, some new layers, better understanding of the characters, more intricate backgrounds.Juliet Marillier'sDaughter of the Forestis a great example of a retelling done right. McKinley'sBeautydoesn't bring anything fresh to the table except maybe that Beauty is not particularly beautiful in the beginning.My other problem with the book is that Beauty's world before her arrival to the Beast's castle is very vaguely defined. It's hard to even envision in what time her story is placed - 16th, 17th, 18th century?And finally, the ending of the book is anti-climactic to say the least. Everything happens so fast - the Beast's transformation, love confessions, introduction of the Beast's story, Beauty's sudden realization of her... well beauty, the wedding. All of it is just crammed in the last 2-3 pages. Disappointing and unsatisfying.Many of these negatives, however, can be forgiven if you keep in mind that this book isRobin McKinley's debut. And the writing is lovely.
