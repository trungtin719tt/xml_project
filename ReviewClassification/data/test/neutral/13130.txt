Stepped at times past the wavering border of absurdity for me. Most of the time Murakami hangs onto just enough plausibility and his brew shines and goes down smooth. That old Murakami magic I wait for, that unexplained lucidity rising to the surface. But this time he barely missed. I rooted for him, out loud-Come on baby-you can do it-you're almost there-pull me into the story. When a writer like him barely misses a lot of pieces shatter on the floor and it becomes work for me to paste them together to get that Murakami high or its resemblance.He remains one of my favorites. I ordered his new book. That's who that guy dressed in brown pacing in front of my house is. Hey put that book back in its box. What? You think its good. Real good. Forget the box just toss me the book. Yeah you can come in. Always time to talk books, talk Murakami.
