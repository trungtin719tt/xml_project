I want to give this one a four-star because it's C.Harris and she's amazing. Her voice is utterly unique and delightful and I love her characters. What's more, her world is very real, her vampires are interesting, and I love that she's taken all of her carefully laid-out plots and sent them topsy-turvy in the wake of Katrina. Very little has driven home the tragedy of Katrina as well as CH's last few books.But this was clearly not a whole novel -- it was more like a handful of short story ideas all tumbled together into a book-length collection. A fistful of (largely) unrelated things happened all about the same time, pretty much willy nilly. The pile up of coincidences is too much for me.Also, Sookie is unusually cranky in this book. Okay, there's a lot of crap piling up on her head, but she's usually so sweet.However, all that said, CH is clearly setting up some really really interesting stuff for the next four or five books. I understand when series need these "set up" books -- it's hard to keep over-arching plots going four or five books ahead without taking a pause. But they are usually the ones that become my least favorites.
