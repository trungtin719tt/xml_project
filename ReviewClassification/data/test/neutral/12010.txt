We expected to like this book a lot, on the whole we liked it, we found it well written and it kept us guessing what would happen.We enjoyed the start, the planning of running away was fun. The idea of running away to a museum really appealed to us, when I was small I so wanted to spend a night in a museum and look around whilst it was dark and quiet, so I was really looking forward to this part. We were both full of admiration that these runaways had remembered to take their musical instruments, full kudos for keeping up the practise whilst on the run(view spoiler)[ oh it was a trick to stow away their clothes on a music lesson day(hide spoiler)]We read this as a read aloud and after the beginning which we enjoyed it went a bit flat for us. For some reason we thought this might have some night time adventures in, but it didn't. I thought there might be some sort of magic or time slip or some interaction with history or art but there wasn't. The mystery of Angel didn't really interest either of us(view spoiler)[ it didn't interest us if Michael Angelo made the statue or someone else did really, if we liked something it would make it no more appealing to us to be made by someone famous, although we did like the way the evidence tied in with the will and why Mrs Basil. E. Frankweiler was narrating the story and talking to her solicitor.(hide spoiler)]We read a copy with an afterword by the author and two pages that were what the author described as, as close to a sequel as you will get.(view spoiler)[ We hoped Claudia and Jamie did go to see Mrs Basil. E. Frankweiler again, we liked her(hide spoiler)]
