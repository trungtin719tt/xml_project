I love Nicholas Sparks and this one didn't disappoint. I guess because he's written so many they become somewhat monotonous, so I didn't go above 3 stars. This one was a little heart-wrenching at the beginning because there is a 4 year old boy that is missing, and being a mom of a little boy, I could hardly stomach reading it. Around page 100, the story moves into the "love story."As a note to myself (or reminder so that I don't buy it again), the book is about a fireman and a single mom. The mom takes care of her son all day and works in a diner at night. The book is set in a small Southern town on the East Coast. The son has a speech problem which require time and patience from the mom, and the fireman adopts easily to their lifestyle. The fireman takes all of the risks when dealing with fires as a way to cope with his past experiences related to his father.
