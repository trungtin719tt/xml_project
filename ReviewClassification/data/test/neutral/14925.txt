I admit my review is a little skewed as I had seen the movie several times before ever reading this book. I think that made the book a little less exciting, hence the 3 stars. I did however enjoy reading it and noting all the differences between the book and the movie. I think that I like the book better, as usual. I still found it satisfactory enough that I read it quite quickly, by my standards. It only took me about a week to complete. I was disappointed that the book seemed like it would be for an older audience, I would hope that my daughter would someday read it as the message is good. However, I think she probably needs to wait until well into her teens as the book contains some language, sexual content and other things that I would deem only appropriate for an older audience. There are several lessons in the book that I find important for any girl or woman to understand, and I think the author teaches them well through her characters. I probably won't read this again, but I did enjoy it.
