If you are familiar with John Green, you probably already know his winning formula: a nerdy nice guy with a funny side-kick best friend, meets and falls in love with a mysterious popular but ultimately unhappy girl, then some kind of road trip ensues during which a life altering realization is achieved."An Abundance of Katherines" is no exception. Only this time the nerdy guy (Colin) is not that endearing (unlike Miles in "Looking For Alaska" or Quentin in "Paper Town"), the funny side-kick (Hassan) is not that funny, and the mysterious girl is not that mysterious or witty (compare Lindsey to Alaska and Margo). The 3rd person narration also doesn't help the cause. I think this kind of POV makes Colin unrelatable and exposes him for what he really is - a self-centered insecure super nerdy nerd whose head is full of theorems, anagrams, and numerous random facts. At some point you can't help but start thinking that if you were dating Colin, you'd break up with him just like all of his 19 ex-Katherines.In spite of all the flaws, the book is still moderately entertaining, the story picks up significantly in the end. And unlike "Looking For Alaska" and "Paper Towns" it has a satisfying happy (for a change) ending. "An Abundance of Katherines" is a decent read, just not as good as other John Green's books.Reading challenge: #1 - A
