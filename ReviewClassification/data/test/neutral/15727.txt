Yea, verily, a young mouse yclept Matthias doth live peacefully in the walled city of Redwall, wherein reside all manner of goodhearted animals like mice, badgers, squirrels, etc. (not to be confused with the mean villain predators like rats and foxes). It comes to pass that their bucolic lifestyle is disturbed, nay, gravely threatened, by an incursion of an evil cohort of rats. Mayhap Matthias will rise to the occasion and become the heroic warrior that will save hispeopleanimals in their time of greatest need!This is a fairly enjoyable middle grade/YA medieval fantasy in a world populated entirely by mice, rats and other woodland creatures, with nary a human in sight.So I was maybe a little too old for this one when I read it; it's more for the younger teens and tweens. I think I might have adored it as a 10 or 12 year old. Anyway, it has many thousands of fans and has spawned like a million sequels, so if you haven't read it yet and it sounds interesting, you may want to give it a try. The language inRedwallisn't as archaic as my review may make it sound. :)
