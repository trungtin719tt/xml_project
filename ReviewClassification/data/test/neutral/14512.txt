This is catalogued in our library as a mystery. Why? I have no idea. It is really not a mystery series at all. That said-I really liked this series.These are reprints and were highly recommended in an issue of Booklist. There are Werewolves, vampires, and witches that all live in the secret society of the Night World. Humans are not just the enemy, but are considered vermin. Each book seems to pick up a different story line about the world. It was odd, but I think Stephanie Meyer has to have read this series at some point. There is the idea in the series that everyone has a soulmate. IT really really reminded of the whole idea of imprinting in the Twilight series. It is the same theme of undeniable love whether you want it to be like that or not. The concept itself is nothing new whatever you call it, but it was the way in which it was described that made me think there were a lot of similarities. Or maybe not.
