I didn't actually read this book, but rather i am in the process of reading Loecraft's short stories one at a time on this website:http://www.tmoct.co.uk/lovecraftlibra....His writing shows it's age; it is scientifically dated and horribly racist, and the entire writing style is hokey and cliche, but nameless terrors and tentacled cosmic horrors are so darn cool to read about. You can't really call yourself a geek unless you have read The Cal of Cthulhu!
