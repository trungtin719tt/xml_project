the book "Brave New World" written by Aldous Huxley takes place in the future world where people are "made" and they are born with levels. In my opinion, this is a great book, however, the comparison to "1984" and "Animal Farm" this book aren't as good. This book is not directed enough in my opinion but it does use interesting details to show how the world is range.
