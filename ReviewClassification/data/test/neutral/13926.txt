Yay, I did manage to finish it this weekend. I feel so accomplished. =) Okay fine, I didn't 100% finish it. I skipped those two 20 page poems that were like about bible people?? And completely dialogue?? Bc let's face it, what? Why would I care about that? But it does count as "read" ok, IT COUNTS. I read 95% of it, hell yes it counts.Overall I fucking hated the poems that were like 13 pages long. I couldn't stand them! But the shorter poems were really beautiful, but THE LONG ONES JUST KIND OF RUINED MY EXPERIENCE A BIT. But also the short ones were nice and pretty and well done, so I have sort of kind of maybe mixed feelings.
