Wow, I feel like it has been 84 years since I read the first book of this series. After reading the synopsis for this one, I can see why I waited to dive into it. I'm going to be honest here, I was hesitant as fuck to read this because I didn't want to end up hating it. Mostly because I already started the spin off series and I actually liked that book.So, here it goes.Prettiesis the second book of theUgliesseries. In it, you will still be reading about Tally. However, there's just something different about her nowadays. She is apparently gorgeous af. Just woke up like this - basically?Speaking of Tally, she was a bit better this time around. I don't necessarily hate the girl but she's becoming likable (in a way). Besides her, there's Peris, Shay, and Zane. Now Peris is and was difficult to understand. Mostly because he was pointless. It felt like he was just there... to be there. Nothing really happened with him and I ended up just throwing away his character while reading this.Then there's Shay, who was a bit more interesting and Zane was really just Zane. Oh, I forgot about David.. mostly because this entire book forgot about him. Now I liked this book but it had a lot of cons for me. Whether it was the pacing, the dreaded love triangles, or idk throwing peris in and taking david out - which still baffles me.Overall, it was an okay sequel that gave a good ending/cliffhanger. I'll probably dive into the next book but I have zero expectations for it so far.
