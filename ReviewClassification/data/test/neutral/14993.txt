The formula is pretty simple:Big Mystery + Male Protagonist + Female Protagonist + Code to Solve + OMG TRAITOR WITH TWISTED MOTIVES = Best Selling Novel.And it's worked, so I guess we can't hate on him too much. There are people who swear his books are the best thing they've ever read -- I certainly wouldn't say that. But they are successful and I have to confess, even I like them, and when it comes to books I am Picky with a most definite capital P.Digital Fortress is the first one I've reread -- I read it yesterday. Coming straight from that into Deception Point, I've noticed very quickly that Dan Brown recycles description/emotional response."Although she had practically lived in Crypto since its completion three years ago, the sight of it still amazed her. The main room..." - Digital Fortress"As Rachel made her way into the maze of bustling corridors beyond, she was amazed that even after six years she was still daunted by the collosal scope of this operation. The agency..." - Deception Point"Susan waited for the punchline, but it never came." - Digital Fortress"Rachel waited for the punchline. It never came." - Deception PointAll his characters might as well be the same people -- David Becker (Digitial Fortress) might as well be Robert Langdon (Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code) -- ordinary people caught up in higher things, in over his head and things somehow work out fine. Susan Fletcher (Digital Fortress) is, like Rachel Sexton (Deception Point) a professional woman, pretty, the best in her field, similarly in over her head and somehow coming out okay.Also, the infodumps get terribly annoying. A brief bit of dialogue and then an absolute shedload of explanation. Another characteristic of Dan Brown's novels -- all very formulaic, as I said.But hey, it's a formula that works.
