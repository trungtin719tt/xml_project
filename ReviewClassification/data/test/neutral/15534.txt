I had conflicted feeling about this one. I hated how there came to be so much angst from Sookie about Eric. This is the one where he "tricks" her into a vampire marriage to try and protect her from Felipe de Castro.There's some boring stuff about Jason and his wife, Arlene does something stupid and boring, and then there is the whole fairy war thing, and that just never appealed to me much. I think it was dumb to kill off(view spoiler)[Claudine(hide spoiler)]. There is a reveal about Sookie's parents and some fairy background. Meh. Like I've said, I only read for Eric. He does save the day in this one too.
