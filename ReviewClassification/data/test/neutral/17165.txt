This book is BAD! Which is why I love it so much. Susann had no idea how to write a book.Susann's shallowness and immaturity (you get the impression a 14-year-old wrote this) is rampant throughout the book. No one has real feelings. People get married as business contracts. All men cheat; women never do. Blonds are icy and cold. Brunettes are smart and nurturing, and only women with glossy blue-black hair are sexy and passionate (Susann's hair was black).Her pacing in the book is just wacky. One of the main characters disappears after the first few chapters, then reappears toward the end just to kill herself. Her reason: she had to have a mastectomy and her husband only married her for her breasts. And then everyone else is sad for about a half page, then they get on with their tragic lives.The greatest line from the movie actually comes straight out of the book. Neeley chides her nemesis, aging star Helen Lawson, by saying "I saw that fag you came in with." To which Lawson replies "At least I didn't marry one." And then the famous cat fight ensues.It is a horrible book, and if you love the movie, you will see that the film makers were actually trying to transend their source material. If I ever taught a writing class, this book would be on the reading list. Because if this piece of crap can get published, and then go on to sell over 30 million copies to date, anything can. And that should give a young writer some hope.
