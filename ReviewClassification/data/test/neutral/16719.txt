Sadly this was the book I enjoyed least so far in this series. I found Phury to be infuriating ( I wanted to write inphuriating ). I kept wanting to tell him to get over himself and deal with things. And the ending did not help at all since it was just too neat and easy. After 500 pages of angst how could everything be fixed just like that!The other parts of the book however were great. There were story lines galore and heaps of character development. A nice little happening at the very end guaranteed that this reader definitely has to move on to the next book and soon:)
