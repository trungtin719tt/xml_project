Let me confess something before I start my review: I dived in this book with lower than zero expectations. My sister has read them and she kind of hinted at them not being as good as the PJO series so I was very hard on the story. Thus, the three stars. I mean, I went in to hate the characters -which I kind of did- but overall, how could I even think about hating a Rick Riordan book?The Red Pyramid, is sort of similar to other Rick books but had its own special moments. For one, it was about Egyptian Gods. One of the reasons I didn't really enjoy this story -which is my fault, not the book's- is because my knowledge of the Egyptian Gods was Zero. In result, I had a hard time having fun because I was busy figuring out the Gods.My second problem is that I didn't like the characters, Sadie in particular. Which is again me, not the book.But in the end, everything was fast-paced and the plot was interesting. I also liked they were kind of narrating the story as a recording.I'm going to continue with this serious and try to be less of a judgmental asshole. Hopefully, I will have more fun.
