Having now finished this book that came so highly recommended, I have to admit that what I feel mostly is indifference. I wanted to love it, but I didn't. That being said, I didn't dislike it either. The problem was that I just didn't care a whole lot one way or the other.The story is about a young woman, MacKayla, that goes to Ireland to play detective after the death of her sister. In no time, she's uncovered a whole new reality, full of supernatural beings that she had only thought existed in fairytales. The more clues she unearths, the more she begins to wonder if she's following in her sister's footsteps.Along the way, she partners up with Jericho, who is looking for the same ancient book that MacKayla is. The sexual tension is off the charts between these two. However, MacKayla doesn't know if she can really trust him or not.There is a fair amount of action/adventure in this book and it is relatively suspenseful. I would have liked more romance, but it just wasn't that type of book. It is the first book in a series, so that may change as the series progresses.Although the story was just kind of "okay" for me, I did think that the narration was done well. So often when I listen to audiobooks, the narrators butcher a southern accent. Often times, it ruins the entire story for me as I want to cringe and cover my ears. Finally, somebody got it right!Overall, I give it 3-stars. I would have given the narration 4 or 5-stars though. It was a nice story to pass some time, but I didn't love it like most of my friends did.
