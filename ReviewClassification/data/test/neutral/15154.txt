*3.5*I feel like the main reason I didn't love this book was because of my expectations beingwaytoo high. I had heard that it was "the next Gone Girl", and I can completely understand where that comparison comes from. Later in the book, a couple of the characters actually reminded me very strongly of Nick and Amy, which kind of just seemed like too much. I wanted to read somethingalong the same veinas Gone Girl, but not an exact replica. This wasn't an exact replica, but there were enough similarities that it sort turned me off a teensy bit.As most people have said, this is one of those books where NOBODY CAN BE TRUSTED. All of the characters are horrible in some way, and you never really know who did what. There are sort of six main characters in this book (three men and three women, one of whom goes missing) and the synopsis tells us that(view spoiler)["only one of them can be the killer!". So, um, thanks for the spoiler, synopsis. Now we not only know that the woman who went missing DIES, but also that one of the five others definitely did it.(hide spoiler)]THAT TOOK AWAY FROM THE INTRIGUE A BIT.Another thing that sort of deflated the BIG REVEAL for me was that I had a really twisted theory about one of the characters, and it didn't come true. This may not seem like a big deal, but I feel like the author inserted some very specific clues that led me in that direction, and I was disappointed that it didn't end up being true. (I'll talk more about this in the liveshow at the end of the month, so make sure you read the book so we can discuss it in all of its spoilery glory!)The book overall was a pretty slow read, and the main thing that kept me going was the knowledge that there was a big twist later on, which I didn't necessarily see coming, but I didn't find to be that shocking either. The last 50 pages were the only ones that actually had me hooked, and I wish the entirety of the book had been more gripping, but I still thought it was pretty enjoyable, and I'm excited to talk about it at the end of the month!
