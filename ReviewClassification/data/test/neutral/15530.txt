The scattered book 8 set up for this one nicely &amp; much was resolved. This book was more on track, as usual &amp; about the same caliber. It should be read in order. It's a soap opera, so you need the background to appreciate how our heroine works through her various difficulties. All in all, more fun reading candy.28May11 - re-read the HB which I now own. Teresa loaned me the new book #11 &amp; I've 're-read' the series up to this point in audiobook format, downloaded from the local library. Parker did an excellent job reading, but it is a lot faster reading.
