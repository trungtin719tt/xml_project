It was okay.I know the basic story, as many people do. I've seen the famous movie with Richard Burton and Liz Taylor. I 'studied' this particular play in college, too, and overall I am not overly impressed.It's the story of a young man who wants a rich wife, but the wife he wants has an older sister who must be 'married off' first. (Typical trope, seen in many a story, movie, etc., and this was already a well-known trope in Shakespeare's time, too.) So clever machinations ensue in which another man, Petruchio, is persuaded to woo the older sister, Katharine or Katharina. (Or Kate.)But that leads to yet another problem, Katharine is a shrew. Difficult, complaining and just plain miserable. (Today we'd say, get thee to a shrink!) Petruchio thinks he can tame the shrew and is willing to do so for her large dowry. Hijinks follow including some extremely witty repartee. Long story short, he 'tricks' her into becoming nice and honestly, even for the time in which it was written, were women that much fooled? I mean I'd be in the audience saying oh yeah, right, whatever - but in early modern English of course. :DWell I enjoyed the reparatee, but honestly, it's like everyone in this silly play is in disguise half the the time, and that IS another trope used by many a 16th-17th century playwright. You want something done, disguise who you are. Men become women; women become men; old become young; rich become poor. I read an annotated version and kept writing in the margins: So-and-so is So-and-so, or at the top of a page, REMEMBER, Tranio is pretending to be ...I tried watching some diff. versions online, too. My brain was still confused.An interesting play, well worth watching or reading, but not my favorite. Not at all.
