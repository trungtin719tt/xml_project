"If you wanted to do something absolutely honest, something true, it always turned out to be a thing that had to be done alone."When I think ofRevolutionary Road, I can't help but think of a friendemy I was acquainted with some years ago. Our conversations usually started out charmingly enough (she was quite the bookworm), but usually ended on a low note when she'd start criticizing everything about me in a jovial, joking sort of manner. I never knew if it was me or her that was nuts! Anyway, one day I remember her inviting me to have dinner at a little Thai place. I reluctantly agreed, but then nearly left the restaurant after awkwardly waiting 45 minutes for her at a table alone. When she finally graced me with her presence it was to tell me she'd been outside...in her car...listening to the last part ofRevolutionary Roadon audio disc. She couldn't tear herself away. I was prepared to finally tell her off and to get lost, but this revelation made my annoyance dissipate immeadiately. She'd said it was engrossing, but that she hadn't enjoyed it.Having finished it myself, I find that I feel exactly the same way. I've never disliked so many characters in one novel!
