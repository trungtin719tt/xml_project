Fangtasia's new bartender is a Pirate; The Shreveport wolves are about to have a new Packmaster; A sniper is targeting shifters and most importantly....Not one...Not two...Not three...Not even four...You wish it was five but no...SIX, yes, SIX males are after Sookie's affections.What's a waitress to do?Fun and fast read as always.The mystery was well executed, even though a bit predictable. There was more world building through the ceremony that would decide the new Packmaster, and a new character who'll probably be sticking around is introduced.As for Alcide... What can I say? I never was a fan of his but...Let's just say that there was a twist in the plot that made him lose some Sookie points. First Bill, now Alcide, I hope the same doesn't happen to Eric.Speaking of Eric, I wish there was more of him in this book. Three scenes weren't nearly enough for the fun element that he brings into this series.Pam too. More Pam, please!
