Definitely not as good as Pride &amp; Prejudice in my opinion. I felt like I didn't know Captain Wentworth as well as I got to know Mr Darcy and I wasn't as pulled in by the story. The writing is still beautiful and I loved getting an insight into the 1800's, but it wasn't my favourite.Around the Year in 52 Books Challenge Notes:- 15.
