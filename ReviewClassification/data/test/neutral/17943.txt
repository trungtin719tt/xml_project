*I received a free copy of this book, via Netgalley, in return for an honest review*Mundell &amp; Lacast's debut novel was penned considerately, and was a quick and enjoyable read - easy to follow, and packing a whole host of thought-provoking facts and concepts. Whilst the book seemed to be aimed at a YA audience, I think it would pretty much appeal to any audience 12+.What I liked:- The world-building was pretty sublime; it was SO COOL to contextualise the brain in this way, and learn about it at the same time.- The characters were provocative, and captivating - all pretty well developed, and interesting enough to follow. They sometimes became a little unrealistic, but hey the whole plot revolves around a wormhole into the brain (unrealistic in itself), so it's acceptable in my books, and not something to dwell over!- The whole concept was incredibly clever in itself.- There was a good conglomeration of humour, with drama, and FINALLY NO ROMANCE IN A YA BOOK *cheers*- THE ILLUSTRATIONS WERE ALL SO REFRESHING TO SEE - it's been too long since I've read a book that isn't afraid to support the plotline with pictures!What I didn't like as much:- The ending was a little abrupt for my liking, but I did like where the story closed.- I'm no scientist, but I always thought that the left/right brain theory was disproved? Hmm, I'm not sure, but I won't hold it against the book because they utilised the brain so well in other areas- I couldn't help but compare the Holons (residents of the brain) to the characters in Inside Out. I'M A TODDLER AT HEART.Favourite quotation:"Resentment is like swallowing poison, then waiting for your adversary to die."Rating?3.5 stars (closer to 3, as you aren't allowed to give half-stars)Would I recommend it?Yes, and no. It's a deserving quick read with an absorbing plot and likeable characters, but I wouldn't tell anyone to move it to the top of their TBR's. That being said, I really enjoyed the book, and with their ability to conjure gripping plots with an easy-going writing style, I'm looking forward to what Mundell and Lacast have to offer in the future!
