"Pretties" suffers from middle-of-a-trilogy-itis. It has to move the story forward, setting up things to come in the final installment, but it can't necessarily push things too far ahead for fear of losing audiences in the next installment."Pretties" picks up a few months after "Uglies" ended with Tally having undergone surgery and become pretty. We're treated to glimpses of her hedonistic lifestyle now, but a lot of the first third of this story had me wondering when the real plot would kick in. In the last novel, Kally agreed to go undercover, get the surgery and then have it reversed so she could return to the Smoke. As "Pretties" unfolds, Kally has forgotten this due to the surgery and is more concerned with joining the hot new clicque. She is also developing a new love interest, who seems far more interested in the world outside than in the current situation.In order to recall their ugly, rebellious days, Tally and her new beau must stay "bubbly." During one of these times, Tally is contacted by her old friends, given her letter and given the means to reverse the surgery.Once Tally finds the way to reverse the surgery and begins to try to go back to her old self, things pick up. But a lot of the revelations in the last two-thirds feel incomplete, as if Westerfeld is setting up events and situations for the third novel. In the end, Tally is once again forced to make a choice she doesn't want to in order to save herself. We're set up well for the next book, which hopefully will provide some answers to a lot of the lingering questions left in this story.
