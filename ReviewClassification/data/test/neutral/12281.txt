Yes, I'm still reading this series. Great literature? Hell, no. An enjoyable, sort of mindless read, sure. There are parts that I find very funny, such as Sookie using her "word of the day" calendar to improve her vocabulary and the part where the Viking vampire Eric mentions that he took English as a second language in a community college course in the 70's. That sort of stuff is pretty humorous. The parts that annoy me are the writer's fashion sense. It kills me when I read her description of Sookie being all dressed up in bright red satin, with matching red fingernails and toenails, with (insert barf noises here) long sleeves you slide on separately. You know the author thinks that Sookie is incredibly stylish and beautiful, yet I keep having bad 80's fashion flashbacks. Also annoying are ALL the vampires. Seriously, they have no redeeming factors to me. I much preferred the werewolf character, Alcide, and I hope they keep up his relationship with Sookie in successive books. I am so over the vampire Bill. I couldn't figure out the attraction of him in the first place and in this book he cheats on Sookie. Puh-lease. He is so dead to me. (pun intended).
