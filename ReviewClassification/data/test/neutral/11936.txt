It's done. It's over.**faints**Review to come.6/2/16Ok, folks, here comesTHE REVIEW..You might want to put on a seat belt. There is a LOT to say for this one.....Ok. This book. Ahem.If you already read it, you probably know the first thing onanyonesreview is that the book was SLOW. And I mean agonizingly, bang head on the wall, scream in frustrationSLOW.Fifteen. Thats the number of chapters that was spent, in essence, onone scene. Thats right, the great Gathering. Where many things were supposed to happen, that after fifteen, nay, nearly twenty, if we include the Gathering wrap-up clean up, finally happened.It was agonizing, torturous, and it didn't help that I fell asleep every time I tried to read it.(ok...I could watch that duck forever...especially the little head shake in the end. &lt;3 Seriously, look at it. Look at it! ....Ok..Moving on....ugh. LOOK AT IT! Great, now I'm like Gabaldon, unable to move past a Gathering, er, duck viewing....)The rest of the book didn't really improve. It continued it's crawling pace, and it took me many days to even finish two chapters at a time. I started to use it as a pre-curser to mynapsfor Sassenachs sake! I kid you not; My Da would pop his head in, see me with the book, say that he'd wake me in two hours.Near the very end, maybe 85% in (not that I was carefully keeping track of when it would end), she sparked a little,littlemore interest with her murder mystery at the plantation. THAT was another marriage and gathering that took FOREVER, mind you. And was way too much a rip off of Gone with the Wind, if you ask me. Gabaldon realized it so much that she even had Claire MENTION how much it was like that particular book.That bothers me, where they can't come up with enough description and such on their own, that they have to reference another book that is so far of time period wise, even if Claire was from that time period, I just...UGH. I might get some haters here because sure, it was similar, both scenes WERE on a lazy summer day at a plantation...but alas.She fought for plot by random scenes hunting down Stephen Bonnet...which again, as far as villains go...is a disappointment, since my standards are B. J. Randall high. Bonnet is freaking Puff the Magic Dragon in comparison.Ugh, my Randall! My Heart Throb!Just...just look at him!LOOK AT HIM!!This is one of my favs - whoever did this one is awesome.Yeah yeah, I'm a bit crooked, but when Randall was in the books, he and the situations actually pulled EMOTIONS from me. So...That's why he is a big plus.No judging.Anyways, where was I? Oh yeah, Bonnet being Puff the Magic Dragon. And how it should have been reversed in my mind - Randall lived, Bonnet dies. Please and thank you.Can we make Claire go back to thepastpast and somehow save Randall or...or SOMEONE?I volunteer as tribute. *throws self at stones*And then...then...the most severe of errors in the book thatPISSED ME OFF ROYALLY...Jamie was bit by a 'poisonous' snake....I'll give you a second to see what was wrong there.....Nobody?A poisonous snake? I mean really?REALLY?Did you touch avenomousivy while you were at it?Snakes areVENOMOUS. And since she bothered to specify WHAT sort of snake it was (yes some snakes may excreet POISON from their scales/skin, like tree frogs), it further pissed me off; RATTLESNAKES EXPELL VENOM!VENOM!!!!!!.A quick review, lads and lasses;Venomous,Poisonous(wait...why is he touching that? No, stop that, don't do that. Stop.)Venemous...NOT POISONOUS(Damn...that...that has to be painful...)Learn this lesson well, Gabaldon.Don'tdisappoint me again.Other than that...Not one of my favorites from the series...but based off the reviews of the next book, it should improve. So...cheers to that. I WILL hold my breath....So...you better deliver.
