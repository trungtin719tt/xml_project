Want to see more bookish things from me? Check out my Youtube channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...This book follows Ruby Cooper who was abandoned by her mother a few months ago and has been living on her own in the old yellow house they rent. When the adults in her life discover this, they ship her off to live with her older sister, Cora who she hasn't seen in over 10 years and her husband Jamie. At first, Ruby is reluctant to accept any of the help her sister and Jamie try to provide for her. Then she meets her next door neighbour Nate and things change when his own secret begin to surface.I did enjoy the story, but it was just average in my opinion. At times I felt like it dragged on a bit too long and became boring. I did enjoy a lot of the characters. Ruby was a complex and interesting main character and you really empathised with her through out the story. I liked watching her character grow and learn to accept help from others. I really liked Jamie and how enthusiastic and happy he always was. Roscoe was by far my favourite though, I love how in pretty much every scene he was just peeing on everything. I loved the relationships in these books and how it was more about family than romance. I really liked Olivia and Ruby's friendship and I'm glad they became friends. I liked reading about Cora and Ruby's relationship as well and how it shifted throughout the story. I also enjoyed how she incorporated characters from her other books into this one, it was an interesting concept.
