2.75/5 stars(rounded up for Goodreads).For full review please visitmy blogSense and Sensibilityis considered to be the weakest novel (I read it somewhere on the internet, so I don't know how reliable that is) of Austen (I found that out after I got done reading it). Now I am kicking myself, for it was my very first novel by her.I really wish I have chosen something else to be introduced to the author, because this book did not work out for me at all.Edward Ferrarsis the dullest secondary character ever written. He is devoid of any emotion until maybe the last 20 pages of the book, and even then it is very mild. I also found him quite lazy and spineless, for he seemed almost content with having everything decided for him by women in his life. He does take a stand and stands up for himself very late in the book, but by that time I was so done with him.Elinor Dashwoodis a step behind Edward in her dullness. She is the composed sister. She is a sensible one. She is so good at hiding her feelings that she doesn't even know she has any feelings, despite all that time that she devotes to sitting around and sorting through her emotions and thoughts.Marianne Dashwoodis the irrational sister. The unstable one, if you might say. She loves and hates equally passionately and is often found falling into hysterics because of her personality. If not for Marianne I would have probably stopped reading. She brought some liveliness into all of the grayness of other characters. I enjoyed Marianne's main storyline the most.Margaret Dashwoodis the third sister. She has about 10 sentences devoted to her in the whole 350 pages of the book.Mrs. Dashwoodis the mother of the 3 sisters. She has no opinion of her own and relies on her two older daughters to stir her in a correct direction. When she does make assumptions on her own they are always completely wrong.John and Fanny Dashwood. John is a half brother of the sisters and Fanny is his wife.Fanny is manipulative and John is spineless. The dynamic of their relationship can be seen at the very beginning of the book and that chapter is gold!Mrs. Jenningsis mother of Dashwood's neighbor's wife. She always puts her nose in other people's business. Follow the gossip and you will find Mrs. Jennings.Sense and Sensibilityis a world in which only your money and birth status matter. Where people judge you by your manners, your money and your estate. For most of the book characters indulge in gossip and judging other's behind their backs.Nobody looks at the person's heart - they all look at your etiquette and your ability to hold a conversation in their snobby society.The ending seemed very forced to me - like two sisters just had to be married in the end of the book.Now onto some things that I did enjoy.I really liked Marianne's love for reading(hello fellow book worm!). Her resolution to read for 6 hours a day really resonated with me.Also her need for solitude with herself and nature, and her ability to walk out of the room any time she didn't feel like interacting with other people made her my favorite.Even though this book was less than mediocre for me, I am not giving up on Austen and will read another novel of hers, before I decide that maybe this is just not my style.But I honestly hope that the next novel of hers that I read I end up liking.MyWEBSITEMyINSTAGRAMMyWORDPRESS BLOG
