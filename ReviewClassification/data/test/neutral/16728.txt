My preparedness for the regime change taking place in the United States--with elements of the Electoral College, the Kremlin and the FBI helping to install a failed business promoter who the majority of American voters did not support in the election--continues withThe Man In the High Castle, the Hugo Award winning novel by Philip K. Dick published in 1962. Dick's sheer output and high concept hooks that can be reduced to three words--"Axis Won WWII"--have proved irresistible to film and television over the years, but reading this novel was like reading the dayplanner of a middle manager: thought provoking at times but terribly dull.The story is set in the Pacific States of America fifteen years following Capitulation Day in 1947. Robert Childan is the owner/operator of American Artistic Handcrafts, trafficking in traditional ethnic art objects, Colt pistols from the Civil War being a popular item. One of his clients, Mr. Nobusuke Tagomi, is a fussy, high ranking official with the Trade Mission. Mr. Tagomi is in search of a gift to impress a Swedish industrialist due to arrive in San Francisco by rocketship. Officially, Tagomi is to broker a meeting between the Swede and a retired Japanese admiral to discuss plastic injection molds, but Tagomi's instinct tells him that his client is a German and a spy.Frank Frink, nee Frank Fink, was a G.I. who ended up on the Japanese side of the settlement line, fortunately; his ancestry as a Jew would mark him for extermination in Reich controlled territory. A metalworker, Frank has been fired for mouthing off to his boss, Mr. Wyndham-Matson. Frank consults theI, Ching, the Chinese divination text which the Japanese have made popular throughout the PSA, for advice. He pines for his ex-wife Juliana, a gypsy beauty who moved to Canon City, Colorado and is now a judo instructor. Juliana is at a hamburger stand and picks up a young Italian truck driver to keep her company in bed. He tells her his name is Joe Cinnadella.In the alternate timeline that serves as a spine, Franklin D. Roosevelt was assassinated in Miami in 1933 and the New Deal never got off the drawing board. After victory in Europe and the Pacific, Nazi Germany and Japan attacked the United States, ultimately dividing the U.S. in half, with the Rocky Mountains region a buffer zone between the superpowers. German technological superiority has drained the Mediterranean and converted it to farmland, while their moral depravity used atomic energy to unleash a holocaust on Africa. Most of the best comedians were Jews and have been killed, but Bob Hope lives to mock the Reich from Canada.A shop foreman who worked with Frank Frink convinces him to manufacture contemporary American jewelry. Frank consults theI, Chingand agrees to the venture, but can't help but make trouble for his boss, whose most profitable line is the replication of "authentic" Colt pistols which the Japanese can't get enough of. Frank visits American Artistic Handcrafts and accuses Childan of selling fakes. Childan cancels his business with Mr. Wyndham-Matson, who laments this to his secretary Rita. The boss man's woman pines for what could have been had the Allies won the war, a fantasy concocted in a banned novel everyone's reading titledThe Grasshopper Lies Heavy.The novel imagines that Roosevelt survives assassination and pulls America out of the Great Depression. FDR's popularity keeps an isolationist, pro-Nazi regime from the White House. The U.S. fleet is not wiped out at Pearl Harbor. The British defeat General Rommel in North Africa. Without oil, the German advance east is halted in a city named Stalingrad. Adolf Hitler is put on trial for war crimes. In Wyndham-Matson's analysis of this fiction, the Communists and Jews take over the world, but Rita is beguiled by the book. So is Juliana Frink, who's heard that its author is an ex-serviceman who lives in Cheyenne in a mountain compound he calls the High Castle.There's a lot that happens inThe Man In the High Castle. The most compelling involves a banned book and its power to reach across borders to inspire dreams of a world beyond the dismal one of the present. That would've made for exciting science fiction and it's one I started writing in my head while reading this. Being stuck in Philip K. Dick's head gets mundane. There are academic conversations on fascism. There are banal discussions on a political crisis in Germany following Chancellor Martin Bormann's death. There are endless consultations of theI, Chingwhich are as fun to read an instruction manual forDungeons and Dragons.At no moment in this novel was I concerned about the safety of the characters, which is hard to believe considering Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan are in control of the United States. Slavs, Poles and Puerto Ricans are deprived educational opportunities, apparently. Slavery seems to exist for blacks, I think. Because Philip K. Dick couldn't imagine a world where any of these ethnic groups could be characters in a science fiction novel, it's hard to say. The entire alternate history conceit isn't utilized very well beyond Dick telling how bizarre things might've been if the Axis Powers won. Most unforgivable is the novel is boring.I was intrigued by Dick's suggestion that conquered Americans might not hold any more of a grudge against the Japanese or their culture than the Japanese held against American occupation forces in our timeline. Dick elevates Mr. Tagomi to the position of a major character, with Juliana Frink possibly the second most significant character, so unlike so many of his contemporaries, the author can't be accused of casual racism or sexism. The biggest offense of the novel is its administrative dullness, with political backstory made front story and characters getting lost in a purple haze of dorm room mood enhancing drugs.
