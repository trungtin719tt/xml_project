The Magic Mountain: Thomas Mann's Ambiguous BildungsromanAh, Thomas Mann, you have held me captive from a hot summer's day in August until I have begun to see the first hints of color tinging the leaves with a hue that will lead to their fall and ultimate decay. You have occupied my thoughts during long days and nights. I do not know whether to bless you or curse you, for I recognize how precious time is. At times the tick of the clock sounds ominous.At its most basic level Mann tells us of the cultural and social development of one human being, Hans Castorp. Hans is not unique. For each of us is born a blank slate. Those that surround us shape us with their values and beliefs. We accept them at times. At others we reject them. Each of us is a walking, waking, living Bildungrsoman, the great majority of us never being the subject between the covers of any book.Through various times in my life I have experienced illness. In a relatively short period of time, I recognized that I lived in a brief period of respite from life in a relentlessly care worn world. Indeed, in my youth, chicken pox, measles, infected tonsils, and suffocating asthma attacks, provided me with a short vacation in which I whiled away the hours reading my beloved books.I have encountered my Circes, my Madame Couchats. I have reveled in the power of Dionysus, my Herr Peeperkorns. During my odyssey I have felt the lure of the lotus eaters. But more than anything else, if I accept Mann's character of Hans Castorp to be some wandering Odysseus, I also recognize that we are frequently caught between Syclla and Charybdis and must navigate between the two.It was not until I became an adult with a responsible job, the responsibility of parenthood, that I felt the possibility of mortality. It was the fall of 1982. Each day I would begin with my customary energy only to become wracked with a fever in the afternoon and left in a state of listlessness and fatigue.A visit to my physician was required. A battery of blood tests followed. I was to meet with my doctor to discuss the results of the tests the afternoon of the same day. He was somewhat irritable that my lab work had not yielded a diagnosis. He stared across his desk at me, tapping his temple with a forefinger. I caught the beginning of a wry grin. Ah, Hofrat Behrens, you would have recognized the look of incipient triumph. Another vial of blood was drawn from me by his nurse. We both waited for the analysis in his office.Although we were separated in age by considerable years, we both shared a love of music. Both of us had been concert clarinetists in younger times. We discussed our favorite pieces of music.The nurse entered after knocking, handing over the analysis. "By God, I love diagnostic medicine," my physician proclaimed with a great degree of professional satisfaction. "You have hepatitis!""How serious is that?""Oh, could be nothing. Could be sky's the limit!" He chuckled. I did not.Of course, I was quarantined in an isolated room at the hospital until the type of hepatitis could be determined. It was "Non A, Non B" hepatitis. Type C had not even entered the medical vocabulary at that point. The source of my illness was and has remained a mystery. Nor have any symptoms ever returned, though I am screened annually.However, that event over thirty years ago, was an important factor in the formation of my personal Gestalt of what it means to be a whole human being. While "Hans in Luck" enjoyed a seven year respite from responsibility, the pawn of Herr Sembretti and the absolutist Naphta, each of whom struggled over the young man's soul in a pedagogical exercise, I consider his story to be an ironic and imperfect Bildungsroman. I do not consider Castorp to have ever fully come to occupy his place in society as a fully developed human being.To be sure, Mann's writing is breathtakingly beautiful innumerable times. But in Mann's afterward to his monumental work, he urges the reader to undertake a second reading to fully understand it. This, I cannot do. Time is precious. Mann's dark humor causes me to reject such an effort for I cannot endure the lingering naivete of his protagonist. Perhaps, there is too much of Joachim Zeimssen in my view of life. Perhaps I was born to be a flatlander. I am content with that.Hans, requiescat in pace. May you have found purpose in your life.
