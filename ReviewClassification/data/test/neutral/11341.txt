I know many love this series and Stephanie Plum. Unfortunately, I just couldn't connect and didn't find her ineptness all that funny. My investigators/detectives have to have some level of smarts, either streetwise or instinctive. That's not Stephanie and this isn't my kind of mystery but completely get how this character and story may be appealing to many.I won't be continuing the series.
