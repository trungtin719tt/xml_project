This book was a pleasant surprise. The plot is quite wild actually: one day, all people over the age of 15 disappear, and young kids are left to fend for themselves in a world, where "normal" rules no longer exist. In this new world, the FAYZ - Fallout Alley Youth Zone, the unimaginable happens - animals rapidly mutate, some kids acquire special X-men-like abilities, coyotes led by the mysterious Darkness try to overtake humans.Undoubtedly, this sounds like a lot of craziness, and yet it all somehow works together and creates one fascinating and intriguing story. The characters are well developed and relatable, their back stories are familiar and compelling. The struggles of good vs evil are very well written. My only complaint is that sometimes this book has just too much action, at times I felt as tired as the book characters of constant running and fighting. However overall it's a great novel and I am looking forward to reading more books in this series to find out what happens next to the characters and to see at least some of the mysteries of the FAYZ solved.Update July 19, 2010. Almost a year later and 2 more installments, still haven't worked up any interest to read more of this series (?).
