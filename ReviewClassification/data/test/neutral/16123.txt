3.5 stars.I feel like I'm getting too old for Chuck Palahniuk. Not because his books are geared towards young readers in any particular way - I mean, they are definitely adult books - but because of his writing style. It's definitely something that I would have loved if I'd been in my late teens/early twenties, in my university undergraduate days, but now I just feel a bit like rolling my eyes when I read certain sentences.Saying that, I did enjoy this book for the most part.Survivorhas a really interesting concept: Tender Branson, the last remaining member of the Creedish Death Cult, has hijacked a plane, emptied it of passengers and pilot, and is currently telling his life story to the 'black box' as he is running out of fuel and preparing to die in the crash. His life is a satire of both the cult of celebrity and religion, and there were genuinely amusing moments throughout this book (even if they were overarchingly depressing to think about). I also really liked the fact that the chapters of the book were in reverse, as we as readers count down towards the crash, as well as the end of Tender's life. It might seem gimmicky to some, but I really felt like it worked well in this case.Like I said though, I'm too old for Palahniuk's prose I think. He is overly explicit, and while this doesn't bother me, it does get old quite quickly. This book wasn't as full of sex and language as some of his other books, and didn't rely as heavily on shock factor (there was more substance here than something likeSnufffor example), but it did feel like it was going a bit downhill towards the end of the book and I was eager to just get to the end of the book after a while.I'm not sure if I'll pick up another Palahniuk book, unless the concept really appeals, but if you're a fan of his writing style I'd definitely recommend this one over others. It's not quite up there with the likes ofFight ClubandDiary(which I think are genuinely good Palahniuk books, and less predictable), but this is definitely one of the better ones.
