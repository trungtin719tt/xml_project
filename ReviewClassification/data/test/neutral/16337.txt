Haha, oh boy. Mr. Coelho here. In general, you try too much. In retrospect though, I have come to several conclusions. Some of them even about this author too.Let us be frank and shameless. Paulo Coelho has always been a one-trick pony. Somewhere along his existence as the main go-to writer for the pseudo-intellectuals, he perfected a formula. Which he pretty much copied and pasted more or less throughout his career. Let's be fair, most writers flounder with their themes, often just repeat themselves. In this instance, repetition is certainly not the key dear Kongos. And I am not saying Coelho is a hack. He can write. Moving words sometimes.No idea why, but PC and his cultish followers have always rubbed me the wrong way. Maybe it's just my aversion to crowds. I don't like being in one. I don't do people. I like popular writers, don't get me wrong. Martin, Gaiman, King, you name it. I love them all. I just happen to love Larry Brown more.I don't know. No matter how hard this faux-philosopher tries, he comes off as a very poor man's Rumi. However, of all his tepid offerings, 11 Minutes is the most tolerable. So there is that. I have to give him that at least. Plus, I really did like the MC and the skin of her lies. Mostly because she had embraced the shame. As she should. Which reminds me, Aurora is in Brazil right now. Can't believe I said Aurora and Paulo Coelho in the same sentence. Well, stranger things have happened. Or are about to in any case.Although all the sex featured in this book was rather boring and pedestrian. I'll be honest, it did seem revolutionary back in 2007. But what can you expect? What did I know. I was alive back then. What? You thought I was going to say I was a virgin then? Haha.You know, ofttimes it is the making of something that's far more interesting than the final product, the end result. I always liked that Seven Minutes (which is a more realistic fun time, let's be honest) had inspired 11 Minutes.Despite the similar titles, I didn't catch that at first. Even though it's based on the Irving Wallace's fine, as always well researched amazing novel, this is a soft pastiche at best. 11 minutes ironically is lacking and not on par with the original. In more ways than one. Even in its absence, its excellence is evident. For more of a satisfactory finish read the more real and realistic Seven Minutes by the ever sublime Irving Wallace. Incidentally, Seven Minutes was published in 1969. Now that seems almost divine.The fact of the matter is. The drear girl that I still like is still here, despite being dead, still she should read this book as she had planned to once. Just as I had planned to kiss her. But I am not going to now.Is this suddenly ghoulish?So, what. I like peripetia and this is still Halloween month.
