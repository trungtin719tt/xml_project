I keep feeling like this book is like something else that I've read, but I couldn't tell you what that something else is.I guess it's kinda like Kurt Vonnegut meets Robert Anton Wilson meets . . . maybe Chuck Palahniuk, emphasis on maybe, but very much Vonnegut meets Wilson.And kinda Philip K. Dick, a little, just less of the science fiction and more of the mind-blowing philosophical standpoint.That being said, I liked it. It'sincrediblydense, in the sense that there is so much in it. The language is something unto itself, and when I happened across it in the Borders in Providence Place Mall, it was the language and the first little introductory page that convinced me I had to go back and buy it. It's at once prose, poetical, intellectual, light, jovial, didactic, aloof. Really something else.I couldn't help but wonder, as I went through it, how the hell he wrote it. What kind of research he had to have done, if he did any. I mean, the story itself is basically a very simple story, but it's all the layers that are interwoven on top of it are really something else. It boggles the mind. I mean, there are things that just kind of stand out as periphery (Bingo Pajama, unfortunately, being one of them) to the overall story, but the amount of philosophical inference and banter, the journey throughout time, perfumery culture, like, where do you find this stuff? Impressive. Utterly impressive.
