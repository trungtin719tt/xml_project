Spoiler Free Review3.5 STARS out of 5Genre: Adult Romance Erotica"You know what happens when you run, angel." Gideon nipped my lower lip with his teeth, and then soothed the sting with the caress of his tongue. "I catch you."Gideon Cross is one smooth EVASIVE motherfu**er, this book only solidifies that fact.Reflected in you has Gideon and Eva trying to move forward in a relationship that seems impossible for them to uphold. Their passion for one another is like a Tornado. A Tornado that is unstoppable and can change it's course at any given time. It can never be predicted, and that's exactly how their relationship felt. Chaotic, it could go from zero to sixty in a nano second. I found their love to be desperate, extremely intense and possibly reckless. Yet they fought for it with every breath that escapes their lungs.ThoughtsI.. What... Wait, let me start over. **inhales then exhales**This book was theSUPER DUPER LOOPER ROLLERCOASTER!You know the one I'm talking about. The one that leaves you all discombobulated after you get off! **sighs heavily** This book was waaay to...up and down for me, way to many break-ups and make-ups. Not enough we're together now "happy happy joy joy."Just a bunch of- I love you- Great sex- I need you- More sex- I'm jealous- I want you- A nightmare- A break-up- I need you- Make-up sex- More Jealousy- A break-up- I hate you- Sobbing- False pretenses- Some bird flipping **chuckles** Eva gave the middle finger gesture twice! I liked that!! A lot!!I'm sure I missed a few I love you and hot sex moments but you get the gist of it. And I found myself wanting to choke Gideon. Often. YES I know that when we finally reach the end there is a method to his madness/shadiness.... But he still grated my nerves.I have a true love-hate relationship with this book. Some parts I loved and some I did not. But hey that's me to each his/her own.This book gets 3.5 stars because I was able to predict every plot twist. I knew exactly what/who Eva's mom saw outside of Crossfire. So the mystery was gone for me. Couple that with the shaky relationship they had and it made the book hard for me to enjoy. I will continue with the series and I am very interested for what Sylvia Day plans to do in book #3.My RatingsCharacters- LovableWriting Style- GoodPlot/Storyline- Clever, Intense and SavorySteam Factor- High/Very SteamyOverall- I liked it but I did not love it! Do I recommend it? Yes!Now go forth and read. Then come tell us about it on Goodreads!
