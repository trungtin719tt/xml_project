Re-reading the play this time, I liked it a little better than I thought I would. I predicted that the brutal treatment of Katharine by Petruchio would ruin the play for me, but it didn't. From the induction involving Christopher Sly, the text of "The Taming of the Shrew" is full of so many transformations (tinker to lord, page to lady, servant to rich young man, rich young man to teacher of grammar, rich suitor to music teacher, wandering scholar to prosperous merchant, etc.) as well as so many literary allusions to Ovid and other metamorphoses, that Kate's transformation from shrew into obedient wife seems just one more mythological marvel produced by the magic of the stage, with Petruchio as the play's protean Prospero.But I'm making the play seem better than it is. It is a very slight entertainment indeed, a farce whose lack of even comic seriousness is one of the reason why its brutality and misogyny are relatively inoffensive.
