"What do you mean 'They' cut the power? How could they cut the power man they're animals!"Aliens(sure it's the wrong movie, but a cool quote nevertheless)The book has very little in common with the movie. The film is something that is ubiquitous on cable. You can probably see the entire thing in snippets just by changing the channels over the course of a year.In both the film and book, the soldiers battle big bug thingies. The book is only bookended with battle sequences, the rest is training and talk. The film has plenty of CGI action.The book features much discussion about the nature of the soldier and the place of the military in the distant future. The film has Denise Richards.The film has a coed shower sequence and some sex. Sadly, the book doesn't.The tech Heinlein envisions reminded me of video games like Halo and Heinlein wrote this in 1959. Kudos, sir.Ultimately, it's a fairly interesting read that lags in the above mentioned "discussions".
