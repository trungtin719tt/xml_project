What I like:&gt;The book has vampires and vampire hunters in it.&gt;The book has an interesting love triangle.&gt;I love Lucas.&gt;It wasn't boring and a nice quick read.&gt;Truth is it's hard to put the book down.&gt;I love that the story has twists in it.What I don't like:&gt;Lacks originality, the plot is a mix of Twilight (average girl goes to new school, falls for hot, mysterious guy) and Vampire Knight (love story between a vampire and a vampire hunter).&gt;Cheesy dialogues that made me want to puke.&gt;I hate Bianca sometimes but at least she's more tolerable than Bella Swan.&gt;I think the story could have been better if it has good dialogues.I could have rated it higher if I haven't watch Vampire Knight yet.Note: Vampire Knight is an anime okay, if you haven't watch this and you like Evernight, you better watch the anime/read the manga because it was way better than this one!!!
