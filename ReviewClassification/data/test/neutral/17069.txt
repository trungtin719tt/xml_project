I was first introduced to Briggs' writing with the story Alpha &amp; Omega in the anthologyOn the Prowl. The story is a prequel to this book in which we get to meet Anna, a reluctant member of the Chicago Pack werewolves. Three years ago, she was turned against her will and since then went through emotional, physical and sexual abuse by her Pack. This was done to 'break her' as Anna didn't automatically act submissive around more dominant wolves. Anna is special: she is an Omega, which means she's protective and brings peace to a pack with her natural ability to soothe the wolf-part of a Were.When Charles Cornick, the enforcer and son of the Marrok (the leader of the North American Werewolves) comes to Chicago to investigate the issue, he has an immediate attraction to Anna. Better yet, his 'Brother Wolf' has too. As it happens Anna and Charles' wolf counterparts pretty soon see each other as "mated". The human counterparts however, especially Anna's -traumatized as she is- need a while to get to know each other.And that's whereCry Wolfstarts off.Anna goes back to the Marrok's territory in Montana with Charles and tries to find her place in the new life she's got presented. In the mean time there's a rogue on the loose which needs to be brought in.Unlike the Mercy Thompson novels, the emphasis in Cry Wolf was less on the action and more on the romance. Which was good for two reasons.One: the love story was very well done. There's a lot of awkwardness, tension, misinterpretation of feelings going on between Anna and Charles. Charles, being his father's assassin for over 150 years, is not good with words, doesn't like to be touched and is feared by just about everyone... but with Anna he is so incredibly patient, gentle and sweet. And Anna: she just wants to like him back but she needs time and trust to overcome her inhibitions.I loved how it was written out and it was very endearing in general.Two: there really wasn't that much action to begin with. Only in the last half of the book is there more excitement in that department. And still, the ending is a bit of a let down. To me, Anna and Charles just as well could have stayed home and be awkward with each other for a while longer, I'd enjoyed that more.In general: Briggs' writing style is simple but effective. She has a nice way of portraying her characters. I especially liked reading about Charles' perspective, I find him more interesting than Anna. The bad part is that Briggs' plot in this book seemed really simple too. Not much really happens and too much is based on coincidence. I think I wouldn't have minded a break from the romance if the action parts were better thought out.Still, Cry Wolf was an enjoyable read. The 3 star rating seems a bit harsh, but 4 would have been just too much.
