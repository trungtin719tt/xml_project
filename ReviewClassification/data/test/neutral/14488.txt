This wasn't one of my absolute favorites--just okay. I have read several Nicholas Sparks novels and I put this one in the category of "True Believer" and its sequel, "At First Sight".By now the author pretty much has a formula which he follows in most of his books: always set it his home state of North Carolina, there is always a storm where the plot twists and/or reaches its climax, someone usually dies, and the couples always fall in love and end up in bed--usually, boring, uninteresting sex ensues. This 14th novel is no different.Logan Thibault is an ex-marine in search of a woman whose photo he's been carrying for the past five years. He found it in the sand in Iraq and ever since he has carried it, he has felt lucky. It has helped him win big at poker games, and kept him alive in situations that, by all accounts, should have ended his life. His friend, Victor tells him he has a debt to pay to the woman in the photo as it has proved to be a lucky charm. When tragedy strikes, Logan follows his friend's advice and sets out on foot, with his dog, Zeus, from Colorado to North Carolina, stopping along the way to seek information about E.--the only letter of the woman's name found on the back of the photo.Upon entering Hampton County, Logan has a run in with the local sherrif who doesn't like the looks of him or of his German shepard. This sherrif later on becomes a big player in this story as he interferes in Thibault's life and plans.Here is where the action begins. Of course, Thibault finds the woman in the photograph and what usually happens in Sparks novels happens, but the story lacked the passion found in "The Notebook" and "Nights in Rodanthe". I don't feel like Sparks ever really peels back enough of the layers that make up these characters. I never get to know them as well as I should. A lot of his stories are just on the surface--and once in a while he ends up with a winner like the two previously mentioned books. For the most part though, his books are airport novels--an appropriate read to pass the time but it doesn't stay with you. I have found that to be the biggest disappointment with most of his books. NONE of them are keepers. Here is another one for the donation pile.
