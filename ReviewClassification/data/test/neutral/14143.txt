Book 19/100 for 2015UPDATE: Giving it 3 stars because it's only been three months and I've already forgotten everything about this book. I enjoyed reading it, but it was so similar to many other YA books that it's not memorable.WOAH. That was an intense book and I really enjoyed it! I am a sucker for superpowers and this book had such a cool variety of them! I was so into this book that I stayed up very, very late two nights in a row so I could see what happened next. It was a little predictable at times and I can see why people say that it's really similar plot-wise to a couple of other books, but I still liked it very much! I just want a little more world building and a little more romance (I'm always going to vote for more romance, to be honest), but I'm almost positive that that will all happen in the next book!Also, I really want a map for the world! I feel like that would be such a cool addition to the book.
