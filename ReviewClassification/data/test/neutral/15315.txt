Imagine my surprise when on an unwanted trip to WalMart I found the new Charlaine Harris, on sale, and newly printed on paperback! Book 8 was read super fast by me, but relished like super spicy green coconut thai curry, as I now realize that only sporadically will I be afforded the opportunity to read up on Sookie &amp; pals.I must admit my initial fondness for something that began masterfully enough but has since degraded itself to comedy, cliche and confusion. Sookie is still the same--as are the handful of minor characters--and this is what makes me return to these outlandish novels.Book 8's first half is about the end of the Were War, and the second half is about the new installation of Ruling Vamps to the Louisiana legion. More characters are killed off while new ones or met... making the Sookie Stackhouse saga even more unpredictable. Yup. But this is the end of the line for me.
