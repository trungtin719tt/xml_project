Very touching book. Much of what the protagonist goes through is very close to my heart, and reading the last chapter made me teary. I'm not a parent, but I am a daughter, and reading this book has reminded me in a gentle and soothing way the sacrifices parents and caregivers make for their children.Told in flashbacks and the chapters often around two to three pages long, the book was a quick read. Despite the content material, I didn't feel emotionally burdened by the end but instead a little lighter. Like the ghosts of our loved ones in our hearts, the story visited, reminded, and left with a fond farewell. But it will always remain, in some form or another.
