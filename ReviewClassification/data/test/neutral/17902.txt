March 2017 Review:This is now my third time through Storm Front, and while my rating is holding tight at three stars, I enjoyed it more this time thanks to Spike from Buffy and Angel reading it to me. That guy nails Harry Dresden's character and breathes new life into him. His carefree "whatever yeah here I'm reading the book, alright?" tone was awesome. It made the story so much better.It also made me realize how one of the only adjectives Butcher knows is the word "naked". Everything and everyone in the book is naked at some point. Harry walks outside with naked feet. A room is illuminated with naked color. Lots of naked people. He just really seems to like the word. I felt like it showed up at least a dozen times and stood out because at times another adjective would have worked better. But I digress...This is a good book to just get lost in and not think too much. Don't overthink the magic or the spells or weird characters. Just let the story play out and you'll be fine. It feels like a weird episode of the X-Files in book form, or like I said two years ago, it's like a Goosebumps book for adults.I'm gonna try a different approach and not be overly critical as I read through these first few books. I'm having a good time, and I hear things only get better as the series progresses. I kind of enjoy the pulpy writing style with a mix of crime and fantasy genres. I'm not crazy about Harry being all macho but then stepping aside to remind us all how old fashioned he is. He just likes opening doors for women and bringing flowers to dates, alright? Leave him alone. Not sure why he keeps bringing that up and then goes back into tough guy mode.I've read the next two books before and then quit. I promised myself I was done, but I've never been good at keeping promises to myself. I should really stop doing that. Anyway, I hope I enjoy those s little more this time around and plow through the other books. Looking forward to seeing what happens. Third time is a charm... right?Previous review from January 2015:Second time through, and I feel about the same way. It's like Goosebumps for adults. it just needs a more clever title. Here are my contributions:"Thunderbolts and Lightning, Very Very Frightening""Say Cheese and Die with ThreeEye""The Wizarding World of Harry Dresden"
