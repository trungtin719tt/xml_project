Bob knows I love a good popcorn read and they don't get much more corny Charlaine Harris' Sookie books. Reading about Sookie's misadventures with the vampires that live out in the open is always a good way to spend an afternoon in the sun. So finding out that the newest addition to the Sookie series came out on Tuesday had me more excited than I am comfortable admitting.Four hours later the book is finished and I'm relaxing in the heady afterglow of a fun tale well spun. Yet, was this a Southern Vampire Mystery? Not so much. This was all nearly all-fairy, all the time. Of course there were the usual shenanigans with shifters coming out into the open, following the lead of the vampires that started it all. This would have been far more interesting if Harris had made it more of a focus of the story rather than getting embroiled in the royal intrigues of the fairy princes.Still, it's a good stop-gap for those anxious to dip into Sookie's little world of Bon Temps for a little while. Here's hoping that with book ten Harris leaves the fae alone and focuses on what made this world so interesting- watching the vampires and werewolves, these ancient creatures that have haunted nightmares for centuries, try to integrate into contemporary society. It's always good for a smile.
