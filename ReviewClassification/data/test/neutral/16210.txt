The Ruins of Gorlan is one of those stories that doesn't really bring anything new to the table. It follows almost every troupe that is related to the genre, but that doesn't mean it's a bad thing. Its like when you re-watch Supernatural season 1 or watch the old Star Trek. You aren't there for anything new you're there to watch the Kirk's over acting and Bones being grumpy or Dean and Sam before the dark times. When they were happy and didn't have to worry about saving the world.That's how the Ranger Apprentice series (at least the first one) felt like. Don't read this series for something new; read it for something old. Read it for the troupes and coming of age story of an orphan. Read it for the grumpy teacher that actually cares or the misunderstood bully. Like I said it brings nothing new but dammit the book was well written enough for me to recommend it.Re-watching the Supernatural and I'm almost at the end of season 5 and guys...I'm an emotional wreck at this point.
