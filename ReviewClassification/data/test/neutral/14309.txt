I've had this book and the second of it's series for awhile. They set on my bookshelf and just look pretty. I would have read them one day...and then the third one came up on Netgalley. I have a Netgalley problem and I requested it, thinking that it would push me to read these. Yeah right.Then my buddyEdward Lornstarted reading this. He started posting updates. He teased me enough that I couldn't keep ignoring these books. Damn it.So this does have one of my favorite 'end-of-the-world' things going. A virus happens, this one happens to be sort of man-made. Because man-kind is sorta stupid. Things NEVER EVER NEVER work out when they start tampering with sciency stuff.This first third of this book was freaking awesome. I loved the whole FBI secret stuff and the lead up. Then the next third of the book happens.I LOATHE how this part of the book worked. Cronin just jarred my little mind into a whole nuther story and I almost threw the book down and did my first dnf of the year. But I'm trying to be good and that Ed Lorn kept posting updates about how it got better and he is a dang old book pusher and I kept reading. DAMN IT!I also did not like another thing about this book. Everyone using "flyers" as a cuss word confused the heck out of me. Just cuss or don't. Don't make weird words into them without the reader really understand it...because I thought since the boogers in this book have some super almost flying powers that they were talking about them.Then the last third came in and saved the day. I didn't put the book down once it started. I couldn't, my fingers were glued to it. Now I'm interested enough that I can't wait to read the others.Now for the baddies, these vampirey things don't sparkle. But you don't really hate them. I liked this..something new always gets my interest. Except I totally saw them in my head as this:No question about who I'm spot lighting on this book.Ed's review is hereEd is one of my favorite reviewers. He makes me want to squeeze in books that I never would have picked up otherwise. Plus he cracks me up.
