Listen I tried. I tried hard. Multiple times.BUT I CANT UNDERSTAND A WORD HES SAYING!!!!Not only are the first how many pages written in like a handwritten/diary style making letters hard to separate but the slang he uses in unlike anything ive seen and getting through a single sentence takes the same amount of time I need for a normal paragraph.The story started great, it did, I wanted to read more. But ive had this book since 2012 and its sitting on my shelf all gorgeous, hardcoverish and expensive and its pretty much all its gonna do. (plus it has a skeleton on the cover and I LOVE it!!)I don't think its fair to give it less than three stars given that I didn't get through it but I cant give it any more given that finishing it seems like a 007 mission.I like the main character, hes weird and a great narrator and I get the impression that I would truly like this book. I might try again at some point but for now I hate to say this but DNF. The struggle is real.
