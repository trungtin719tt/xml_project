It took a while for me to finish this one. In the beginning I really liked the story and thought I would finish it quickly. It turned out to be the opposit. I don't know what it is with me but I like to do all kind of others things at the moment than read. The story was okay, not as tear-jerking as other stories I've read of Nicholas. Was surprised by the outcome eventually! All in all a nice read :-)
