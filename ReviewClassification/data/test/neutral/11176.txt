I remember this being my favourite of the Narnia novels as a child but as an adult I'm not quite sure why. This time around it felt like a simplified re-hash of The Lion, The Witch and The Waredrobe.The newly introduced character, Prince Caspian seemed like a weaker, watered down Peter from the last book. I did however like the cast of animal characters.Either way this was an easy way to start off 2019!
