Giving this book 3 stars simply because I like Eduard.I've read three books by Paulo Coehlo so far-Veronika Decides to Die,The Devil and Miss PrymandThe Alchemist.And even though I gave three stars to all three of them,I keep going back to Coehlo.I love his characters,I guess that's what I like the most about his books.And his endings are the best.
