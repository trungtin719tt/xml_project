I will always compare every Nicholas Sparks book I read to my favorite, The Last Song. Because of that (and also because of the fact that I listened to it while driving home from college (and the narrator had a creepy smooth-jazz voice that he contorted into a shrill country accent while reading for Beth)), I thought this book was just okay. I never really connected to any of the characters except Ben, Beth's grandma, and Zeus and honestly I thought Logan was kind of stalker-ish for walking across the entire US for this woman that he didn't even know. I did REALLY like the ending, though! WOW. Character development up the wazoo! I borrowed the movie from my local library back home and will be watching it tomorrow (I'm ready for some hunky Zac Efron ;D).
