Maybe it was the time of year. Maybe it was because my copy of the book was in an advanced stage of acidification with the pages cracking and the glue failing so I feared taking this book with me on the subway (images of high school moments when a dropped binder in a busy hallway could destroy a years worth of work in about three seconds). Maybe I read this too slowly, taking too many days off in between each sitting. Maybe it was the stress and anxiety of working retail, yet again, for another holiday season. Maybe it was that I had enough doom and gloom running through my head for the first half of this book, and then maybe it was because everything turned out so fucking good that it all almost felt like a Christmas miracle that I was too cheered to feel the last section of this book in a properly pessimistic tone (no, there might not be a Santa Claus, but fortunately the world isn't always a ironic and pessimistic narrative either). It's probably a mixture of all the above, but I just didn't get into this book.I'm trying to write this and my goodreads buddy MFSO is railing about the 'populist' attacks against 'serious' capital el Literature that flare up pretty often in some corners of the goodreads universe. I keep checking the email updates to see what he has written and throw in my own asinine comments. I bring this up, because the sector of the book world that usually launches these attacks is certain sci-fi fans.This is a sci-fi book, I guess. It won the Hugo award and it goes in the sci-fi section of Barnes and Noble. That's good enough for me to think of it as sci-fi (and there are space-ships, so sci-fi it is).A professor I had in college, in a sci-fi literature class, used to go on and on about how great sci-fi was because it could deal with Big Important Issues in ways that regular novels couldn't. (cough, bullshit, cough). I'm sorry, I didn't mean that verbal / typed twitch. I mean, correct Professor. Sci-fi can deal with important issues and it has the benefit of being able to create a world without the limitations of strict realism to explore those issues. But, and I'm taking this from the stellar examples my professor put in the reading list of the class, those issues are usually dealt with in an allegorical manner that has a bit of sugar coating and masked in escapist literary tropes. Not that there is anything wrong with this, these conditions are probably all necessary in making a fine-goodsamizdat. Personally, the political messages ofMoving Marsor that book about the women who live in a walled in city were as effective to me as all that free-trade / trade war nonsense that George Lucas infected his prequels with. To me, these books (and movies) might have had an important message but the message only felt like it would be revelatory to someone who had never thought about an issue before. They felt like the literary equivalent of a college Freshman who hears one lecture about some injustice in the world and instantly becomes an annoying radicalized twit out to change the world through pedantic lecturing.Why am I going on about this anyway? I'm not exactly sure. To sum up a whole paragraph filled with half-baked ideas that are sure to alienate more than a few of my goodreads friends (sorry!), I just don't really 'get' most sci-fi / fantasy, I don't necessarily find it that enjoyable to read, and when it gets political it always feels like it's trying too hard for the message being expressed (yes, I'm sure I'm wrong here).This book is about the world after nuclear war puts an end to civilization as we know it (or knew it in the 1950's / 60's). After the bombs fall some monks take it upon themselves to save the remains of knowledge from the dead civilization. Against angry hordes of anti-intellectual survivors hellbent on destroying all of those responsible for creating the bombs that wrecked the world, the monks save texts that they don't know the meaning of but safeguard them for the future. As the book goes on so does time, and from the post-apocolyptic world eventually rises up a new world that (re)discovers the science of our society and eventually once again nuclear missiles are poised to wipe out the entire world (again). There are the fairly usual questions about the nature of knowledge and what is the role of science in the world. Should science continue on doing what it does even if it means that the theoretical breakthroughs in one field also mean that newer and dangerous weapons can be created in another? Should Einstein have just shot himself in the fucking face when he was ten years old? Are we by nature just evil fucking creatures, original sin and all. Are we just inevitably going to destroy ourselves again and again and again?Aren't these the kind of things I like thinking about? Yeah, sometimes. Ok, yes, I like dwelling on the awfulness of humanity. And yes, I like the Nietzschean eternal reoccurrence thing being hinted on, and yes I think that humanity in the not-so long run is fucked, but not because we are all evil motherfuckers but because there are a few evil motherfuckers and you just need a couple at the right time trying win the whose got the biggest evilest dick contest to fuck up everything for everyone else. So, yes these are topics I do like to think about and which I like to pop up in my books, but in this book it didn't offer me anything to really sink my teeth into. Maybe it's the era it was written in, but it felt too much like a slightly more intellectual version of the scare movies of the 1950's, sort of a duck-and-cover /Reefer Madnesswith a CND message.Not that I hated the book, which I think might be the feeling I'm giving here. I didn't hate it. I liked it but it didn't do that much for me. I wanted more or something. The only time I felt like I was getting the 'more' I want from a novel that is dealing with weighty topics such as this was towards the end when the Abbott got enmeshed the fight about euthanasia for victims of radiation poisoning. Unfortunately, this section came in the last thirty pages of the book, and wasn't typical of the arguments being played out through the rest of the book.My other problem with the book (did I actually mention a problem yet?), is that I don't find the book funny. I was promised funny on the book jacket, and one of the two top reviewers on goodreads seems to find the book humorous (or parts of it). I found some parts to be slightly amusing, but I never would have found any part to be actually humorous, the humor when it does occur was more of the slap-stick antic style of funny than, well, something that I would normally call funny. If I had to describe the humor of this book I'd say it's like the 'unfunny' sibling of Vonnegut. Now I'm thinking about the humor question a bit more and I can see why someone would call it a funny book but for me it just didn't do much. Blame Vonnegut for ruining the sort of funny this book has for me.
