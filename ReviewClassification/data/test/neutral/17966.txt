Ok, I have no idea what happened but the review I wrote earlier just kind of disappeared!! So I have to start all over again. Pffttt!3.5 stars.This is my first taste of Brent Weeks' books and I am really liking it so far. While I noticed a few readers ranting on the whole virgin/whore categorisation of women in this book, I look at it as merely part of the worldbuilding and wasn't irked by it. At the very least, it did not aggravate me as much as a certain group of skirt-smoothing, sniffing, magic-wielding females. Ok, I'm digressing.The master-apprentice relationship between Durzo and Kylar is the foundation of story in The Way of Shadows. While not entirely inspiring at the beginning, the complexities of their relationship and the ongoing politics in Cenaria formed the crucible for this pair. The second half of the book was gripping and almost akin to watching an imminent car crash in slow motion. All these culminated in a climax involving a truly disturbing massacre and an emotionally powerful finale.While the magic system is a tad confusing, it does not detract from the story. Hopefully, the subsequent books can shed more light into its workings. Aside from the awesome Durzo and intriguing Kylar, I especially loved the interactions between Dorian, Feir and Solon and their friendship which seems to be insurmountable by the trials they faced.The only real rant I have is the term 'wetboy', while supposedly denoting a 1st class assassin with magical abilities, didn't inspire fear and awe, but instead sounded really weird.Definitely will continue reading this series. As The Lightbringer series is supposed to be even better, I hope to start on that pretty soon too.
