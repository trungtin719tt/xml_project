Buddy read with theMacHalo groupin June 2016.Ooops, I'm going to bail on this one, sorry guys.Urban fantasy is just not doing it for me these days, and since I've already read this series and it'd be a re-read anyway, I don't feel too bad. :PQuick generic review, though... if you like urban fantasies, this is hands down one of the best series in the genre, overall. Some books aren't as strong as others, but it only gets better. I know that can be annoying, but with this series, I think my favorite book was either book 8 or 9 (Pale Demon).Some of the best world-building I've ever read. Some of the best characters I've ever loved. Seriously. It's worth reading.This one was a little rough. I remember struggling through it a bit, but I'm glad I pushed through and kept going.A 20-something witch is the MC. You've got the vampire partner, demons, elves, pixies, shifters... no spoilers, so I won't go into details. Wonderful series, though. &lt;3
