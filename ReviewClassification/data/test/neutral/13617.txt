This is one of those rare books where the movie is much better than the novel.Skip the book, but do see the movie, "Hugo", which is marvelous.The audio reader's style didn't help matters. Jeff Woodman reads the book like he is narrating it to kids. Very likely that's his main audience, but his reading style is so self consciously slow and declamatory, it detracts from the story.Update 11/28/2015: I got a copy of the physical book from the library. Per the suggestions of GRers Jefferson and Judy (see comments below) I will reread and update the review accordingly. Apparently this is one book where the audiobook alone doesn't do the book justice as there are many illustrations, tricks with typesetting, etc. that are very visual.
