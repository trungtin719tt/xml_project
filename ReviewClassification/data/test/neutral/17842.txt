First of all, I could have done without all the sexual moments. I know this is part of life, which is what this book is about, but much of it wasn't necessary. It ruined the book for me. I read this book with a lot of apprehension - not trusting it and expecting something horrible at any moment.That being said, this book captures human emotions of all kinds, but focuses on being different. One of the morals I took from this story is how we let our differences become barriers. Like Trudi we often assume others are scorning our differences, when in reality many people don't notice or plain just don't care. We all walk through life with our own pair of "reality glasses", and this book reminds us that we all have a different perspective and a different pair of glasses.This book is full of despair and suffering. I was hoping throughout that something wonderful would happen to someone, but even good things turned bad in the end. I've read depressing books before, but the author usually leads the reader to believe that despite the hardships, people are resilient and will carry on. There is usually some bright hope in the future. I just didn't get this same feeling from this book. Maybe it was just me, or maybe nothing good did come out of Germany in the 1940s, but I felt that these characters were just going to have to endure life's continuing disappointments until the day they died, either of old age or at their own hands.Now, I need to go find me a fluffy book to read to get this one out of my head.
