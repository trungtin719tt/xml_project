2.5 starsthis wasn't grisham's best work, in my opinion. there were a million characters that were introduced and i started to lose track of who was who in the middle of the book. a lot of the sentences were also short and choppy. however, i did love to see all the manipulation that occurred- it was so outlandish, but also believable. i'll watch the movie later today to compare the 2!also, happy new year, everyone!
