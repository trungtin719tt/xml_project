This was a disappointment. I was upset! It wasn't what I expected. The previous books in this series were good so who would have thought this one would be a dud. Why didn't I read any reviews before picking it up?! I must be a glutton for punishment!I had two major problems with Lover Enshrined.1. PHURY. Wasn't he supposed to be this book's hero? I felt like he virtually contributed nothing to the story and I couldn't care less about him. For 95% of his story, he kept drowning in his own misery, which I didn't understand exactly what it was. Being neglected as a child? What was his real problem? I became so frustrated that he continued his push-and-pull relationship with Cormia. One minute he acted as if he wanted to give the whole world to her, the next he pushed her away. And he thought it was for her own good. Great! I'm sorry Phury, beautiful long hair or not, I was fed up with you!2. Almost every character in this book got their own POV. Was it necessary to shift perspective from one viewpoint character to another, and another, and another, at every chapter or scene break?There was entirely too much happening in this book. TOO MUCH! It left me curious and confused about what the main plot of this story was. The romance between Phury and Cormia fell completely flat. What was interesting to me was(view spoiler)[the strong and special feelings Qhuinn and Blay had for each other(hide spoiler)].Only one good thing in this book was the friendship between John, Qhuinn, and Blay. I enjoyed these three a lot so I ended up giving this book 3 stars instead of 2. And that's me being generous!
