This 1954 science fiction/horror novel has already been made into 3 movies: The Last Man on Earth (1964), The Omega Man (1971) and I am Legend starring Will Smith (2007). I saw the last two prior to reading this book so I had an easy time following the storyline. This book is said to have influenced the development of vampire and zombie genre particularly the hypothesis that vampirism is to a disease. Incidentally, this idea will not fly for Edward (Twilight). Girls will not like the idea that their good-looking Edward has bacillus vampirus in his blood and Bella will not get infected by a bite but by Edward's airborne spores? So, Stephanie Mayer will have to stick to the old-fashion bite, the original idea concocted by no less than Bram Stoker in 1897.The storytelling of I AM LEGEND is crisp and calm that provides an interesting twist to the horror and danger that the main protagonist Robert Neville was experiencing. Being the last man on earth, he cried when the wayward ugly dog died. He fell in love thinking that the woman who was found to be a spy of the undead was like himself. Since he has the power to stay in sunlight at daytime, he killed most of the vampires who roamed his place during nighttime. Those that were able to survive developed fear for him and in the end, being the last human being left, he became a legend. Thus the title.In my edition of this book, there are also 10 short stories included. I particularly liked THE NEAR DEPARTED (short but effective) and DANCE OF THE DEAD (because of the flashes of scenes with the mother reminding the daughter not to have a drink when out with friends). At times, I even felt scarier reading these short stories more than following the travails of Robert Neville of the main story.This is my first book for this year's Halloween. I still have 2 more for this week to read.
