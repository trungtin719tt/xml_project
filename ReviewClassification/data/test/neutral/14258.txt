Sookie found yet another supe to shack up with, weretiger Quinn. Pretty soon she'll have been with every supernatural being in the area. But somebody seems to be trying to keep them apart, so of course Sookie's in danger again. Add to this her cousin Hadley having given everything to Sookie posthumously, and Sookie finds herself in the middle of a vampire feud with queen Sophie-Ann. This book felt a little flat. I didn't care as much for Quinn as I did for the other men in this series. Though Sophie-Ann is a great character.
