RompI read The Da Vinci Code and then Angels and Demons one after the other or was it the same one twice. Hmmm not sure!The Da Vinci Code was a fast-paced thriller that was a rollicking good read and became a huge success and a movie. Angels and Demons was a fast-paced thriller that was a rollicking good read and became a huge success and a movie. Well, one had Robert Langdon and an attractive female collaborator whose father was just murdered with something branded on his chest and the other had Robert Langdon and an attractive female collaborator whose grandfather was just murdered with something drawn on his chest. Hi, I just spotted the differences. The similarities continue with the style, pace, atmosphere, symbolism, Catholic Church, clues to solve puzzles, and a race against time. I would advise leaving a bit of time between reading the 2 books.The book is an easy read thriller, written as if for a young adult audience. The stories make good films because the plots and storylines are captivating and feed our appetite for conspiracy theories and age-old vendettas stretching back over millennia. I can understand how some people love it and some hate it. For once I much prefer the films!
