This book is ALIVENeil Gaiman's axiom-twisting novel reads like a modern-day fairytale.The Ocean At The End Of The Lanewas recommended to me by so many Goodreaders that it became impossible to ignore.New to Gaiman, I was quickly surprised at how easily he retains childhood memories and then scatters them into the furrows of his work.The narrative flows smoothly and reading becomes effortless, which is always a good sign: the author has a lean writing style and hyperbole is kept to a minimum. The genius is in its simplicity.The story is told from a bookish (and unworldly) boy's perspective, leading me to imagine that this is Gaiman himself (the boy's name is never announced, so that's my daft assumption).His nemesis, Ursula Monkton, has a surname that seems so out of sync with her Christian name that I immediately assumed it to be a crafty anagram of the author's own choosing (it wasn't), though a quick shuffle of this name in an anagram finder did come up with 'Non mortal'.I thoroughly enjoyed this book, despite it being adult-lite.I felt that I was transported back to my childhood again, a middle-aged man enjoying Brothers Grimm once more.Gaiman's writing style is, for the most part, understated, but it does become amplified and fanciful when it's required.Despite being left wondering if this was a children's book that adults could read, or an adult book that children could read, I had such a blast reading it.It was altogether quirky, quaint and magical, but (er, sorry to say) I'd rather have read it when Iwasa child.Hence the two-star deduction. Sorry Gaiman fans! : (Um, I'm wondering if previous readers of this book can help me?At the beginning of chapter three, the narrator has won twenty five pounds on the Premium Bonds. His mother puts this into his Post Office account. Hethenannounces that he is 'thirteen pounds and eleven shillings richer than he was before'.Am I missing something? I'm either being incredibly stupid, or there's a glaring error in this passage? (More likely the former).If anyonedoesknow the answer, could they please enlighten me? Thank you very much.
