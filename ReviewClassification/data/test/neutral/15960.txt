Small, close-knit, picturesque town. Check.Good people with good family values. Check.A terminal illness or two. Check.Long paragraphs devoted to describing the view and the weather. Check.Long, serious conversations. Reminiscing of sob stories. Check. Check.Tearjerkers. Check.It's undoubtly Nicholas Sparks'. I'd know even if I hadn't heard about the book and found it with covers ripped off and title and author's name missing.But for once-and I can't express how much joy I'd felt about this- Sparks had let his hair down.Because. . .There's a bad, crazy, murderous character. Check.Fast-paced , action-packed chapters. Check.And a happy ending *insert fireworks here*. Check and a thumbs up.I watched the movie twice in 2013 and I know exactly what would happen and how the story will end so before turning the first page I conditioned my mind to forget about it, to not even think about it, to give the book a clean slate that it deserved.The first part is engaging enough, Katie is a strong character and I liked that. She also had a dark past that she's trying to ran away from. And Alex is,well, good inside out and has family on top of his priority list.They're clearly meant to be.I admit there are parts that drag,like when they're talking endlessly at the beach or when Katie is recounting her day with Jo. I mean Jo might not know what Alex and Katie and the kids did but we do. Also the characters are far too mature and serious for me to relate to. Alex worries about kids and parenting. And Katie- she's disciplined enough to look only for items on sale while shopping! But I like them both individually and as a couple, which is why I was almost bored as they took and took and took their time to fall in love on the first part of the book.Enter Kevin and it became so much more exciting.Sparks made him sound so confused, and confusing and delightfully disturbed. Reading about him felt like really getting to pick the mind of an actual, real, breathing, living crazy person. His character infuriated me but of course without him this book would've been boring. I would never ever dream of someone even remotely close to him in anyone's real life but in Nicholas Sparks' novel of generally good and normal people, he's everything I could wish for.And then there's Jo.Oh, you'd never suspect Jo to be who she turned up to be in the end. She sounded so real, so earthy. She whined about cobwebs and she sweats! She sweats! What ghost sweats? That's why in the end,at the grand reveal ,I almost weep for making the mistake of seeing the movie first before reading the book. Imagine the shock,the wonderment, the fun I would've had at the incredible surprise Sparks had prepared.Nevertheless I still enjoyed this book a lot, specially the middle to end part. So turned out the guy could write something that has depth, good moral lessons and tearjerker kind of ending but is neither tragic nor boring. He should write more books like this one.Go ahead Sparks!
