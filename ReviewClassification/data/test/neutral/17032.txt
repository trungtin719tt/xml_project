This book is different from what I expected. The title makes it sound like it's about a hunt for Franz Ferdinand's assassin. (He was captured immediately; there was no need for a "hunt" like there was for John Wilkes Booth.) The "hunt" is figurative, not literal. The author follows the path that Gavrilo Princip took in his life from his birthplace, ultimately to Sarajevo to shoot Franz Ferdinand. So the book is very much a travelogue, with the author providing details on Princip's life, correcting common misinformation, and providing background on the conflicts in Bosnia and Serbia in the 1990s, which he covered as a reporter. There's a lot of jumping around from the early 20th century, to the 1990s, and to today, which makes it confusing. It can also be slow-moving at times. Nonetheless, a worthwhile read, though not a great one.
