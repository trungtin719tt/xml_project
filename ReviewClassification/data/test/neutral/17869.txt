"There were these things to do."After being ambushed by a porcupine, bulldozed by a moose, ransacked by a tornado and ceaselessly blitzkrieged by mosquitos, chances are superlative that I'd have thrown in the towel and ceded Mother Nature its victory. Not so for Brian Robeson, who taps into unprovenanced reserves of resilience in the wake of each setback. Stranded following a crash landing in a remote stretch of forest south of the Canadian border, teenaged Brian must make do with little more than naked intuition and his trusty hatchet to survive.We've heard it said that necessity (and military advantage) is the mother of invention. It's what motivates Brian to try out turtle eggs and, I suspect, it's what led our ancestors to try their first sip of cow's milk. (Hello, lactase persistence!) Of all the godforsaken tribulations Brian faces, none weigh so heavily as the incessant dread of hunger, an enfeebling thrumming that is never truly quelled, only held in abeyance for a time. Meals that might have been considered inedible back home become a delicacy in the New Life of Brian.It wouldn't be much of a story if the only character in the book was mauled by a bear or succumbed to dehydration, so it is no spoiler to report that Brian, somehow, survives to tell the tale. The details are sparse and often skipped over with haste. Brian rallies and lives to fight another day (fifty-four of them, to be exact) seems to be the punchline. While young readers may draw inspiration from Paulsen's Bildungsroman, it's doubtful anything here will prepare you for actual survival in the wilderness, hatchet or no.Paulsen isn't a lyrical writer by any stretch, either, often using repetition of common themes and emotions to carry the narrative. I'd say this is the perfect summer read for a youngster within earshot of middle school; any older and the value of Paulsen's by-the-numbers tale drops off precipitously.Note:This review is republished from myofficial website.
