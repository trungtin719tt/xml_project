3.5 StarsA quiet town-Chester's Mill, Maine is trapped under an invisible dome. It catches the town off guard and causes planes to crash straight into it and will ultimately terrorize the community in more ways than one. This was my first book by King and enjoyed it, although it was over 1000 pages long with many characters to keep up with.Of course there is murder, plenty of creepiness and quite the cast of quirky characters. I was so intrigued by the invisible dome and all the images it provided. I read this with some reading buddies and we had so much fun trying to guess where the story was going and how it would end.Plenty of suspense sustains most of the story, although some of the side stories did feel unnecessary and slowed the momentum down. The ending was a bit disappointing to me (which I can't disclose because of spoilers) Now I can't wait to watch the television show and see how the characters are portrayed.
