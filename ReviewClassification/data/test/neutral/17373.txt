Actual Rating: 2.5 starsI enjoyed this one better than the first.I quite liked the end, however I think that the book would have had more impact without the epilogue.I prefer Julie Kagawa'sBlood of Eden series. To be fair, I am not that interested in The Fey fantasies, while I can't get enough of vampires.The Iron King (The Iron Fey #1)- 2 starsThe Iron Queen (The Iron Fey #3)- 1.5 starsThe Iron Knight (The Iron Fey #4)- 1 stars
