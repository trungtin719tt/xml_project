Book ReviewThe Taming of the Shrewis one ofWilliam Shakespeare's earliest plays and comedies, produced in the mid-1590s. We read this play in 8th or 9th grade as one of the introductions to Shakespeare in an English course. I'd rank this somewhere in the middle in terms of his comedies as well as works in general. It's got several funny moments (ironic humor) but it's also a bit weaker in terms of style and hidden meanings among all the words and characters. The plot is strong, and copied by many in the last 420+ years. Two men want to date / marry two women; sisters, brothers or friends, doesn't really matter. But only if both girls are married at the same time, thus forcing the hand where 1 man must step up and "take one for the team."Some argue the play is sexist. I won't debate that, only say it is over 400 years old and probably more forward-thinking than most others at the time. Not saying it's right or fair, tho. What does a man do when he agrees to marry the "shrewish" girl... especially when she won't have anything to do with him. Inject some humor, fiendish plot and sarcasm, of course. What makes this an interesting play is there is a lot of action and definition in the characters. There's enough to go around, unlike some of the other works where you can't quite tell which characters are important... and sometimes mix up a few. Much easier to stay focused here. But it's not as funny as you'd like it to be. I like plays with strong female characters. Katherine is strong but unfortunately has a few weak moments. And the ending doesn't fit for me.But... as far his plays go, definitely worth a read!About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.
