What would you do, if the person you loved woke up as a different person every single day??? Could you love them??? What would you make of their appearance?? Even if they didn't really have one???? These questions constantly arose while listening to this audiobook. Btw, if you sign up for an Audible 30 day free trialhere, you get afree audiobook!!!! I really questioned myself, my beliefs, and how I would act if I were in the same situation as Rhiannon and A. Thank you, David Levithan, for making me think so deeply!!!!! As for the actual book, I really didn't care that much about Rhiannon. I really enjoyed the book when she wasn't there. I felt like the fact that A woke up in a different body every single day and had to go about his/her life as normally as possible was super intriguingalready. Throwing a romance in the mix of this was a little bit too much for me. Personally, I think I would've enjoyed this more if this was a self discovery novel versus a romance. There is so much you can do with the lives you end up having to live and the lives you could possibly change by living in them for a day. I wish that there was more of this, because that was what I found most interesting and gripping.My rating system: (Idouse half stars.)5-I do not use the 5 star. Not because a book might not be worthy, but because a book is never perfect.4- Ilovedit! There weren't too many flaws, and I had no trouble getting through it. (A 4 star rating is the highest rating I've ever given a book.)3- Ienjoyedthe book, but there we're flaws that made me enjoy it less.2- Ifinishedthe book, but there were too many flaws for me to enjoy it.1- Icould not finishthe book, and I probably did not finish it....
