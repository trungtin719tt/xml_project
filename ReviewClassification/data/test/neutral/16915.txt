The first words that come to mind aredumb&amp;instalove.I've read worse (really, I have -- just recently, in fact :P). But I've read better. So...there you go.Part of the problem is how everyone talks &amp; acts like they're 7 instead of 17 (or 19, in other cases). The romance is schmoopy-lovey-dovey-eyes for no good reason other than the fact that it'sinstalove, &amp; therefore everyone should be on board with Bianca &amp; Lucas as a central pairing. Alas, Bianca &amp; Lucas are personality-challenged cyphers of imagined teenage wuv. Their instantaneous connection &amp; proclaimed adoration within 100 pages of large font is...well...unbelievable (not to mention nauseating), &amp; sets the stage for an endless repeat ofI love Lucas, Lucas is so beautiful, Lucas &amp; I are meant for each other, WTF is Lucas right now omg?!diatribes on Bianca's part. SNOOZE, PLZ.Another problem is the mash of vampirism &amp; Harry Potter. I do think the concept of the Evernight school is an interesting one (since vampires don't age when they've turned, their society has set up little havens where the younger-looking ones are disguised as boarding students &amp; can iron out any issues they have with modern technology, social structures, etc -- basically to help them blend in with normal folks). However, the slip-shodPotterinspiration is much too obvious &amp; results in extremely thin world-building populated with equally thin characters. That, combined with strung-together action scenes, cheesy dialogue, &amp; schmoopy mooncalf lurve, makes the entire book too unbelievable. It feels more like a middle grade novel than young adult; I'd probably have enjoyed it when I was 10, but not so much these days....That said, I did like this particular scene:"You've had a few minutes with the iPods now [said Mr Yee]. Your first questions?"Patrice raised her hand first. "You said that most electronic devices can establish wireless connections now. But it doesn't seem like this one does.""Very good, Patrice. This limitation is one of the few design flaws of the iPod. Subsequent models are likely to incorporate some form of wireless connection, and, of course, there's also the iPhone--which we'll cover next week." [...] "Anyone else?" Mr Yee looked around the room and then sighed. "Yes, Ranulf?""What spirits animate this box?""We've been over this." Putting his hands on Ranulf's desk, Mr Yee slowly said, "No spirits animate any of the machines we've studied in class. Or will study, moving forward. In fact, no spirits animate any machines at all. Is that finally clear?"Ranulf nodded slowly but didn't look convinced. He wore his brown hair in a bowl haircut and had an open, guileless face. After a moment, he ventured, "What about the spirits of the metal from which this box is made?"Mr Yee slumped, as if defeated.(Yes, I lol'd. I'm nothing if not easily amused.)2.5 stars, rounded up for Ranulf &amp; his confusion over iPods. :D
