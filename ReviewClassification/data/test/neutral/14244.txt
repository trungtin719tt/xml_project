This book is honestly fairly meh. The action is slightly lukewarm; in fact, nothing much happens for ages. The characters are nothing special. Lila and Doon are both flat as can be. In general, the book is just fairly meh.That being said, there's something fairly entertaining about this book. It's got that sweet emotional realness of so many middle grade books.I wouldn't read this as an adult, but for middle grade readers, this is definitely a solid read.
