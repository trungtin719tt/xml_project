3 "up and down like a toilet seat in a mixed gender dormitory bathroom" stars !!2015 Book Where I Wished I Was EditorAt 300 pages this book could have been a minor masterpiece.At 400 pages the book could have been excellent.Even at 500 pages the book had a likely chance of being very good.But at an astonishing 718 pages the book was overconfident in its own beauty, wisdom and dare I say its worthwhileness.I had four different experiences of reading this book:15% of it was absolutely sublime, profound, beautiful, profoundly beautifuly, beautifully sublime. You get the picture. There were moments when I was so choked with emotion that the boyfriend would pass me tissues as soon as he heard a sniffle. The loss of Theo's mother, his love of Hobie and Pippa, the comfort of the Goldfinch, the restrained desire for Boris and a few other emotional moments. These moments were poignant, heavy with gorgeousness and clearly unforgettable.50% was like watching an art house film by Gregg Araki mixed with reruns of Melrose Place. I know this sounds strange but this is exactly what this was like for me. Truly entertained but rather numbing and in the end extraneous.20% was gently trying to cajole Ms. Tartt (telepathically) to please cut out huge sections of the book that were superfluous, exhausting and unnecessary.15% siliently and sometimes not so silently cursing Ms. Tartt for the written diarrhea that one has to go through until you get to another one of those absolutely stunning sections that were written about above.Ms. Tartt when you are "on" you are "bang on" but please please please find another editor.
