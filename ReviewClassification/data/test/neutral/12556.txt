Before Tarzan there was Mowgli, lost in a jungle in India as a child and taken in by a family of wolves. He is raised by the animals of the jungle, and has adventures with them. He learns loyalty and devotion and the Jungle Law. Every small boy eventually grows up but, to pararphrase Kipling, his adult adventures are a different story. Written in 1894 and 1895 the two collections of adventure/jungle/wilderness stories are included in one volume. Mowgli and his stories are the vast majority, but there are other scenes and other stories included, such as "Rikki-Tikki-Tavi", about a small boy and his mongoose.As usual Disney took Mowgli's stories fromThe Jungle Booksand turned it into this cream-puff of a movie. Kipling's versions are a little darker as one might imagine, and have deeper undertones about the environment that are at best glazed over in the Disney cartoon.Not the best stuff I've read recently, but it's good to finally be able ot mark it off my list. I would have liked to have heard less about Mowgli (which is Disney's fault for the overkill factor) and more about the Artic region as in Kipling's story, "Quiquern".
