At the start of this book I was pretty sure it would be a 5* read. In the middle I was losing the will to read on and thought it would do well to wring 3* from me. By the end I give it a hearty 3* but just can't bring myself to offer 4.So, this is a vampire book without the sparkling, the forever sexy trope, or the stalker-horror vibe.Cronin's writing reminded me a lot of Stephen King, though with a more literary edge (which is not to say that King doesn't have a literary edge ... he does, and in many ways it's his popular success that blinds a lot of 'serious' readers to King's writing chops).Cronin writes very good prose. He is rather too wordy for my taste and spends too long getting around to things, but he writes some excellent lines and has a poet's sensibilities.The book comes in many sub divisions but for me it breaks into three main parts. First there is the pre-disaster section where we dive in great detail into the lives of a handful of protagonists while slowly bringing them together for the "vampire stuff". The amount of time spent on these individuals makes you sure that they are going to be the pillars of this story. Which makes it rather a shock when you suddenly leave them all behind and start off with an entirely new and larger set of characters far away in time and space.The second section, the colony, is where I started to lose interest. There were just so many characters and so few reasons for me to care about them. Additionally the point of view hops around between them regularly, which I found distancing and made it hard for me to attach to anyone.I found this section particularly wordy and slow moving. Cronin is using these people and their detailed individual stories to indirectly paint a larger picture of the world we find ourselves in ... I understand that. And if it had been half the length with the focus on half the characters I would have been much more taken with it.As it was it was a great relief when things started to go tits up and the roll call began to diminish rapidly.The third and final section is the quest, and here I found myself much more invested. The interest level started to climb along with the tension, and I was pleased with myself to have predicted the existence of something that I felt was the literary inheritor of "the new warren" from Watership Down.Even so, the pace was still sluggish and Cronin takes an age to get us anywhere.Some will say that this is a book about characters rather than plot, and that's fair enough. I like character driven stories. I like stories about characters. It's just that in this particular book I found the plot far more interesting than the characters.And finally, the book ends. But not with an great deal of resolution. It's very much a book 1 of a series (trilogy?). I can only think that some of the massive character building at the start of the book, that then vanished down a hole never to be spoken of again, may come to fruition in later books ... I'm looking at you Carter.So yeah... Strong literary writing, a great imagination, but just too very many multitudinous words, too slowly meanderingly point failing to get toingly ponderously paced for this particular reader.EDIT: And one small but crazy detail ... the only curse word they seem to own isfliers. I don't know if the editors were aiming for a PG rating but with so much time taken to build believable characters the dialogue seemed laughably clean and the appearance of "fliers" grew steadily more comical.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes..
