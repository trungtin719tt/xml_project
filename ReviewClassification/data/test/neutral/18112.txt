This fourth instalment of the Night Huntress series was a bit of a mixed bag. It was still a fast paced and engaging read with the same blend of action, romance, humor, mystery that we have grown to expect from the series. It even had plenty of shock twists and turns that kept things quite intense, but was also riddled with a few annoying flaws. Some of Bones and Cat's behaviour was infuriating and it felt like Frost had dipped into the well once too often with some of her story arcs.Cat and Bones are trying to relax after the happenings at the end of the third book when it becomes apparent that poor Cat has caught they eye of yet another ancient undead sex pest. Gregor "the dream snatcher" has been invading Cat's dreams(the guy treats bedtime with the same sort of creepy glee as Edward Cullen) and is claiming that Cat is actually his wife rather than Bones wife and that Mencheries wiped the whole experience from Cat's memory. Crazy happenings ensue as the "no means yes" former school girl snatcher tries to drag Cat kicking and screaming to his bed!The plot was a little far fetched, but would not have been too bad if I had not reached the stage where I'm getting bored by the fact that every vamp that meets Cat thinks she is the hottest girl on the planet and simply has to have her no matter what the cost. It is like there are no other women in this world!Another real irritation was the behaviour of both Cat and Bones. Bones was an asshole at times to Cat even stormed off in a drama laden huff at one point. Cat was even worse as her loose moral code hit an all time low in this instalment.Despite my moaning I did still manage to enjoy this. Frost managed to keep my attention as the story moved along at a rapid pace.Rating: 3.5 stars. It might have been 4 if it had less irritating moments.Audio Note: Tavia Gilbert was awesome as always.
