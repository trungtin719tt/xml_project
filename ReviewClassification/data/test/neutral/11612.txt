Click hereto watch a video review of this book on my channel,From Beginning to Bookend.The Haunting of Hill Houseis a slightly spooky read that follows four strangers into the depths of a haunted house with a mind of its own."No one knows, even, why some houses are called haunted.""What elsecouldyou call Hill House?" Luke demanded."Well - disturbed, perhaps. Leprous. Sick. Any of the popular euphemisms for insanity; a deranged house is a pretty conceit."What makesThe Haunting of Hill Housecompelling is the book's narrative voice:This house, which seemed somehow to have formed itself, flying together into its own powerful pattern under the hands of its builders, fitting itself into its own construction of lines and angles, reared its great head back against the sky without concession to humanity. It was a house without kindness, never meant to be lived in, not a fit place for people or for love or for hope.With skillful use of descriptive words, the author repeatedly invokes negative associations with places or objects that are otherwise mundane:[The room] had an unpleasantly high ceiling, and a narrow tiled fireplace which looked chill in spite of the fire which Luke had lighted at once; the chairs in which they sat were rounded and slippery, and the light coming through the colored beaded shades of the lamps sent shadows into the corners.As far as chilling elements are concerned, the book offers very little in the way of supernatural events.The Haunting of Hill Houseis more readily a psychological thriller than a ghost story. To say the book conveys the descent into madness is to use too scintillating a phrase to describe the plot. The effect of Hill House on the various characters evolve subtly, with infinitesimal shifts in their psyches.Though it moves at a moderate pace,The Haunting of Hill Houseis a beautifully crafted tale about the dark corridors and locked rooms in the unconscious mind.
