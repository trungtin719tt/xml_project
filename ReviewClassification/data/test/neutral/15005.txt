As a stand-alone Dan Brown book this one was interesting and did hold its own against Robert Langdon and his never ending series. 3.5 stars rounded down.Rachel Sexton handles data communications for national intelligence, her father is running for President against the corporation she helps run.A NASA discovery sets off a chain of events that rapidly spirals out of control.The book has a lot of technical jargon that made me switch off a little in the middle as my brain felt overwhelmed by the sheer amount of it. The chapters are also set from different perspectives; this was enjoyable but sometimes chapters were a page long and the book seemed to be a bit haphazard at times.Overall this was an enjoyable read, the twist at the end I never guessed.. I was vilifying completely the wrong character! The end really saved the book in my opinion as all the ulterior motives came out that were so nuanced before you barely noticed.
