Survivorfollows the well-known recipe that makes Palahniuk a writer with extraordinary insight. However, I didn't like it as much as the other ones of his I've read. I guess absurdities are part of what makes his novels great, completing a pattern which makes perfect sense through metaphors and witty implications. Only here, these absurdities were sort of detached from one another. Something went wrong and I missed the point which, inChokefor instance, made my hair stand on end. That's not to say I didn't likeSurvivor. On the contrary, if it was my first or second Palahniuk novel, it would most probably get my 4 stars hands down. Well, it's not, and the comparison withChokeandFight Clubis inevitable. 3 stars.
