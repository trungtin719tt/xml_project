I had to create a new shelf for this book as I couldn't put it on my literary fiction shelf as I don't believe people will be reading this book in a hundred (or even fifty) years time. &amp; it was too "heavy" to be categorised as chick lit.I hada lotof problems with this book.For one thing, it featured multiple points of view - which I'm not a fan of. At least it didn't go back &amp; forth in time as well.I was far more interested in Lusa's story than the other two - although my interest in Deanna's was high at the start, then faded &amp; Garnett's story was (finally) interesting at the finish. I'm a bit of a tree hugging, muesli munching, bone carving wearing greenie myself,* but found this book got more than a little "preachy" as it went on. For example;... "So? Who needs birds?""I do. You do."[redacted] "Not to mention, the rain would run straight down the mountain and take all the topsoil off my fields. The creek would be pure mud. This place would be a dead place."Chrys shrugged "Trees grow back""That's what you think. This forest took hundreds of years to get like this."&amp; on &amp; on &amp;on!Also a minor point but Deanna was supposed to have really beautiful, but amazingly long hair in the conditions she was living in?Yeah, right!&amp; endless stuff stuff about the minutiae in the character's life. Like, I just made plum jam, then plum chutney but didn't have enough plums to make plum sauce. Interested? Didn't think so. I think a good 50 pages could have been pruned off this book.While one part of the three characters meshing together really surprised me (&amp; was handled beautifully) others felt forced to tie everyone up a neat, tidy bow.Kingsolver writes well and does capture the sour disenchantment of Lusa's disintegrating marriage perfectly. Since she is my sister's favourite author I may try another one - but I'm not in any rush!* Phrase I always liked from a long ago NZ magazine - probably Metro.
