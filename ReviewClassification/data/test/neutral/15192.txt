I kind of feel tired after finishing this.I love Sarah Dessen. Even with her novels which I didn't particularly like or connected with, like this one, I still feel well and satisfied with her stories. Her writing is so good, her characters always really well developed and I love that she always has a family portrayal - even if one of the parents is absent, they are still a big part of the story.What happened here, I feel, is that Remy wasn't actually that well developed. We see her, we hear her but... we don't actually get to know her. Why is she the way she is? Why is she THAT salty and dismissive of her father if she never met him? Why is cynical to the point where it really starts to make the readers, like it happened with me, exhausted to read about her? And, if she's that cynical why is she constantly in relationships? Two months, two months, it's still longer than any relationship I've been in. Dexter got sucked into this mess and honestly I don't think he was treated properly even after she realized her mistakes. He just blindly accepted everything which made me really sad.The family portrayal and her relationship with her mom was the thing that kept me reading the most, the thing that sucked me into the story. Her mom is such a great character and I loved reading about the two of them together. Overall, a really nice summer read, but far from Dessen's best work in my opinion obviously.
