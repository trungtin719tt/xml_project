actual rating: 3.5/5 starsIt takes strength and courage to admit the truth.Plot:Well this one was interesting but i also found it very lacking in that i didn't connect with these characters or story in anyway which is disappointing. This story follows the two different perspectives of Sadie and Carter Kane who both living in different countries and different lives for them to come together when their dad is taken away from them.I did find it a little difficult at times to try and seperate the two main characters and have two different voices inside my head but it did help with Sadie growing up and living in England so the different language at times did help. One thing that really did stand out for me and in all of Rick's books is how much humour is such a massive part of how these characters interact and it's one thing that i love from these books.The Egyptian history and magic was all very interesting to me because i've never learned about this type of history and i'm glad that it was told in this type of story to make it enjoyable to read and also learn some new facts.Out of the two i think in this book Sadie was the one to shine out more on the page than Carter did and i know this book is setting up the next adventure so theres still time for me to get to know these two but i still stand by Sadie coming through more as the better character for this one.However there was just something that was missing from this book and i think it lasted all throughout the book for me, the first half of the book was a little slow and hard to get into but once things picked up i found my rhythm and got with the story. I did find the characters really harder to like going into this one and i'm not going to compare any of the characters from Percy Jackson or the Heroes of Olympus because all the characters are different and unique in their own ways however i just had trouble connecting to these characters and i have no idea why.Overall this story was enjoyable for the most part and i will continue with the rest of the series because towards the end is where i really started to get into this story so i'm hoping that book two picks up with a more stronger story.
