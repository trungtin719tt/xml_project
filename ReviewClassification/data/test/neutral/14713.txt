Okay, I'm giving this book four stars, not because of its literary prowess, but because of its enjoyability.However, after eight books in this series, I have a serious problem. Well, frankly I had a problem from the first book but I've already reviewed that one.My big problem is in the characters and the gender roles they embody. Now, there's been a great deal of criticism over J.R. Ward's treatment of female characters in these books. Xhex and Payne are like a bandaid she uses to patch this up.Now, honestly I am one of the few who actually always liked Xhex as a character. It didn't change in this book. John Matthews was always one of my most liked characters. Their show, in this book, was kind of stolen by Blay and Quinn who I found myself desperately hoping would have some kind of resolution for their relationship.As usual, J.R.Ward does what most romantic novelists do. She creates characters whose every problem can be fixed by love and great sex. I'm sorry but I was literally bashing my head on something very hard when Xhex, after being held prisoner for almost four weeks and brutally raped several times, had great sex with John Matthews. No. No. No.I'm not even going to go into that one except to say: No. To all future writers out there: Don't do it. That is just... I have no words for that one.However, the big problem with the characters wasn't that they weren't likable or interesting, or that the woman wasn't "equal" enough. It was the character roles they play. J.R. Ward doesn't seem to get this.In fact, I wonder if she'll ever get this. The complaints about poor female characters in her book don't necessitate the creation of female protagonists who are practically men with vaginas. Creating a female character who walks, talks, acts and thinks like a man doesn't create a positive female protagonist (especially when she spends so much time complaining about how weak women are)! Our issues weren't that your women were weak characters (okay, maybe a little bit) but the roles that define them for goodness sake!In this series the men are men and the women are there to be protected, cherished and ultimately invisible. The only, Only woman who appears repeatedly is Doc Jane and occasionally Ehlena because they need to stitch someone up. Why? As soon as they are married and happy with their partners do they suddenly become non-existent? Oh, sorry, they show up for the inevitable wedding at the end of each book and cry like babies.However, I get that you, J.R. Ward have been actively trying to give them varied professions and passions and hobbies to make up for the fact that Beth dropped her entire life to go play Queen with Wrath and for several books didn't appear to have anything to fucking do. I get that that's why there's now a doctor and a nurse and a counselor and and the director of a female's home etc. Now there is Xhex who will be fighting with the big boys. *Facepalms* I don't even know how to touch on this anymore without breaking out into cussing so inevitably varied and violent that my review will be removed by Goodreads...My biggest problem isn't actually the female gender roles that are fucked up in these books, believe it or not. It's the men's! The portrayal of masculinity in these books makes me want to cry. Studies have shown that whilst an appalling number of women will suffer from violence at the hands of men (25%), men are actually moreso the victims of violence at their own hands! 70% of men will, at one point or another, be the victim of violence against them. These books say that to be a man you have to be muscled to within an inch of your life and you must be violent. THIS DOESN'T HELP THE SITUTATION. Every male protagonist in this book is violent, animalistic, uncontrolled and hyper-masculine to the point of ridiculousness.Now, I'm not saying that I prefer the pansy-ass sparklepires over something that does more than brood in your general direction if you're evil. I'm just saying that there needs to be a more divergent representation of what it is to be male. Because frankly, masculinity is no more tied to the size of your muscles than femininity is to one's beauty.My challenge to J.R. Ward is not to create a female protagonist who embodies positive gender roles but to create a male protagonist that is still masculine and sexy despite the fact that he is not a muscleman who walked out of the caveman era. For goodness sake, in the reader's guide not a SINGLE male could list a book that they'd read that WASN'T a book that they'd read to Nalla. That's right. Every single male in the guide doesn't read except to a baby.And women must be gentle and protected and kept away. That is, unless they're a spitfire dead doctor who can't be harmed anyway or a woman with a mangina that can be seen from space.
