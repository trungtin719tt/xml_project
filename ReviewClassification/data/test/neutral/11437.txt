The thrill, suspense and excitement of the events in the Maze Runner turned several notches down in this book. But it is in this sequel that the readers learn the world outside of the maze- a world that is just as terrifying or even worse than that of the maze. New characters, twists in plots and character roles take place that give a new take on the story.
