Quick summation as this this series has been reviewed quite a bit.. I mean, c'mon.. there is a Starz show and its Outlander. Really. But I found it ok. I think I found the observations on the various Native American tribe life highly interesting. I think I spent too much of the book eye rolling at Brianna and in a state of constant irritation at her self importance and barreling into situations with said importance. (Seriously, lady.) You are not that important of a character and actually come off as an annoying gnat with little adding personality or value to the story, in my opinion. *ducks from serious Outlander die hard fans*
