The problem with the current vampire genre is that it's like emo kids. It takes itself VERY seriously, tries waaaaaaaay too hard and in the end looks all the same. Oh, and it's fun to laugh at.It wasn't that nightworld was bad. The writing flowed nicely, was descriptive and the world was well-realized. The characters were mostly interesting and different and all three stories stood well on their own as well as adding to each other.That's not to say, though, that I didn't have issues with this book.The third story, for me, really dragged and wasn't as good as the first two. In fact, all three stories gave me strong recollections of Gossip Girl and Vampire Diaries mixed together. Not that, you know, I've ever seen either show...Has anyone else noticed that Chuck Bass usually looks really pissy? I'm serious. I've never seen someone master that bratty, "I hope your head explodes from the sheer force of pissy that is emanating from my entire body right now" expression that he does.Anyway, back to the review...The one thing that really annoyed me about this book was the soulmate concept. In this book, one look is all it takes to see and recognize your soulmate, binding the two of you together in some kind of super powerful love that can probably conquer everything from the forces of darkness to paying for your phone bill.Sorry, folks. I just don't subscribe to that mentality. I certainly don't think I could fall in love like someone would fall into a ditch.
