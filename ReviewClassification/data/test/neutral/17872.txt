Found this (yup, ayoung readerbook) on the shelf a while back ... finally sat down to read it (a brief evening spent, the time went by quickly)... Both my offspring read it in school, although I don't remember which grades it was assigned... But I hadn't read it as a child. (OK, I was already an adult, indeed, already a practicing attorney, when it was first published....) I'd been meaning to read it for ages, and, now that I have, I'm glad I did.It's no secret it's a boy's coming-of-age survival saga. I can't say I understand how it became aclassic,or, for that matter, why it's assigned so frequently in schools. Maybe it's popular in urban schools, or maybe because fewer kids (boys?) grew up with scouting and basic survival training, so it seems exotic or foreign or.... I dunno. Part of me thinks that, given the amount of dystopian fiction that kids read these days, this would seem a bit tame.... I appreciate that the author has the protagonist recall (and rely on and reject) information gleaned from TV shows and movies ... but I guess I'm just assuming "kids today" are inundated with more of that kind of stuff, but, I dunno....Ultimately, it's hard to be objective about kid's literature - as adults, we're not the target audience. And we're heavily biased by what we read (and have experienced). For an analogous non-fiction plane crash solo survival epic, I couldn't get Norman Ollestad'sCrazy For the Stormout of my head. (Ollestad was 11 during his ordeal, the protagonist here is 13.) For pure epic drama, Joe Simpson'sTouching the Void,is far more harrowing, but, again, he's an adult, and the number of climbing disaster books, ranging from Krakauer'sInto Thin Airto Beck Weathers'Left for Deadshould be a genre unto themselves.... For making a life out of a survival epic on the edge of the earth, Rockwell Kent'sWildernessis remarkable, but of course, that's voluntary, and Kent is an adult. And, of course, military history is replete with extraordinary survival tales, but I digress.... This is something different, for a different readership...I've not read ... nor do I expect I'll get around to reading ... any of the sequels. (If I understand it correctly, one of the sequels is basically an alternative ending to this book....) But if theGoodreadscommunity tells me I'm missing something, I could be convinced pretty easily, because it didn't take very long to read this one...Anyway, now I've read it... and there's no more kids at home to read it... I'll be curious to see if, a generation from now, it's still considered popular....
