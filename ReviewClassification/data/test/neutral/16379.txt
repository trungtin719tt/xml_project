This book is one that I'm having a hard time rating. It's nothing to do with the fact that the book is written by two authors and I would split up the writing or anything like that. I found that their writing blended well together, and although I found one Will more fun to read about than another I don't think it had to do with the writing really. I've read many other reviews where people liked the other Will more so that doesn't really matter. It's just that although this book has the usual humor I have come to expect from John's books there was not much more than that to love about this book.Two boys named Will Grayson are both living in Chicago. At the start of the story they have no idea the other exists, but their paths are soon to cross. Will 1 is a straight teen with a very large gay best friend. This character is John Green's go-to guy. I've read about this same exact character now in three other John Green's books and that's why I didn't find this Will to be the most exciting or fresh character to read about. Will number 2 was written by David Levithan and he was a gay teen who is seemingly depressed, but becomes very hopeful when he finds out he's going to be able to meet his internet love, Isaac.I didn't really like any of the other characters. I guess if I had to pick any that were okay I would say Jane, but the rest were just annoying.The plot didn't have anything exciting happen, and I didn't get all emotional like I have when reading other John Green books. This book will probably be very unmemorable to be honest, but I thought it was an alright quick read. The book was seriously predictable, though. I mean pretty much from the start you can tell a few things are going to happen, but on the chance that someone didn't see them coming I will hide them.(view spoiler)[ 1. Of course we knew the only two gay guys were going to hook up. 2. It was also pretty obvious how things would end up for Will number 1 and Jane. It was also fairy obvious that "Isaac" wasn't going to work out because...well did ya read number 1? I will admit that even though I knew he wouldn't end up with "Isaac" I didn't think it would be who it was doing it all along, though.(hide spoiler)]And then we get to the ending. I almost didn't get to the ending after Tatiana here on GR warned that it was very "Glee"...So yeah. The musical. Wow. She was right. Very Glee or High School Musical. Over the top and unrealistic. I actually really like Glee, but it's fun on TV, not books. I'm sure there are some who may really like this book, but for me it was just okay.So yeah. This concludes my John Green reading for now. I wanted to read all of his books, and this was the final one for me. This experience has been all over the place.As far as Will Grayson, Will Grayson goes I would say it's much better than An Abundance of Katherines, but not as good as some others. This may just be because it's the last of his I'm reading and all of the similar main characters and road trips are leaving me feel like I need a change.
