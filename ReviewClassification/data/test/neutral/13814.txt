So, first of all, here is aquick review:Plot- it was rather interesting and there were some really action packed parts. On the other hand, I did not support some decisions made by Tally (even though I did understand them). It could have been much better. 3/5Characters- Tally has a totally new personality (which is always cool reading about), Shay is super crazy once again, David is a bae (even though there were AGAIN only few scenes featuring him) 4/5Romance- I guess the romance was there? Well, it certainly wasn't the main theme of the book and it didn't really go the way I thought it will. 3/5Writing- amazing once again (even with the annoying pretty talk.) 5/5The ending- as the final book in the series (I am not counting Extras into this), the end was more or less satisfying. 3,5/5I do believe that I don't have to go into details here because I said almost everything. But, I would like to give my opinion about Tally's decision to(view spoiler)[ stay a special. As I earlier mentioned, I did understand why she wanted to do that. She was sick of people messing with her brain for the third time now, but I really believed that she would want to return to her old self and to her old looks. She was cured, she got control over her brain back, but I think that she didn't understand that being an ugly isn't ugly. That it's human and that there is really nothing wrong with that. But did the message of this story get through to her? I didn't get the feeling like it did and that for sure is my main issue with this book.(hide spoiler)]That's it people. Thanks for reading!
