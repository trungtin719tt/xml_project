I'm still trying to figure out what the ultimate take away from this novel is.So far it's Brazillian's have a lot of superstitions and eleven minutes is the average?It's refreshing to have a work by Paulo Coelho that isn't anything spiritual and have more realistic, relatable characters that experience actual challenges in sex work.I mean... it was alright.3.4/5
