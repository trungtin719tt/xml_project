Wertherwas in love withLotte. She was already engaged. Werther persisted. Lotte married her fiance,Albert. Werther killed himself.THE END.That in essence is what this classic unrequited love story is all about. Originally written in German and first published in 1774, this book is an important novel of theSturm und Drangperiod in German literature. Sturm und Drang is that period in Germany in 1760s to 1780s when extreme emotions as expression became popular in reaction to restrictions imposed in literature and music during the Age of Enlightenment. This age was the era in Western philosophy where reason (and not emotion) was advocated as the primary source and legitimacy of authority (Source: Wiki).Due to this novel, Mr. Goethe became one of the first international literary celebrities. He was like a rebel opposing the trend. What a smart guy!No wonder this book is included in the 501 Must Read Books and 1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die (in all the versions: 2006, 2008 and 2010). Though with a simple flimsy plot, it was written at the right time.If I were on my teens, I could have rated this book 5 stars. I am not saying that I am past my romantic years. I can still be amorous and I know I still have my charm (duh). However, killing myself for somebody because of love is or was or will always be pathetic. Why?Mr. Goethe, the smart celebrity, gave a hint with this line spoken by Lotte on the night prior to Werther's suicide (page 108):"Think calmly, Werther," she said, "for just one moment. Don't you see that you are deceiving and ruining yourself on purpose? Why me, Werther? Why me of all people, who belongs to another? Why? I fear ... I fear that it is just the impossibility of possessing me that makes your desire for me so fascinating."That's right. In the story, Werther is a rich kid. He has his own servant and maid. He doles out money to poor children. He does whatever he wants and he does not work. He is bored. Takes fancy on a beautiful lady, the eldest of 6 kids who are all recently orphaned because their mother died (father died ahead of the mother). He likes being with children as he is also childlike in so many ways. Lotte only likes his serenity and reliability (page 111) and does not feel other kind of attraction to him.If Werther were a Filipino living in one of the slums, he would not have killed himself. If he were a good-looking as Villar (when he was young), he would court a rich girl, go into real estate, have a political career and run for president.Well, try again in 2016, hmmm better not.But I still like this book. Who are we to be cynical about love? Young people can be too passionate about their feelings and it is part of being young. It must be the raging hormones. They have the right to be stupid and senseless. It will only be later, when they look back and smile on their stupidity. But all of us have gone through that, right?
