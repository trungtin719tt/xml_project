Okay, nothing new about this story is there?This is a piece of classic science fiction or adventure fiction, if you prefer. It's actually what I remembered. I've rated it five stars, but it's important to note, that five stars comes because of what this novel started.This is the birth of steampunk and science fantasy. This is the book that most people point to, not that there aren't others, as one of the earliest purely science fiction stories. And, more importantly, this is loaded with hard science. Some of the conclusions are wrong, but from start to finish this is one scientific observation after another. Even when the Nautilus runs aground in a narrow straight, Captain Nemo computes the exact time that they'll come free based on a myriad of factors, every one of which grounded in scientific principle, from the factoring in the moon, to the salinity of the water and some fairly anal retentive compulsive details. For those interested, other than some things he might not have ever known, his story of travel in a submarine, given it's a fairly luxurious submarine, is actually reasonably accurate compared to modern times.Verne wrote about the travels under the sea as if it was a travel book chronicling a rather strange vacation to exotic lands in the tradition of the times he lived. Through the course of the book, no ocean goes unexplored. The Nautilus even makes its way under each polar ice cap. All the while, the narrator, gives us a species by species list of every fish known to man, and some never before seen.It's this meticulous attention to detail that seems to serve as a blueprint for modern science fiction. Verne's detailed catalog of the sea included mythical creatures like the famous Giant Squids, or devil fish, and what may have been the last saltwater manatee. It may not be as much the detail after detail of sea life, as the very idea of a ship that could survive underwater, powered by steam and coal which runs a dynamo that charges a battery, that is so amazing.There is no ego, super-ego an Id, no jungish collective unconscious or other symbolism. There is no analogous story buried under the surface. With Verne, it's what you read is what you get. He pays more respect to the power of nature, though his methods are ultimately barbaric but they were common practice at the time. It likely seems hypocritical for his iconic proffesorio to inspect his fish as they are pulled out of the nets while clearly casting a sympathetic nod to the need to protect the oceans from man's encroaching touch.As for characters. The Nautilus served as a character all it's own, that was as strange and unyielding as her Captain. Of the human variety, the professor served as our narrator. At first he seemed too caught up in science and the enamored of Nemo to be remarkable. Then, as a sign that Verne really had some skill on display between the covers of this book, the professor became more human as time passed. The professor became more and more enamored of Nemo, and impressed and amazed by the Nautilus he even seemed to argue with himself over his attachments. Then, upon finally seeing irrefutable proof that Nemo had a dark side that rivals Darth Vader, we get no more of the monotonous details.Ned Land was enjoyable and even provided some comic relief, though not nearly enough. The consummate man's man and nay-sayer. Conseil ... this guy needed a girlfriend. Only on rare occasions did he show any personality. This is Spok to Ned Land's Kirk.The bottom line for me is that, despite the problems with monotonousness detail, for the late 1800s this book required some very creative and imaginative thinking. It laid the ground work for what we now call "hard science fiction" and for that all of us who love science fiction should celebrate this. I might also say that by most modern definitions, this story is steampunk, and very likely one of the earliest steam punk novels that has all of the parts.Thank you Mr. Verne.
