I wouldn't recommend this book to just anyone because of it' explicit sexual content. It's about a young women who falls in love and then is heart broken over and over again every time she falls in love. So she decided not to fall in love. She becomes a prostitute and makes good money and never falls in love with any of her clients. She finally meets an artist that is drawn to her, he knows what she does and yet wants her to teach him to find love again. They discover it together. It has a happy ending but, it's not the type of story you hear about. It's based on true events. There is one part in the book that I particularly liked, "I have reached the conclusion that sex has come to be used as some kind of drug: in order to escape reality, to forget about problems, to relax. And like all drugs, this is a harmful and destructive practice. If a person wants to take drugs, in the form of sex or whatever, that's their problem; the consequences of their actions will be better or worse depending on the choices they make. But if we are talking in terms of making progress in life, we must understand that 'good enough' is very different from 'best.'" I think in today's world sex is getting to familiar with all of us. We need to make it sacred again.
