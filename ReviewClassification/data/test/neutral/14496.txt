Started off a little slow, maybe because he spent so much time introducing the characters. It just got a little old and before I knew it I was 1/2 way through the book and not much had happened. But good thing you don't read the beginning last.I did like the story, I'm a sap for romance, I loved the character Logan.On a side note I couldn't get past some of the writing. For being such a famous author I would think they would use spell check or something before they published it. (Ex. finally was fnally). They even spelled one of the main characters wrong (Clayton was Cayton). And maybe I don't know enough about writing, but there was a phrase used that didn't seem to fit in the spot it was used. 'It was all Thibault could do not to laugh'. I get what it is saying here, I understand the phrase, but what is "it"? Any English majors out there? Ok I'm dumb for thinking way too much into this.I liked the book. Period.
