Third Read: August 2016Second Read: 2009Original Read: 20023.5 STARSI *still* have not read Sisterhood Everlasting so I'm going to reread the first four books (yet again) so I can finally finish off this series. I'm going the audio route this time around and the thing that I keep noticing is how different the movie was from the book. It's been so long since I read the books that I forgot how much they condensed into the first movie and how many changes they made.This is still an enjoyable read after all these years and it's fun to revisit the four friends.
