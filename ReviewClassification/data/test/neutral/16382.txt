I really liked the idea of this book, having two authors create a character each and alternate their points of view throughout the novel. For me it was an entirely different kind of experience and the two authors have such unique styles that I would say it is definitely something everyone should read. It's a story about two teenage boys, both of which are called Will Grayson. They could hardly be more different, there lives have almost nothing in common... until one night when circumstances lead to them meeting by accident (in a porn shop). It's funny and it's ridiculous.So why the average rating?Well, because I couldn't get interested in John Green's character at all I'm afraid. This is my first experience of his writing and I know him to be a very highly rated and acclaimed author, one whose books have tempted me numerous times at my local library but I've never got around to reading. If this is any indication, I'm not sure his novels would be for me. I found his Will Grayson boring and a character who quickly became secondary to more interesting personalities like Tiny. I'm also yet to find a young adult novel that does the beauty and the geek story well. Will Grayson is an awkward, nerdy guy who can't believe the smart and beautiful Jane would fall for him. And neither can I, I'm sorry.That being said, David Levithan's character rocked. He's an angsty "I hate the world" type of guy and it's just effin' hilarious. One of my favourite parts is the part near the beginning where he's having a rant about people using things like "lol" on the internet:"or ttyl. bitch, you're not actuallytalking. that would require actualvocal contact. or &lt;3. you think that looks like a heart? if you do, that's only because you've never seen a scrotum.rofl! what? are you really rolling on the floor laughing? well, please stay down there a sec whileI KICK YOUR ASS"I really really liked Levithan's humour. In fact, I just really like him as an author, I'm yet to be disappointed by his writing. Perhaps I would have liked Green's character better if I didn't have this to compare it to but Green's Will Grayson just pales in comparison.Some people didn't like the musical at the end but I thought it was pretty funny. I've known a few versions of Tiny in real life - big personality, outrageously shameless - and his character repeatedly made me smile (credit to John Green there). On the whole, the novel was a pleasure to read: very entertaining, very gay (no offense intended in any way - read the novel and see what I mean) and very different.
