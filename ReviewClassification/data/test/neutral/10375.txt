[3.5]What a ride, jesus.I'm so glad there's more coming out now. I need more of Aaron and Juliette. More growth. More character development. I want to see them conquer the world, now that they're a powerful couple and all.This was definitely my favourite book in the series.---------------------------Initial thoughts:This had better include countless amount of heart-wrenching and hot scenes between Juliette and fuckin Aaron, because I do not care for the plot.Seriously, why is his name so yum though?!
