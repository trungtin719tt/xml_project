1/8/2014 UPDATEI finished this freakin book! YES, I read it all on my third attempt! I feel f*cking proud right now!The most weird thing is that I didn't hate it. You would think that since I'd already tried the book 2 times and couldn't finish it either of them I would hate it. But I didn't. The writing was decent, the characters interesting if not exactly mind-blowing and the plot pretty original for its genre.And I will admit here that I read it mostly because I've watched the show and I liked it. I have a thing for crappy TV-shows, don't judge.I don't think I'll be reading the second any time soon but just the fact that I finished this makes me really happy! I'll up my rating to 2.5.18/2/2014 UPDATEOf all the awesome PNR and UF series out there this is the one that gets to turn into a TV show??
