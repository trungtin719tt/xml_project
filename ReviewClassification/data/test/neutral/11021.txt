Actually, I really like this book--I just don't think "It's Amazing" even though I have read it three times. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good read in historical fiction, who is interested in US history and, especially, the Civil War. Shaara does a good job of sketching the tenor of the times, the sentimentality and the conflicted feelings of the men. It's a terrific book for high school students who might otherwise find the history aspect less than compelling.My Civil War buff friends criticize this book for several inaccuracies, but nitpickers &amp; enthusiasts will always do that, and remember--it IS fiction, though well-researched and based on historical events. I think Shaara does a wonderful job with Lee and Chamberlain especially...as characters. That's one reason the movie "Gettysburg" is a good script as drawn from this book--there are actual characters (not historical autobiographies).Why have I read this book so often? Well, I read it once. Then my kids had to read it in high school, so I re-read it then because they wanted to talk about it. Then I read it again for a historical fiction book discussion group.It's held up to all those readings, as a novel at any rate.
