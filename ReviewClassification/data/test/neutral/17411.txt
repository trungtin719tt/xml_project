Find all of my reviews at:http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/3.5 StarsAre you looking for a book with a plotline a little something like this????If so,House of Leavesmight be right up your alley.The simple synopsis (and the only one you're going to get from me) is this is the story of Will, Karen, and their dream home, told through various narrators.I readHouse of Leavesbefore I started "writing" (a/k/a imaging) reviews. I don't make a habit of going back and posting something for a previously read novel, but occasionally I make an exception.House of Leavesis a book that deserves a review - mainly to justify the 3.5 Star rating.To begin, reading this book is a daunting task. If anyone ever tries to tell you thatHouse of Leaveswas such an "easy read" you should immediately never talk to them again because they arehugeliars. I'm not going to bullshit you. I mean, just look at a sample of what you're expected to wade through . . .Simple, right? Yeah, notsamuch. Looky here . . .Wait, it gets evenworsebetter . . .The worst part is after all of the flipping and turning around of the book and wading throughgazillionsof footnotes and endnotes and probably banging your head against the wall more than once, you might be like me and find yourself left feeling a bit unfulfilled (or find that you found half of the story to be worthy of 5 Stars while the other half ranked a 2.5, at best). However, I thinkHouse of Leavesis one of those books thatEVERYONEshould attempt and I wish it would pop up on more of those "100 Books to Read Before You Croak" lists.It's very rare that I have this type of reaction to a "scary" (kinda? sometimes???) story . . .But that house. Good godamighty that house!
