hmmm.. I guess if you haven't read Percy Jackson, you'll definitely LOVE this book! It is enjoying to read! Rick Riordan is absolutely humorous! Writing in two different perspectives is really not easy, so thumbs up to him for that!BUT! there's just a few 'but's since i'm an avid fan of Percy Jackson. i didn't quite enjoy it as i thought i would. it's just waaaay too similar to percy jackson. like percy jackson, they're also looking for children with pharaoh blood and everything. and like percy, the main characters carter and sadie lived in the shadow all throughout their lives but found out the truth later on when they have to save the world from Set.BUT again, i still loved the book. It's interesting since it involves Egyptian gods and goddesses and their rich culture. Ancient Egyptian culture had always intrigued me when I was young and it is great to find a book about it, even greater to know that Rick Riordan's the author. I learned a lot in reading this book. It IS a good book on its own. I absolutely recommend it especially if you haven't read Percy Jackson yet.although it's just my opinion. :)
