There is a dark undercurrent in this novel and in this character that I found disturbing. And a few of the other characters that you encounter I would describe as bizarre, like the old gingerbread lady, and the King Cobra at the zoo who likes to kiss your cheeks (no thank you). The movie, I understand, is different (I haven't seen it). As classic children novels go this one, for me, was not very likable, so three stars is the best I can do.
