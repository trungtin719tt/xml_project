I struggled between three and four stars, ultimately deciding on three as I think a bit more could have been diced into the plot to make it more exciting. A good story, unique and I dug the simplicities of it. The dog was awesome and he and the Outsider, by far, the best characters of the book. I liked everyone, but as I said in a status update (sort-of), Koontz is more of a plot guy rather than a character one. His strength is in the story, which is cool, but sometimes his characterization skills seems a little unrealistic to me, especially when it comes to romantic relationships. He always did write villains exceptionally well, though, and the hitman was interestingly complex.It was never boring as something was always going on, but for the most part little was seen of the big bads and most of it was on the relationship trio dynamic between Travis, Nora, and Einstein (the dog). How sweet and funny that dog was. I read a joke the other day that since this book Koontz seems to enjoy injecting a dog into almost all the romantic relationships in further books, and it does work well here. The ending was the shining area of the story, especially the last scene with the Outsider. Would have enjoyed more scenes with him and the psychological imbalances.Overall recommended, Koontz fans should love it. For suspense fans looking for a thrill, may be better to have this one on the backburner for when in the mood for a more drama-laden story.
