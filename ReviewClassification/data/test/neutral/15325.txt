From Dead to Worse3 StarsHarris's world building is fascinating and Sookie is a delightful and down-to-earth heroine. Nevertheless, something is missing from this installment perhaps because it is a bridging book with the storyline moving in a new and completely different direction.Plot threads from previous books are wrapped up quickly with well-established characters disappearing, and new people and elements are introduced. Shaking things up is not necessarily a negative, but not all of the issues are resolved satisfactorily.Sookie's love life is on hiatus although the men in her life still can't seem to let go. Eric's memories of his time with Sookie return; Bill, the scumbag, is determined to win her back; Sam seems incapable of expressing his true feelings, Alcide has be regulated to "friend of the Sookie status", and Quinn is MIA.In sum, it will be interesting to see where Harris is going with the new focus, but she definitely needs to liven things up soon.
