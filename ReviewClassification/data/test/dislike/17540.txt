I'm sorry, but I've had just about enough of HoN. Zoey annoys me, the way they write Stevie Rae's accent ticks me off (I'm a Southern Girl), Kramisha sounds uneducated (we know she is educated) and the way the Casts portray Jack and Damien suggests that they've never actually met any gay men. I swore I wouldn't read any more of this series after reading the 7th book, but I read this one because I had invested too much time in the series. I wish I would have stuck to my original plan. One of the few good things in this book is that Zoey only had one boyfriend this time, but I cannot understand the Casts' obsession with Heath. I can't stand Heath and I was so happy when they killed him off. Why couldn't they let him stay dead??? I like Stark. I've always liked Stark. Zoey should be with Stark. Now they've foreshadowed him becoming "evil". Also, I am so tired of reading "bullpoopies", "heehees" and "I heart me some...". Aphrodite is the only good thing about HoN, but she's not enough to keep me interested in reading any more of these. So, to the Casts: you should have stopped three or four books ago. HoN has officially exceeded stupid and 12 of these horrific installments is beyond the definition of the word "overkill".
