7.0/10I do love me some melodrama -- I really do -- and sometimes one just savours it.But there are times when you just toss the book back into the library slot, and Pffft! like a bad dream, it's already forgotten, except for a faint echo of the doom-and-gloom wintery landscape.I'm being completely irreverent, I realize, when I suggest a better name for Ethan might have been Eeyore, and so I bow with humility in the face of all those who loved and lost -- and raved about Ethan. But. My. God.While I understand, very well, that the forces that shape us are often unseen and unexpected; that our lives hang by Fates more often than they hang by our own design, in this instance Wharton failed her character completely; or conversely he failed her. I don't think Wharton had enough of a grasp of the Fromes of the world -- she was just one second behind the beat, at every turn: just couldn't synchronize true poverty and despair with anguish and defeat, for the life of her. She might have understood the anguish of the "rich and famous", but she's a step behind on that "poverty thing."The novel sounds so hopelessly contrived, that I'm surprised I'm giving her such a high rating.I think the language moved me -- the language of landscape, that is: for that, Wharton has a keen eye, deep appreciation and true understanding.As for Eeyore, ahem ... Ethan ... there are straw scarecrows with more backbone and substance.To marry someone because she was ...there?? Obviously, Ethan left all the wit he had back at Worcester college where he studied; and so it seems to me this book would be better termed Just Desserts.He's not a sympathetic character for me because he bears the signs of a creature observed, and painted, rather than of someone whom oneknowsand understands.Perhaps unwittingly, Wharton herself avows this approach to the novel. In discussing her work with Daniel Berkeley Updike, from Merrymount Press, Wharton said to him:One wintry autumn afternoon we were driving in the country near Lenox, and on the top of a hill on the left of the road stood a battered two-story house, unpainted, with a neglected door-yard tenanted by hens and chickens and a few bedraggled children sitting on the stone steps before the door. 'It is about a place like that,' said Mrs. Wharton, 'that I mean to write a story.' Only last week I went to the village meeting-house [church] and sat there for an hour alone, trying to think what such lives would be and some day I shall write a book about it.'Sat there for an hour.I've given more thought to this review than she gave to the likes of Frome.Unfair on my part? Undoubtedly.Still ... it's the kind of thing that we pick up on, and nit pick, a century after the fact. But it's not completely unwarranted on my part.While writers glean inspiration from everything in life, it feels much too contrived to me, to sit and "observe a population", like ascientistand then try to deliver amoraltale on the subject. It seems to me that two disparate forces are at play, and that's probably why this doesn't work for me. It's jarring. It's inauthentic.I read Wharton's own marital debacle, in this novel, more than I read a true portrait of Ethan. Zeenia seems to be an exorcism of Teddy Wharton, her hubby, who suffered from horrific depression; was more than a little bit of a cad even when he was sane; and, ultimately, in the nut-house department would have given even Mrs. Rochester a run for her money.Frome is weak and lazily sketched;Zeenia,Xenophobia,Zenobia* is a caricature (even if not a downright literary assassination) of her hubby; and Mattie is barely a ghost in all of this, representing Ethan's ephemeral longing for a last hurrah for freedom. Even in this, he proves to be rather spineless -- but in the end manages only to damage Mattie's spine. What (silly, silly) irony!And so, to wrap up this review like a proper grammar-school essay, "I like Wharton quite a bit when she sticks to things she knows something about."* Wikipedia tells me:Zenobia was a cultured monarch and fostered an intellectual environment in her court, which was open to scholars and philosophers. She was tolerant toward her subjects and protected religious minorities. The queen maintained a stable administration which governed a multicultural multiethnic empire. Zenobia died after 274, and many tales have been recorded about her fate. Her rise and fall have inspired historians, artists and novelists, and she is a patriotic symbol in Syria.Huh. Who knew?!In this delicious irony, maybe it's the one point Wharton got right.
