Ahh! Illusions was boring, repetitive, and pretentious. Because he was trying so hard to be meaningful, Richard Bach forgot to write an engaging plot, and the message he was trying so hard to convey seemed trite. This book came into my possession because my school library no longer wanted it. Now I know why. I finished it only because it was so short, but I feel that it was still a waste of my time.
