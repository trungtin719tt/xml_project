I wanted to read this, the second book in the Earth Children series, because I enjoyed the first book in the series. Unfortunately, this book has quite a bit of pornish/explicit stuff in it that I ended up just skipping over to get to the end...However, there were a couple of passages that I loved:p. 459: "You beautiful, wild, wonderful woman!"p. 501: "You are strong, self-reliant, entirely able to take care of yourself and of me... You are fearless, courageous; you saved my life, nursed me back to health, hunted for my food, provided for my comfort. You don't need me. Yet you make me want to protect you, watch over you, make sure no harm comes to you. I could live with you all my life and never really know you; you have depths it would take many lifetimes to explore. You are wise and ancient... and as fresh and young as a woman as... And you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen. I love you more than life itself."Would love to hear those words from a suitable suitor some day - maybe!
