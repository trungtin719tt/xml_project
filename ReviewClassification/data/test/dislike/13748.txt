I loved the movie. Don't get me wrong, the film adaption is one of my favorite movies of all time- that's precisely why I wanted to give the book a try, because the book's always better than the movie, right? Well, this was the exception. Because 'Forrest Gump' is manipulative, outrageous, poorly characterized, and awkwardly written. I read an article once that said that the only reason there wasn't a film sequel to 'Forrest Gump' was because the author didn't get enough credit for writing the book- well, I now have a new appreciation for Hollywood screenwriters, because the one who scribed the movie did a monumental job. There are many reasons why I hate this book-1. It insults the reader's intelligence, as well as the characters. In the book, Forrest is portrayed as a grown man with the brain of a four-year old. In the movie, it's established that he has mental deficiencies, but that was the message of the film- that he still had a heart. It's a tad maudlin, but still a good resolution. In the book, he's seriously drawn as stupid. The supporting characters and their interactions with Forrest are poorly drawn- it's also a very perverse book, which I don't mind, if placed properly, but the author obviously doesn't know how to control a genre. It insults people with conditions similar to Forrest's, considering the way he is poorly portrayed.2. It's outrageously awkward. I was a bit horrified to read about Forrest going into the boxing ring wearing a diaper- there were also a few other scenes I'd rather not go into in case someone actually wants to give this book a stab.3.There's no character growth. The characters come to now resolution. Even the cleverly placed war-backdrop and political unrest in Forrest Gump is gone.4. The author has a twisted sense of comedy- and not in the funny, Judd Apatow way. Forrest just comments on things at the oddest of times. Also, the author doesn't know when things should be implied- I thought that was one of the greatest adaptive qualities of the movie. It managed to be subtle in its developments, which played a contrast to Forrest's perspective, enabling the film with stronger overall narrative power.I might get a lot of hate from people who loved the movie and stand by the book but never even read it. But trust me, I'm just as disappointed as you are. This may actually be the only book I've ever given one star to. Reading this gave me more appreciation for the film making industry- don't worry, though, I'm sure it'll be gone tomorrow when I hear about another vampire novel getting a million-dollar movie deal.
