Having absolutely loved Atwood's "A Handmaid's Tale," I decided to try out "The Blind Assassin."Verdict? It was... okay. The writing was really great, but everything else kind of bored me -- the characters, the plot, the novel within the novel within the novel. By the time the book worked itself up to its climax, I had long since lost interest. I was just trying to plod through and finish the thing.At times, I was more eager to find out what happened to the blind assassin and the girl without a tongue in the sacrificial temple than I was to find out what was really going on between the Chase sisters. While I found Atwood's passages about old age and mortality touchingly beautiful, I also found them repetitive.Yawn. This book took me over a week to finish. That's evidence of something... I'm not giving up on Atwood, but this one was a C+, at best, just for boring me.
