*******Spoilers ahead******InPretties, we once again catch up with our heroine extraordinaire, Tally. Tally has now had the pretty making surgery and is drop dead gorgeous. But being pretty isn't enough for Tally. She wants to be in a special pretty group called the Crims. She and Shay are back in BFF land and all is well with the world.Tally also meets Zane and insta-love is formed. I guess it was insta-love but, again, I didn't see any chemistry at all. All thoughts of David are out the window now that Tally has Pretty brain. Zane is also conveniently the leader of the Crims. He also knows something is wrong with Pretty brain! For some bizarre reason starving himself makes his mind clearer. Um, ooookay.One of The Smoke show up and direct Tally to a place where some pills are hidden to get rid of the lesions in her brain that are controlling her. Tally is too chicken shit to take the pills, so she and Zane split them.To make a long boring-ass story short, Zane and Tally decide to run away from New Pretty Town and join The Smoke. Zane has been having some bad effects from the pill and needs help. They hijack some hot air balloons, leave the city, then are supposed to jump out in a certain location. Brilliant. Of course, Tally doesn't jump at the right spot and she winds up in an area that contains some backward-ass tribes killing each other. Page filler, anyone?They finally reconvene at The Smoke's new location where Tally sees David once again. In her mind he is completely ugly and she is a total bitch. I mean, honestly, I have never hated a character as much as this one. Not one redeeming quality. At all.Somehow a beacon is triggered and The Smoke once again is going to get invaded by Special Circumstances. But, HOW??? Ahhhhhh, the smart doctors in the city planted a device in Zane's tooth! How genius! They have also attached it to his bone so that even David's doctor mom cannot remove it. Tally, decides to stay with Zane, which means getting carted back to New Pretty Town. Sound familiar?One thing I must note about this book that irked me to no fucking end was the Pretty language. Some examples:Milli-Helens (the fuck that means I have no idea).Bubbly.The cutesie tootsie nicknames like Tally-wa and Shay-la.Brain spinning.And, last but not least, my personal favorite.BOGUS.Where the fuck were Bill and Ted?1 Ninja-Bunneh
