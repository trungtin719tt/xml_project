This is probably the strangest book I've ever read. I didn't like it very much.Ellis seems to be unable to make up his mind as to what the book's story is about - it starts off depicting his earlier life (sex, drugs, booze, more sex and drugs) before it drifts over into an alcoholic trying to bond with his son, then suddenly things are possessed, the house is haunted, there is someone abducting young boys, a serial killer is on the loose, his marriage is falling apart, his son hates him, he's being stalked, and then the monsters arrive.A talented author could have made it work, but either Ellis just... isn't, or this is one of his low points. Everything seems mashed together, fragmented, like Ellis kept on visiting the NaNoWriMo forums looking for ways to kick-start his plot. Actually, that's what it read like - a car that keeps on dying, but the owner just won't let it go in peace.The only vaguely interesting bits were the scenes involving the Terby or the hair monster, but that's simply because by that time I was starved for ANYTHING that would grasp my attention. The book starts off by making so many references to drugs and sex that I'm afraid I'll catch an STD simply bytouchingit, and then it bores me silly for three hundred pages until expert of all things supernatural Bob Miller (and his sidekicks Sam and Dale) arrive with their EMFs and I could pretend I was readingSupernaturalfanficton instead.Lastly, a possessed not-toy crawls in through the family dog's anus and takes possession of its body, turning it into a werewolf-like thing with wings.Yes, it's one ofthosebooks.
