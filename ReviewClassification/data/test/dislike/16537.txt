DNF at 55%Yoo hoo! You know what this is? This is me abandoning the fourth book in the Dark Tower series:Well,metaphorically.It is so frustrating to feel myself forced to abandon this book, especially since things were getting better in the previous one. You see, I thought book 1 was okay, 2 was better, but book 3 was great. I really liked it, so I expected this one to be better, or at least as good as the other ones had been. But no, it was bad.See, the thing is that after the horrible cliffhanger in book 3, I expected lots of intense scenes and continuing with their quest, but instead we got Roland's backstory.If it were a character I like, I don't think I'd be bothered a lot. The problem here, though, is that Roland is my least favourite character, and that's because he's so stiff and boring. I didn't give a damn about his past.Again, if the backstory was intriguing, I wouldn't have been so bothered,but againit was a fail. Why?Because romance.Yeah, so we go from a crazy talking train and riddles to... kisses and blushes.Not a good change, is it?Aaaaand again, a romance wouldn't have bothered me that much if 1) it hadn't been so cheesy, 2) if that was what I wanted, and 3) if the whole book (or rather what I managed to read) didn't feel as if King had no clue as to what to write. Like... yeah, I want this to be an epic fantasy quest, but I don't know what to do with my characters now so I'll just write a flashback while something comes to my mind.It's so annoying, and now thanks to that I'm doing something that may appear outrageous:I'm DNFing this, but I will continue the series.Maybe important things happen in this book, but a summary from Wikipedia is what will save me from total confusion if something from this book is mentioned later.Now I'll just say it's a pity so many pages were wasted in an unnecessary and eye-roll worthy romance and hope book 5 finally picks up the story with the rest of the characters I actually like, because I really miss Eddie, Jake and Susannah (and Oy too).
