Where to begin? I heard great things about this but I should have stayed away.VioletI feel like she only really existed here to be the emotional component of this book. She's used as a prop mostly and a prize, yet I never saw her as having any personality beyond just being a sounding board. There is plenty ofwoe is me/my sister died so I use that as an excuse to hide from lifefrom this character. She just felt insubstantial to me, her only purpose being to tell the readers about the emotional weight of the tragedies around her.FinchI know people are going to hate me for this, but I was so annoyed by this character. He reminded me of the kids who tried so hard for attention that they were constantly wearing new personas. Hell, he even creeps his way into Violet's heart when she initially isn't attracted to him (this is SO the wrong message to send to teens/tweens, btw). He's a knight in shining fedora, you know: the "I'm a nice guy" kinda guy who is really pretty warped and "extreme" as Violet initially refers to him. Because he was always desperate for attention it stands to reason that his actual cries for help were ignored.This book glorifies suicide.It makes it seemhauntingly beautiful. I'm sure there are kids reading this and contemplating attempting it for the "They'll all finally care when I'm gone!" reasons that this story seems to show with the aftermath.But this is not okay.It's not okay to romanticize the notion that counselors and peer groups can't be a place of support and help when having these kind of thoughts. I know teens like a tortured love story, but I'm just really ready for this sick-lit trend to end.Here's the thing:Your life matters. It mattersnow. It's great to leave a legacy, but please be remembered for who you were and what you did beyond how you died.
