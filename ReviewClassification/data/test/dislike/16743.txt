Thistediously long362 page story set in a 1924 British ruled India begins when an "old"(twice married)Mrs. Moore brings a plain freckled-faced Adela Quested on a visit to meet her son Ronny Heaslop, the City Magistrate, with hopes of marriage. Mrs. Moore soon befriends a local Indian and Surgeon, Dr. Aziz(view spoiler)[ who is ultimately accused of attacking Adela while touring the Marabar Caves(hide spoiler)]causing a political uproar.At this point in the novel.....a little over 160 pages, I justcould nottake the re-reading due to boredom any longer.....began skimming pages.....and discovered.....(view spoiler)[ Adela withdrew her acceptance to marriage, then changed her mind again(after a hand-holding auto accident).....Mrs. Moore left before the trial against Dr. Aziz bc she was fond of him refusing testimony.....then became ill and died at sea.....next, while on the stand, Adela withdraws her accusation against Dr. A bc she was(delusional?)and just wasn't sure who came into the cave behind her.(not sure what this person actually did anyway?).....Dr. A decides to sue for damages, but ends up not doing so.....this time, Ronny calls off the marriage out of embarrassment to his official position......Adela really doesn't care(ditto Ronny)returning to her people in England.....and.....Dr. A moves his practice away from the scandalous rumors.(hide spoiler)]. If I missed anything important, please feel free to tell me, but I truly don't much care!Anyway......this classic and noted influential story is filled with racial tension between the Indians and British throughout the telling which I believe to be the whole point of the book, but OMYGOSH.....what a soporific read! Whew!
