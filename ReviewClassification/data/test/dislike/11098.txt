If you take the first book and add some slight differences, annoying slang, a more unlikeable Tally, a complete assassination of Shay's character, and a forced love triangle, you basically have this book.The plot ofPrettiesreally is very similar to the plot ofUglies. Tally starts out living in the city, not questioning anything about her life until a new friend shows her there is more to it. She ends up escaping the city and living in the wilderness for a while and then meets up with the rebellion.(view spoiler)[ And the endings are very similar too, it looks like she's dragged back to the cityagainto be operated onagain.(hide spoiler)]All the hope I had for a decent female friendship between Tally and Shay is crushed. The love triangle that develops in this book is also really irritating and further ruined the book for me.I have no interest in the third book, Tally only became more and more unlikable in this one and I have no hope for her, or the plot, to improve.
