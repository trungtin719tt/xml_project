Eh. This was not the book for me, which I was disappointed to discover after two book-friends and an admired blogger all raved about this one. If I had expected less, I probably would have enjoyed it more, but as it stands, it ticked a few boxes for my various readerly pet peeves:1) A first person narrator2) An unreliable narrator (This is not a spoiler. Read the title. And the narrator has amnesia.)3) The narrator has amnesia.4) In the last 30 pages or so, the narrator/author make a big reveal that negates several "facts" that the reader has necessarily taken at face value for the previous 180 pages.If those things don't bother you, or at least don't bother you as much as they bother me, then you'll probably enjoy this book. I would have liked it more if it weren't hyped the way it was. I've seen the same tropes done better, and from what I knew of this author, I frankly expected more.Beyond that, I thought that the sibling and cousin relationships were particularly ill-drawn and I had trouble suspending my disbelief that these kids spend every summer together on their own private island, year after year, and yet have weirdly stilted dialogue. The adult relationships and the parent-child relationships all rang true to me, though.The big reveal at the end is incredibly tragic but only somewhat of a stunner, but unlike the folks here who claimed to have cried buckets, I was dry-eyed. If you read enough fiction featuring amnesiac and/or mentally unbalanced main characters, the ending to this book won't come totally out of left field. The only thing that left me truly feeling WTF was the actual execution of the Liars's Big Plan That Backfired. It's almost like they don't know the basics of physics/chemistry/accelerants. I won't say more because beyond there, spoilers lie.
