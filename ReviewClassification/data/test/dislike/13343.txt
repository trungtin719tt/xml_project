This review has spoilers so heads up.The series was a fun read (until the end when you realize you've been had). Obviously it is non-stop action from start to finish and James Dashner does a great job of that. I also really liked that the author doesn't shy away from violence which can sometimes take away from a teen book.HOWEVER, all of the above is pointless if the author doesn't EXPLAIN ANYTHING! Did you hope to find out what Thomas' memories were? Too bad. Did you want to know why Thomas, Theresa, and Aris were the only ones with telephathy? Nope, not gonna happen in this book! Did you want to know anything else? Maybe what happens to certain characters? TOO BAD.The idea that this HUGE, elaborate, deadly maze where kids lived for years was required to find a cure for a virus is just too far-fetched. That the kids were sent out into a zombie ridden, desert wasteland where there were an infinite number of uncontrolled variables and they all could have died at any moment - unbelievable. That ALL of this was to create a 'blueprint' for making a cure for the virus? No no no. Sure each individual idea is fun and exciting and imaginative....but I think it was all a bit over the top...In the end it turns out that 200 people who weren't even part of the Trials just waltz through a magic screen to paradise. Nope, these weren't even the strongest individuals who had survived the Trials, they were people captured by the Right Hand, thrown into a room, then thrown into a maze, and then led by Thomas into a magical paradise where they can all reproduce...Trilogy fail.P.S. I loved Newt and his story. It's things like that which are redeeming. There are certainly great moments within each book, but taken as a whole it just didn't work. I devoured each book in a matter of hours so if you're just looking for a fun read then have at it. Just don't expect it to make sense.
