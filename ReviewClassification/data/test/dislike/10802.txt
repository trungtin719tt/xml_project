Stupid book stupid characters. Here's an example:"You have to boil the water first, then you put the pasta in" Quinn said"How do you know that" Sam was frowning turning a blue box of rotini pasta trying to find instructions."Because I've seen my mom do it, like, a million times. The water has to boil first"Sam and Quinn starred at the big pot of water on the stove."A watched pot never boils," Edilio saidSam and Quinn both looked away. Edilio laughed. "It's just a saying. It's not actually true.""I knew that" Sam said. Then he laughed. "I actually didn't know that"Ladies and gentlemen I present to you the saviors of our world! Let's give 'em a round of applause folks. Or not. Sam(short for Samuel I think) is an absolute moron (as seen above) and yet he manages to become the leader of the band ofstupid, numb skullsteenagers. Also he has this weird thing where he's turned on by Astrid's starched white shirt - you know like the kind catholic school girls wear. Just look at it isn't that justsooooosexy?14 year old boys are so strange . . .Overall thee plot and characters are utterly forgettable. The villains are just plain dumb and the "good guys" even more so. So for the love of God don't read this book!!!!Okay, I'm done now. Full review to come.
