This is an interesting book in that it exactly fails to answer the question that you wish it would answer: what is it like to be both blind and deaf?Of course her education was marvelous and it is amazing that a young woman with those disabilities was able to overcome them and become a productive member of society. However, I found that the book focused much more on "how I became normal" instead of on "how my life is different."I found the prose to be a bit flowery (perhaps a product of the era? Perhaps a product of an over-eager Anne Sullivan? Perhaps a product of an over-eager editor?) and, well, completely unfocused.I'm genuinely sorry that I did not like this book better; such an amazing accomplishment should be commended--writing your autobiography as a blind and deaf woman...
