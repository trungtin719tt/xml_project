I liked the 1st book Evermore...though it may seem like a knock-off of the Twilight sagas, still the author manage to introduce new ideas and concepts like, auras, "elixir of life (from theories of alchemy), sacras, etc. That's the reason why I decided to read the 2nd one Blue Moon.However, I was disappointed... the character of Ever was portrayed a little stupid. What happened?!? I guess I'm just not used for the female protagonist to be written this way, all wrong and bad things that had happened was due to her impatience, recklessness and not using her head.Writing-wise, literary use of words were just ok, not spectacular and impressive. Atleast, the 3rd book Shadowlands have redeemed it A LITTLE, but there's still a lot of improvement to be hoped upon.
