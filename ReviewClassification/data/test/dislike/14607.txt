This book was laughable. Francesca is a housewife living in Iowa where no one--not her children, her husband or her neighbors--see her for the beautiful, fascinating worldly woman she is. Until that fateful day when Robert Kinkaid, a handsome, fascinating worldly man shows up on her doorstep asking for directions. And talk about great timing! Her husband and teen-aged children just happen to be out of town for the next four days. How convenient.Francesca and Robert have four crazy, wonderful days together, falling madly, deeply, irrevocably in love. (for some reason I feel compelled to use lots and lots of superfluous adverbs when describing this book) He asks her to run away with him. Though it breaks her heart and his, Francesca declines. And everyone cries.Obviously, Waller is pandering to the dowdy housewives among us who yearn to have a handsome, worldly man who sees us for the fascinating women we believe ourselves to be. It's a fantasy. Waller ignores the fact that every man (even the jerkiest of jerks) can be wonderful for the first four days.From beginning to end, this book set my teeth on edge.
