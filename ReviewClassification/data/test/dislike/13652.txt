edited 10/4Looking back at my notes without the haze of rage, I see that my hatred for Travis blinded me to this book's number 1 issue.7. Copy - Paste - PublishJamie McGuire plagiarised substantial chunks of Beautiful Disaster and marketed this as a new book. It's not just the dialogue but there are things on every single page that is almost a word for word copy of BD. I know this is the same story from a different point of view, so some repetition should be expected, but this is beyond ridiculous. The proof? Take a look at this little gem:Beautiful Disaster (Abby's POV):Shepley put his hand on Travis' shoulder. "We've all had a lot to drink. ..."Walking Disaster (Douchebag's POV):Shepley put his hand on Travis's shoulder. "We've all had a lot to drink. ..."For reals? Are you friggin kidding me? I mean come on. Not only are Abby and Travis' thoughtsexactlythe same,Travis fucking refers to himself as Travis.It doesn't get anymore obvious than that. Either he became an even bigger asshole and started referring to himself in third person (not entirely unbelievable come to think of it) or Jamie McGuire didn't even bother to edit her blatant copy and pastes. I guess this just shows you how much effort she put into 'writing' this book. Honestly I'm baffled. Capitalism at it's finest.original review 3/4DISASTROUSBD was a page-turner. Despite the obviously dysfunctional, abusive relationship and annoying characters, there was a very readable, unputdownable quality about it. As I was reading WD, I was hoping to get to know Travis, understand him and maybe like him. I thought McGuire would soften out his flaws and explain the reasons behind his actions... Nope. All his unlikeable qualities? She added a thousand and then threw gasoline on the fire.Walking Disasterwhy do I NOT love thee? Let me count the ways..1. The Insta-love.At least with BD, there was a build up. In this one it was love at first sight and we didn't even get to see the first meeting. WTF?2. The Writing Cliches.e.g. Comparing Abby to crack. I couldn't get enough...I'm addicted...I need more... Yadayada. Lame.3. Abby.At least I could understand some her actions through her thought process in BD. In Travis' POV, her indecisiveness was infuriating. She has no redeeming qualities besides being pretty. She was just there, being controlled by Travis. Not a good heroine at all.4. Travis' Arrogance.He acts like God's gift to women. Granted, McGuire wrote his VERY fictional world that way. There's really not one girl besides Abby that couldn't resist a tattooed, chain smoking, alcoholic, violent manslut? Really?5. "Bagged"I couldn't tell you how much I hate this word. I would rather him use fucked, screwed, laid, humped...anything. Why was sex referred to as bagged... Every. Single. Time? And it was A LOT of times considering he did more 'bagging' than a friggin' Costco employee. God I seriously wanted to throw my screen at times. What really drove my dislike home was:....in an attempt to break free of the flock of baggable females that usually crowded my deskA flock of baggable females?....What in the world? Who the hell speaks/thinks like this? I am Travis' age and nobody I know uses the terms flock, baggable and females in the same sentence. He honestly speaks like an immature virgin with no sexual experience whatsoever.Now the thing that made me want to punch Travis in the face...6. His MisogynyI'm a fan of Contemporary New Adult, therefore I've read the whole reformed player story a million times before. Usually the heros love sex and they love women. Just not sex with one woman. Travis is a whole different story. This guyHATESwomen. Actually not just hates women, he despises, loathes and abhors them. Yes despite having no standards and sleeping with everything that moves he is the most misogynist, sexist pig I've ever had the non-pleasure of reading about.If you've had sex with him... you're a skank.If you've had sex before the first month.... you're a slut.If you even showed interest in a guy you're not dating... you're a vultureUgh don't even get me started on the repeated vulture metaphor. It's repulsive. That and the way he treats women. His attitude towards them directly corresponded to their sexual behaviour. To say he was bitchy and judgemental is an understatement. I just didn't get it.So yes, as you can tell, I did not like this book. I will not be finishing this book. I will not be reading anything else by Jamie McGuire. The slut shaming in BD, I could deal with. The degradation of women in this book I could not.This read like a bad fan-fic. It felt lazy, designed to maximise profits for the author and her publishing company. It was not what should've been written by a NYT best-selling author.
