I can't wait to read this.I just read Bloodlines &amp; I'm already looking forward to The Golden Lily.My Assumptions:Sydney gets over her fear of vampires ( atleast the living ones, not the Strigoi ).Adrian moves on from Rose &amp; deepens his relationship with Sydney.Jill gets in a relationship with Mikah ( Mason #2 ) &amp; everyone flips out.Eddie dates Angeline to get over his love for Jill but fails miserable &amp; someone gets killed ( probably Mikah ).Dimitri is talking to Rose over the phone, Adrian over hears &amp; then proceeds to flip the fuck out thus messing things up with Sydney.Adrian &amp; Dimitri get in several heated arguements ( wishing )Sydney &amp; Adrian kiss.Jill realizes Eddie loves her f that she loves him too.Cliff hanger ending like in Bloodlines when Dimitri walked into Adrians house.LOL, this is going to be interesting.
