Now I guess I can to a certain extent appreciate the parodistic intent of Jon Scieszka'sThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales. However and that having all been said, Scieszka's retold narratives do not really work at all well for me as satires (as parodies), and primarily due to the fact there are simply far far too many tales presented. For honestly, as soon as the plot lines of the given stories ofThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Talesseem to become somewhat interesting and entertaining to and for me, there generally is an abrupt and rushed ending inserted by the author, and another, similarly choppy and equally annoyingly uneven tale commences (which sure does lead to potential distraction and for me, as well as massive tedium and frustration, and indeed so much so that I only very briefly and cursively skimmed the last three stories, and with scant regret).And while I am, in fact, still able to find a very select few of the ten or so adapted narratives ofThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Talespotentially funny and entertaining enough (as I will admit to chuckling a bit and with appreciation at the tale of the princess and the bowling ball and the story of the princess being tricked, being scammed by a non enchanted frog prince) even this truth, this factoid is simply NOT enough for me to rateThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Taleswith more than one star, well, actually with one and a half stars, if half stars were possible (as personally, the choppy and frustratingly uneven endings combined with the fact that I also rather majorly detest the accompanying illustrations, which while expressive and artistically competent, I just seem to find creepy and most aesthetically unpleasing, their Caldecott Honour designation for illustrator Lane Smith quite notwithstanding, all of this really does make me rather majorly dislikeThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Talesand indeed in every way).
