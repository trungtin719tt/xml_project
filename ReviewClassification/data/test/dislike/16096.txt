I wish that I could give this book 3 stars. I really wish that I could. I mean there are a lot of parts of the book that I really liked. But in general the story was a little familiar...I read a book earlier this year that was almost exactly the same plot line but of course was not as well put together as a Nicholas Sparks' book! And up until the last chapter and epilogue, I was going to give it 3 stars. But that last bit ruined it for me. Not to spoil anything for any readers, but seriously, the guardian is not at all what I, being a reader, wanted it to be. I mean, the book is based around a love story with a thrilling secondary plot, and the love story in the end has nothing to do with the ending. What the heck?!? It left me incredibly underwhelmed.
