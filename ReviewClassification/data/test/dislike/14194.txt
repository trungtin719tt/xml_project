These books are fine and all but has anyone else realized that there are going to be TWELVE of them in total?! After Burned you have Stolen, Burdened, Touched, Cloaked and Wanted. No wonder they are starting to tell the story from multiple perspectives. (Speculation is now at fifteen books).Loving the U.K. cover by the way, disappointed its not Stevie Rae like the U.S. but it will look good on my shelf anyway.Finally, time for me to actually review it. Okay, so this took me a while to read seeing as I have to study for the state exams the Irish government insist I take.Well, I enjoyed this far more than I thought I would, I really did. I still hate Zoey, and speaking of hate, I despise Damien, Jack, and the Twins too.But now for things I like, Stark for one, and pretty much anything to do with Stevie Rae and Rephaim, I hope that ends well.This book still has the shameless pop culture references and I hate the really over the top "And I suddenly realised what I must say..." moments but all in all, its a good book.Lets just hope Rephaim, Stevie Rae and Stark get their happy endings now.Oh, I must also compliment the authors for the research they did, although I obviously don't speak Scottish Gaelic, I definitely recognised the words that are identical to Irish.
