I really likedThe Clan of the Cave Bear. Jean Auel's research brings the stone age to life, wrapping around the story like a perfect mammoth skin blanket. The plot was good. The details and activities of the characters' life were gripping. We felt Ayla's struggle, her plight and so forth. For a big book, it rocked along.This second outing to the distant B.C. grinds along like Ayla is dragging a big stone block behind her. Sure there's plenty of interest in survival stories, but for the length of the book, it feels pretty padded. Then, quite out of the blue, it turns into a caveman blue movie. Did the critics ofThe Clan of the Cave Bearsay something like, "Great book, but there weren't any explicit sex scenes. Please try harder next time, Ms Auel. Perhaps also throw one in that involves horses."She did.Where it really loses its way is when it stops being Ayla-centric. As soon as Jondalar takes the prehistoric stage, the book becomes a soap opera. He's just a bit too amazing for words. He's all man. In fact, he's such a man, he's more man than Ayla can take.And of course, now we get inside Jondalar's head... Dear Lord, help me finish this review... we discover Ayla is also perfectly proportioned... and he develops groin pains. It ain't kidney stones and the cure is for him to go at it hammer and tongs with the newly discovered catwalk model Ayla.I suppose you could argue that Jondalar has to be amazing because he got all the good family genes. His brother Thonolan is monumentally dumb. Chasing a cave lion that stole your meat is worthy of a Darwin Award. The early death this book delivers to the series probably does too.
