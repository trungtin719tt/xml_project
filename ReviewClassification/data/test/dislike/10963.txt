The romantic in me was dying at the end of this. Arya! Still it was a very satisfying conclusion to the series and I feel so awed by what Chris Paolini has been able to accomplish. The language alone for all the different cultures included in the book must have taken an incredible amount of work. My favorite parts of this book were the dragon eggs, the green dragon, the giant snail creatures, and Murtagh. I have a soft spot for him and hope he finds happiness.
