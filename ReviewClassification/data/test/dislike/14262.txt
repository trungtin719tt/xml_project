I knew it would only be a matter of time before Sookie began to annoy me a little, and this book marked the beginning of it. To be fair, though, I'm not sure it if was her so much as her interaction with Quinn that didn't sit that well with me. After the previous book, it was kind of a no-brainer that Quinn would become the next addition to Sookie's growing parade of suitors. I didn't really care for him or his relationship with Sookie. The whole "I shall compliment you at any given moment, and you'll glow with happiness" routine is good and fine, but it's just not interesting to me. So, I'm not particularly looking forward to seeing more of him in the next couple of books.(At this point, I've also developed a definite preference for what man I want Sookie to end up with, and I'm leaning towards Sam or Eric. Naturally, I realize this may have biased me against Quinn, but oh well, so things go.)On the plus side, I like how things came together at the end of the novel, but I spent so many pages keeping up with meandering storylines that it was kind of a killjoy. Well into the 100s, we were still getting briefed by Sookie on her past with such and such character. It's probably a result of the series growing in scope and characters still sticking around, but it was a tad tiresome and resulted in the book not holding my attention as well as the previous ones did.Bill's revelation was raw and painful, and I think Harris did a good job with Sookie's reaction. There was a good balance of agony and humor to make the revelation work well in the context of the story.Anyways, this was a decent book, but a far cry from the best.
