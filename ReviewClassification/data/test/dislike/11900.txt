Unlike most religious texts that are approached metaphorically, the Book of Mormon claims to be an historical history of the Americas, which is a verifiable claim.The linguistic, anachronistic, biological, sociological, and archaeological evidence against this being a legitimate history of the Americas is monumentally staggering. Pick a random field of study, and that field has numerous evidences illustrating the impossibility of this being historically accurate. Even BYU's own archaeology department shut down their research into its historical accuracy in the seventies, because they didn't find anything after decades of field research.Setting all of that aside, the text is derivative to the point of containing translation/text errors and phrases unique to the contemporary books it borrowed chunks from (mainly: 1.View of the Hebrews 1825: Or the Tribes of Israel in America2.The Late War Between the United States and Great Britainand 3.The First Book of Napoleon, and of course the KJV version of the Old Testament/New Testament).I'd give it a C for effort by the standards of the 1800s, but if you're going to claim a found text as history, and you want it to last, you simply have to try harder than this. It just doesn't hold up to modern standards for determining authenticity.
