I think this may end up being aDNFfor me; consider this a prelimary reaction as I put it on hold. I've only read a few chapters so far, but I'mstruggling with the quirky/cute stylemarried with a subject as serious as suicide. I mean, are we going to see self-mutilation or child abuse or domestic violence or homophobia painted with cotton candy colors next? This is one of those set-ups (girl meets boy as they're both standing on a ledge contemplating suicide, rat-a-tat precocious-funny dialogue ensues) thatprobably works better as an indie darling romantic comedyfilm than it does in book form, as there are no soundtracks or Instagram-type filters or dizzying camera tricks to distract from the main point of the story.It's not that I don't think heavy topics can't be handled with a light hand (see the excellent--and hilarious--Suicide Notes, and I believe pretty much every John Green novel I haven't read), but thus far I'mnot charmed enough by the relationships or humor or writing here to forget that suicide is used as a cute plot device. If the bookalsodealt well with the serious, no-shit implications and consequences of the acts these kids are contemplating, I might be more inclined to continue, but after chatting with my fabulous co-blogger Layla, it doesn't sound like that really ever happens--and in fact, the severe depression and(view spoiler)[and mental illness and manic pixie dream boy trope(hide spoiler)]don't sound like they're handled with satisfactory weight. She wrote a real review for the book here:http://www.themidnightgarden.net/2015...discussing specifics if you're curious.I'm wondering too--do reactions to this book vary depending on how much personal experience you've had with suicide or depression?Suicide has touched my life in ways that have forever changed me, and while I don't consider myself overly sensitive or prone to reacting to triggering material, other readers might find it easier to accept this facile treatment--or even harder, depending on your history.Most readers I know seem to be absolutely loving this book, though, so take our reactions with that in mind. As I have a mental block with it at this point, I'm setting it aside for now, though I'm guessing I might come back to it out of curiosity, or if the year-end awards cycle sweeps this one up in its wake. It certainly seems like just the type of book that would be prone to do that.An advance copy was provided by the publisher for this review.
