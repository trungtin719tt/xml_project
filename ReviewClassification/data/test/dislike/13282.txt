Had I been reading this on paper instead of my computer, it probably would have gone into the fireplace here: "She was incredibly hot--in that popular-girl-with-bleached-teeth-and-anorexia kind of way, which was Colin's least favorite way of being hot." And if somehow it had survived that initial immolation, I definitely would have shredded it for birdcage fodder (and I don't even own a bird!) here: "She looked prettier than she ever had before--Colin always preferred girls without makeup."This book was everything I don't like about John Green. And I've already spent enough of my one precious life complaining about how his books are the literary embodiment of high school boys being unsuccessful in love and the general social hierarchy and then constructing an impossibly unpleasant wall of moral superiority as some sort of retroactive explanation for why no one likes them (they're all stupid and superficial anyway and I'm ABOVE all of that) when really maybe they're just obnoxious or plain unlucky and they can't seem to realize that - etc etc to want to spend much more time on it. Basically this is the platonic ideal of John Green books. His books teach bad lessons to fragile kids and turn them into insufferable judgmental douchebags.So Colin, maybe all those Katherines dumped you because you're kind of an asshole. Where's the variable for that?
