This book was an unsatisfying read. I found the story, particularly the main story of an old man and a middle-aged woman falling in love compelling and believable. However, the book had some major flaws, in my opinion.1. The dialect is painful. "Cause if'n you do, or if'n you have a mind to after you git over bein' so mad at him, why, we could git this'n annulled. Folks in Cold Sassy will have a good time talkin', but if you go on off to Texas, why, you won't have to put up with nothin' on account of it. So you want to marry him or don't you? (177)"2. The suicide scene is shocking, with no foreshadowing, and is completely without purpose. No one is changed by Uncle Camp's death. No one's character is further developed through it.3. The book relied too heavily on the "overheard conversation" technique. Really, really beyond belief. Will overhears: declarations of love, revelations of rape and incest, discussions of theology, heavy petting, repentence for infedelity, reunions of lovers, confessions of past sins, among other things.4. The message that organized religion was always wrong, and that any rebellion against it was to be considered correct and common sense wearied me after a while.The back of the book said, "Not since To Kill a Mockingbird has a novel so deftly capture the subtle crossscurrents of small-town southern life." Hmmm. . . I think this book is miles, miles away from To Kill a Mockingbird in just about every category.
