I cried, a bit, at this book's end. I felt I had truly seen the mountain sleeping, just there, curled on its side, and felt the low, cold wind whistle past. My mind fell easily into the cadence of the dialect, and sung to itself with each welsh name. I felt the valley with his words.For me, this book's beauty read sharply, showing strength in simple naturalistic description and dialogue. Its characters, who I found deeply relatable, are rare enough, in literature and in life. I already miss the hearth with its ever-present tea, and cry again for the valley.Some reviewers have addressed the author's fraud, but I did not consider it while reading. Let the work stand for itself. Authors have always been a flawed crowd, along with the rest of us. Certainly don't expect to know the whole of Welsh culture from one novel, though. But anyway, just go ahead and see the mountain for yourself.
