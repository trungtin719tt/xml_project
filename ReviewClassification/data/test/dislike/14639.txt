On a rare ocassion, I tend to read a Sparks book that hasn't been made into a movie, so that the story still sounds fresh and new to me. Unfortunately, this one disappointed me. This was a rather stagnating story; meaning that nothing much happened besides the musings of fifty-something man, Wilson, who's married to Jane, the daugther of the eldery Noah Calhoun (and Allie) who were the main characters of the Notebook.After a thirty years of marriage, Wilson has finally realized that maybe his wife has fallen out of love with him. His arguments for coming to that conclusion are very well rationalized. He's been an absent father, more focused on providing for his family than being part of that family. He's been working non-stop and has established an excellent reputation as an estate lawyer. They are not super rich, but they are upper middle-class people. It's always been his wife, Jane, that was close to the children, and close to what's at the emotional heart of their little unit.What we witness in this book is the progression, the best-case-scenario of a man trying to win back the emotional connection to his wife. It's not that it wasn't very valid, but it wasn't very thrilling either. It was sweet. No more, no less.
