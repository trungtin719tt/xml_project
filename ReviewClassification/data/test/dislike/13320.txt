I know many liked this book. Though I did finish it, it just wasn't for me. First of all, there was too much southern dialect in the writing. I'd willingly accept all dialogue to be in dialect, but much - though not all - of the first person narrative was also written in dialect. Near the beginning of the book, and several times throughout, were references to "damnyankees". As an Alaskan, I understand I don't qualify as a "yankee", but my great grandfather proudly served in the Union Army and I was deeply offended. Finally, there was just too much religious philosophy. If I want to read a book on religious philosophy, please let it be my choice, not a novel. This book barely rises above 1 star.
