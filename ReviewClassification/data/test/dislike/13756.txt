Let me start off that I LOVE THIS MOVIE! I can quote mostly the whole movie. My father and I always exchange quotes randomly. I can watch this movie all the time. With that said, I was soo disappointed with the book. I am pretty sure the writer or director of the movie read the book and said I could make a better movie. Curiosity persuaded me to read it, but again sadly disappointed.
