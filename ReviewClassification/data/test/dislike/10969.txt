I already knew that a person doesn't read these books for the writing, but the recap of the books, while helpful, is an example of pathetic writing. What really is the role of an editor? To make sure you don't use the same trite phrase too many times on a single page? "For the reader of this book was mightily annoyed."I'm noticing a trend that I'm frustrated with the length of most of the books I'm reading. Maybe it's just me, or maybe authors are going completely nuts, editors aren't doing their jobs, and people are willing to pay more for a long book? I know it's harder to write a "tight" story, without extraneous scenes. That's why we call published authors "professionals" and pay them, right?How weird that after 4 books, they finally beat the bad guy, and there is still 200 pages of "stuff" to say.In summary, cool fantasy elements and gripping battle scenes, punctuated by numbingly long stretches of "flying around on dragons" and general angst. I think I'm burned out on fantasy novels and anything written recently that's over 300 pages.
