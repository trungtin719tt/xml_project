Sometimes I wonder if I have been too judgemental with a book, I returned and reread a good chunk of this and feel if anything I was too generous. The problem I feel is that Bryson's humour is all about people. The odd people he meets and the funny things they say. On a footpath, in a forest, there are not many people and the interactions between Bryson and his sidekick Katz don't carry the weight of my expectations. The other ingredient in Bryson's style is a general attitude that the world is going to hell in a hand cart, and that cart has a wobbly wheel, which squeaks. This mindset qualified him to become the head person at the Campaign for the Preservation for Rural England, in this book it is evident in his belief that everybody has done everything wrong. So if it is not bad enough that logging is allowed in US national parks, to add insult to injury that logging is inefficient and loss making. If the Parks service leave an area to allow nature to do what it wills, that is wrong too. I had the feeling that for him Nature was perfect in, perhaps 1937(view spoiler)[ or some other year(hide spoiler)]and the efforts of all right thinking public organisations should be directed to keeping things exactly as they were in 1937.At this time in his life Bryson was irregularly uprooting himself and family from England to the USA and then from the USA to England, England at times was plainly too English for him while the USA seemingly has a majority population of overweight car obsessed people who can barely stagger a half mile on foot, many of whom are also irredeemably stupid and inbred. Having said that whenever he stumbles across a hostelry he gorges himself on grease burgers and makes off with multi litre bottles of fizzy pop. He admits while walking to generally zoning out and not being aware of the landscape which apparently is largely all the same for him(view spoiler)[ some might regard that as a slight disadvantage for someone writing a book about a long distance walking trail(hide spoiler)]. I feel that Bryson's vision of his fellow Americans is largely a mirror image of himself(view spoiler)[ and viewed too close he finds the reflection horrible, back on the other side of the Atlantic it is, to mangle popular sayings, enticingly greener(hide spoiler)], an intellectual butterfly that prefers to flitter than to seriously engage with anything and so with regard to the management of the National Parks I note that ecology is hard, mismanagement from one perspective or another near inevitable.Overwhelmingly I felt he would have preferred to have been walking in England - start the day in a pub, finish in a pub, unless unlucky lunch in a pub too, a rich collection of charming eccentrics on the footpaths admiring a landscape which by US standards would be dreary with nothing wilder than some sheep in sight.This a deeply, thoroughly and utterly ok kind of book, completely middle of the road. It's readable, moderately humorous and slightly informative and if you never read it your life will be no poorer.Bryson, writing this book doesn't know the Appalachian trail as somebody who has walked it a few times, or short stretches regularly might, or even somebody who has lived alongside it might. Nor from his text did I believe he had much knowledge of long distance walking. So I'm not sure that I can take his praise or criticisms of the route, its management or those who use it seriously. More to the point having read it, I don't feel an urge to explore it myself which is about the worst thing I can say about a book of this nature.
