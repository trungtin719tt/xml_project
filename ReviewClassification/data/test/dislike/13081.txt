Oh, god.Okay, so, Hush Hush is kind of quiet.Crescendo is really loud.Silence is....silent.SO WHAT CAN YOU POSSIBLY CALL THIS? Semi-Sorta-Loud-Stormy-Angsty-Silence?And by the way...OH, SO NOW IT'S A SAGA? It started with the Twilight saga. And now the Fallen saga. Then the Beautiful Creatures saga. And now...I can just picture B-Fitz's conversation with her publisher.Fitzpatrick: Look, looky here! I've finished Silence! I can finally stop writing and sit on my piles of dough in peace!Publisher: Now, now, dear. Remember, the money you make is the money I make too. OH, I KNOW! We can make it a saga! Everyone else is doing it, anyway.Fitzpatrick: Ah, well. I don't have anything else to do since Law and Order: CI got cancelled and that thrift store down the street closed. Hey, what the heck, saga it is!@Whoever made the comment about humping a dead horse wildly: Exactly.Edit: Well, well. It's called Finale. Well, um...it sure is straightforward. And when the sequel to Finale comes out, I'll be here, laughing my ass off.EDIT AGAIN: He doesn't own a shiiiiiiiirt!
