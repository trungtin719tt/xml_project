October Buddy Read with the Pantsless OnesWhen an occult scholar recruits people to help him research the paranormal events at Hill House, will the house let any of them leave unscathed?I've heard this touted as a classic haunted house story for decades and finally decided to take the plunge when the Pantless Ones picked it for an October read. I was not overly impressed.I don't know if this was the case of wrong book/wrong time but I was not engaged by this book. All of the characters seemed like caricatures to me rather than real people.There were some creepy parts, like Eleanor holding a hand in the dark that turned out not to be whose she thought, and Eleanor's descent into madness, but I was pretty bored most of the time. The status bar on my Kindle couldn't creep to the right fast enough.I'm giving it two stars now but I may re-read it in the future when I'm in the mood for such a story.
