Begone, ye overblown romance: to the M's with ye, and there ye shall stay.No more will I be forced to read about the "ample breasts" of mysterious, mute women; never again will I be witness to "sexual encounters" that are just a "concept," not the actual bumping of uglies that occurs when a man puts his penis inside of a woman's vagina.Banished will be the sporty assassinatrix who winds down by having one-night stands with bald-headed men; the stocky writer who oscillates between mathematics and prose and the occasional dalliance with a married girlfriend; and the misshapen cranium of an ugly man who skitters from one plot-point to the next with grim purpose, unsuspecting of the authorial foot that hovers, god-like, above the story's flimsy re-bar.Along with these mundane presences, so too will be exiled the various supporting paper cut-outs, wearing the clothes and skins of nurses and bodyguards and editors, muttering incomprehensible directions that pose as mysterious truths in a world with two moons.Get out, all of you: 925 pages was more than your fair share, and more than its fair share was squandered on wordy mediocrity.
