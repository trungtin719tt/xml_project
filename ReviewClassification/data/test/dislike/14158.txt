If I wanted to read about sexual slavery, rape, gang rape, and gang rape with an audience, I'd just read the news everyday. Actually, I do read the news every day. This kind of stuff is rampant. It always blows my mind that SF-F authors - who can write about ANYTHING, no limits - often choose to return to stuff like sexual slavery.This is not entertainment for me. It is real life, it is every day, and it is NOT what I seek out in my fiction.Russell is a great writer - this one-star is not a reflection of her writing. Her character development is also excellent, which makes it that much worse when a character we love, a wonderful man, gets brutally raped over and over and over and over ad nauseam.They also slaughter and eat infants and children.No matter how good the writing is I cannot get on board with this. Call it a personal hang-up. If I knew sexual slavery and gang rape were the punchline to this novel, I'd never have read it.
