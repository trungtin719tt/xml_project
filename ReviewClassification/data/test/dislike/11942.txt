I really hate slamming books, really I do. This book is the typical chick-lit that I've grown to love, and to be fair, it's a quick read.But, my praise stops there.The main character of this book, Rebecca Bloomwood, is the most annoying, daft, and ridiculous character I have ever had the misfortune to read about. I understand that she's a "shopaholic", but I've had quite a few friends who fell into that catagory that were never in danger of being as simple-minded and arrogant as Rebecca.Every time I put this book down, I find myself angry. My forehead is wrinkled, and I'm snapping at my innocent boyfriend.Why?I'll give you a hint: It isn't because I'm upset at having to put the book down!All I can tell you is that unless you, yourself, are ignorant, incredibly stupid, deceitful, materialistic, dishonest, and rude...you will find nothing to associate with in Becky Bloomwood.
