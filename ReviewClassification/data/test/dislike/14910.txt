Buzzword-A-Thon: WhereUnexpected Read-A-Thon: Read something that's been on your TBR since 2018 or earlierI'm in the minority on this one, because this book has great reviews and people seem to love it. I think I read a different book then everyone else, because this book was not good.Where The Heart Is by Billie Letts is about 17 year old Novalee Nation who's seven months pregnant and has just been abandoned at a Wal-Mart by her baby daddy.The best way to describe Where The Heart Is, is its a Tyler Perry play for white people. Its overly dramatic with dark subject matter like child abuse, poverty and grief being handled in the most child like and ham handed way possible. Everything is tied up in a nice little bow at the end. Novalee was such a simpleton and idiot that I kept rooting for her to get hit by a bus. I get it Forrest Gump made everyone want to write a book about a loveable idiot but Novalee is no Forrest Gump. Forrest Gump is THE BEST and I will fight anyone who disagrees.I had planned to watch the movie to this book which stars one of my favorite actresses Natalie Portman but I don't think I'll be able to do it. Where The Heart Is was a super fast read so that's why I gave it 2 Stars instead of 1 but I didn't enjoy this book any way. Maybe I waited too long to read it or maybe I was never gonna like it.I don't recommend Where The Heart Is
