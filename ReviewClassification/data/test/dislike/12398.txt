i wasn't a big fan of shiver and linger did not make me a convert. parts of the story bored me to tears. it felt like the main characters - sam &amp; grace were just going through the motions and their story dragged on with absolutely NOTHING interesting happening. i can't speak for everyone but when i read shiver's ending, i knew sam and grace's situations were going to be reversed and i thought linger would deal with the aftermath. turns out, this entire book would be about getting to that "reversal" point without explaining anything at all. i mean, in linger, it says that the change in grace was brought about by the toxin that had been lying dormant in her until it sort of needed to get out right? but didn't grace get bitten by shelby in the first book? shouldn't that have affected whatever insane reaction this wolf toxin's supposed to have on her body? maybe the author has an explanation for that in the third book but for me, it just doesn't jell. also, sam and grace's voices don't sound like teenagers at all! really, which 17, 18 year olds talk/think like that? even 100+ year old vampires sound more like a teenager than those two.one thing i liked about this book was the addition of cole and isabel's POV. their story wasn't all that great but at least they weren't as lifeless as sam and grace. and when isabel was pounding on sam about taking care of the wolves and finding out what was wrong with grace, i was thinking along with her: damn right! get some balls, you spineless wuss. seriously, i wanted to slap some sense into sam's insipid character. if not for cole and isabel, i don't think i care enough to know what happens next.
