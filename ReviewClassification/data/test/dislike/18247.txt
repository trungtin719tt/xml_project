In the Mysterious Benedict Society, four children with four different problem solving skill sets come together to solve a mystery. Those four children consist of the reader, who has the amazing ability to memorize things; the engineer, who has the amazing ability to create anything to solve the task at hand from materials she carries with her; the baby, whose chief attribute is to be unpredictable and not listen to the rules much less follow them; and the professional puzzle solver, who looks at everything as a riddle needing a solution. The dangerous mystery they must solve can only be done by children because adults are far too complicit in the evil.Take away the fourth child character, and you're pretty much left with an ungothic Lemony Snicket. There are no great tragedies, the children learn that some adults can very much be trusted (in fact, are necessary to their health and safety), and of course, there is a happy ending. The world has no difficult choices or impossible complexity, and along with that, there is no subtle humor. The book also doesn't have any of the textual play that made Lemony Snicket like a modern day Tristram Shandy. In short, it stripped the Lemony Snicket books of everything I read them for. That's why I couldn't completely finish this book.On the other hand, I still think younger children (6th grade and under) would find this book charming. They don't read Lemony Snicket for the gothic bits, they read them for the puzzle bits, and in this respect alone, the Mysterious Benedict Society is superior. Not only does it give the reader several fun puzzles, it shows how each child solves that puzzle. As one reviewer pointed out, this can get tiring for the adult readers, but I still think children would find it all good fun.
