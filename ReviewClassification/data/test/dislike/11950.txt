This book was a waste of my time. And I spent far too much time on this book that I really didn't like.The first 200 pages or so are spent with the main character, Rebecca, avoiding all her collection calls and all the letters in the mail from her creditors. She stuffs things into trucks, she keeps the letters in a drawer she never opens, anything to avoid the fact that she's got bills to pay. And then she has an embarrassing run-in with a sales clerk who tells her all her cards are declined. She doesn't even try to face her debts then. Oh no. She runs away to her parents' home, and goes into hiding, telling her parents that she's being stalked by the banker that's been calling her.It's only then, in the last 50 pages, she gets a handle on herself, and then everything basically falls into her lap. I'm sorry, I just can't believe all that. It doesn't help that the woman is surrounded by people who think the least of her. But suddenly, she writes something wonderful, gets to go on TV, and hooks up with a guy, and all is well. No. I don't think so. And she doesn't even truly change at the end. She spends 140 pounds on three pairs of designer sunglasses she doesn't need. GREAT way to get yourself out of debt. GREAT way.Don't bother with this book. It's not as fun as it seemed like it would be. It's depressing and annoying. Just don't bother.
