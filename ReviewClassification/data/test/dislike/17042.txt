Author dug around in WWI histories and could find next to nothing on Gavrilo Princip the man who assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand which started WWI, so he decided to find out what he could about him by tracking GPs movements in Bosnia before the act. This is part history part travelogue. Butcher hikes cross country, crosses Tent Mountain and bumps into a host of colourful folk. He also spends some time detailing Tito and the partisans as well as the miseries suffered by Bosnian Moslems in the 1990s war (Butcher covered this conflict as a reporter for a British newspaper). But the Princip investigation is the best part. What Butcher discovers is that Princip did his dastardly deed on behalf of southern Slav freedom from Austro-Hungarian domination. It was the Austro-Hungarians who twisted it into a Serbian plot for their own purposes and in the process starting the domino effect that created WWI. Well done.
