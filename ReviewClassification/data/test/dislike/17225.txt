To be fair, I think if you are a fan ofStephenie Meyerand all her books (includingThe HostandBreaking Dawn), you will enjoy this novella too. Alas, I am not. Gone are the days when I used to be entranced by the Twilight Saga. I have to give credit to SM for introducing me to the genre of paranormal fiction, but as I read more and more of it, it is getting more obvious how subpar her writing is.I didn't finish this novella. I abandoned it because it was boring, one-note, lacked excitement, and very wordy without substance. Plus I couldn't stop myself from nitpicking (and it is always a bad sign):1) Does any vampire actually ever go through a violent and horrific newborn phase Eddie used to warn Bella about on numerous occasions? Because nobody seems to have suffered through it in Victoria's gang, everyone appears to be very aware and at the same time with no sign of remorse or guilt (including Bree and Diego).2) So, how exactly can you cover up disappearances of hundreds of vamp victims, even if they all are prostitutes and drug addicts?3) Vampire kissy noises - stone on stone? Eww, and why, Bella, was it really like snogging a statue? And arebadvampires not allowed to go beyond 1st base? Because I don't think Victoria and Riley do, they prefer making vamp "kissy noises." The only reason I am asking this question is because of the portrayal of Cullens as sex-crazed-furniture-breaking nymphomaniacs inBreaking Dawn. Why should newborn teenage vampires be any different?4) Seeing sparkles evidently causes instant "to-die-for" love?5) To make vamps want to puke is another special vamp power, right?6) A couple of 15- and 18-year old newborn vamps, when alone, talk about special BFF clubs, secret handshakes and being ninjas.Well, I guess I have at least somewhat satisfied my curiosity - I wanted to know if my interest forTwilightcould ever be revived. The answer is: No, it can't.
