Wow. This review.......... . . . . .. . .Let's just say, I might have been very, very tired when I wrote it, and write another review. Perhaps a more cohesive, comprehensive one. Onward!This book was split into two because the author found he was writing too much to compress into one book. Dude, that's because there were too many battles and unnecessary bullshit going on here. They could have easily been one novel. I'm going to summarize Inheritance with one word: bloated. There is a whole chapter about a dwarf rolling a ball of dirt together. I shit you not.Another thing that was pretty crappy: there arefartoo many chapters about Roran. Roran this, Roran that. Roran fighting battles and being badass, Roran smashing people to pieces with his hammer, Roran adding absolutely nothing to the plot and taking up probably around 700 valuable pages of plot and character development. Nope. No thanks.To elaborate on how much the ending sucked ass.... Well, it did. Paolini basically wrote himself into a corner with an invincible villain and had to undo it by having Galbatorix defeated by...being shown hisfeelings??Okay.Some more things that bothered me (I'll keep adding onto the review as I think of them): Firnen. The badass green dragon, the one who you see on the cover of this novel, so he MUST be important, right?? The badass green dragon who shows up for thelast 50 pagesof the novel and does absolutely NOTHING except make sweet, sweet love to Saphira while Eragon and Arya watch uncomfortably, presumably experiencing every sweet second of it through their psychic epic mind connections. So, it's kind of as if Eragon and Aryadidget together, right? Once I explain the technicalities to any fangirls who haven't already figured it out, I can picture a victory celebration held by victorious shippers. On second thought, I better not explain anything. Right.The series was no masterpiece but it was entertaining enough. This book wasn't terrible, so far as the series' standards go. By normal standards it was pretty shitty, but one thing I can comment positively on was the character development. We can see very clearly that Eragon has turned from a 15-year-old creepy hormonal small-town farmer (and also a total loser) into a regal dragon rider with far more control over every aspect of himself. That's a good thing, right? So I've fulfilled my obligations? I can go now?Okay, review over. Bye!
