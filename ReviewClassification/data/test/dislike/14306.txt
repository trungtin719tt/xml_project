All three books (Kindle edition) in the trilogy (The Passage #1, The Twelve # 2 and City of Mirrors #3) are currently on offer: 0.99p in the UK and $0.99 (I think) in the US. No idea how long for. I bought the first two novels, awhile back, when they were on offer; and now, I've finally got the third book, uber cheap. Hope they're good. I might get around to reading them, someday. I hope.
