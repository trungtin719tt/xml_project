Thank goodness I'm finally done. I've read some bad "classics," but this one takes the cake.Bigger, a young black man in the Chicago of what I believe is the 1940s, is trouble. His mother knows it, his sister knows it, and his friends know it. Even in the beginning of the book, before the major events start happening, Bigger plans an armed robbery (which he later didn't commit), terrorizes movie-goers, and beats up a friend, all in a single day.Then he gets a job, a good job as a chauffeur for a wealthy but friendly white family, which gives him a second chance. Hours later, he accidentally kills the daughter of the household. I actually felt kind of sorry for him at that point--the murder was truly an accident but, as a black man, he knew nobody would ever believe it. But what comes later...in the interest of not regurgitating the entire plot, let's just say that Bigger doesn't exactly mend his ways.I couldn't figure out what the author was trying to say with this book. I get that Richard Wright was an angry black activist--that makes sense. But instead of making his main character into a sympathetic figure, he made it clear many times over that Bigger was a complete sociopath who never felt remorse for any of his actions. There's a large section where Bigger is trying to escape a full-fledged manhunt in South Chicago, and I kept thinking, "Am I actually supposed to be rooting for him? I want them to find the guy NOW, lock him up, and throw away the key."And why is Bigger a sociopath? Because white people made him that way, of course. Or so Bigger tells himself in his long internal monologues which happened on every other page. Again, I couldn't figure out what the author was getting at. Was the plight of black men in 1940s Chicago dire? Absolutely. (But even Bigger's own friends were finding decent jobs and carving out lives for themselves. Why did he make Bigger the protagonist?) Was it horrible that Bigger's family had to live in a rat-infested one-room apartment? Sure. Did these situations make it okay that Bigger went out and randomly killed people? Um, no.If this book had been written by a white person, I think it would have been denounced as a book that condoned racism. Bigger certainly seemed sub-human. As a book about social injustice--I just didn't get it.
