I once had high hope for this book. Look at the beautiful cover! It was written by a German novelist and it actually got translated into many other languages! It should be a worthy read, right?However, when I turned the last page, all I could think of isTHANKS THE MOTHER FREAKING HEAVEN! I CAN FINALLY GET RID OF THIS BORING BOOK NOW!I don't mean to say this book is 100% awful, still the mind-breaking boredom makes me feel like I had been thoroughlytorturedwhen I finished this book.That's how I feel:GIFSoup(Link:https://giphy.com/gifs/animated-cult-...)If you wanted to feel some real pain, watch this awesome music video by Nega: muddy cult(Warning: 18+ for violence, gross and nudity)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cmp5q...All my high expectation were built up for nothing, I struggled between giving it 1 star or 2 stars, but in the end I guessa disappointed 1.5 starsshould be enough.Here is the few problems I've with this book:(1) Worst. YA. Parent. EverI'm talking about the MC's mother, she wants to keep her teenage daughter safe by NOT TELLING HER ANYTHING OF IMPORTANCE FOR 16 WHOLE YEARS.(2) The MC sounds like a 12 years old kid instead of a 16 years oldThe MC (what's her name? don't remember) has a voice which can be humorous and light hearted at times, but reading a 300+ book filled with the thoughts of an immature child can be a pure torture.(3) Insta-loveThe male lead, this what-is-his-name handsome fellow with longish hair and green eyes, is rather rough to the what-is-her-name MC and he is always insulting toward her, but at the very end these two are kissing, out of the blue?(4) The slow pacing......or should I say....nothing happens in this bookThe MC suddenly finds she can travel through time and her family is part of a secret society of time-travelers! But within this book, people just go from one place to another, sitting in one historical place or two to have one discussion then the next. One single action scene is offered, then the book ends with an entirely anticlimactic finale. Not to mention, hardly anything has been explained or solved.Who would have guessed a book about time-traveling and secret societies can be so, so, soBORINGandIRRITATING?(5) The rules about time-traveling have been ignoredThe what-is-her-name MC just point-blank tells *people from the past* the events which are going to happen in the future!!!I'm going to return this book to the library tomorrow and I'm not going to read the sequels.Plus, it's a real shame that I am the one who suggested the library to buy this book at the first place.(Link:http://photobucket.com/images/nega%20...)
