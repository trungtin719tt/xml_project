IS THIS THE SAME GUY WHO WROTE THE DARK TOWER?!Horrible experience. I literally stopped reading the book 3 chapters before the story ends. I just couldn't.There was an excessive use of unnecessary side characters and side 'quests'. The whole part of Jack Sawyer in the tavern was useless and so painful to read.The transitions between certain scenes were unclear in many cases. One minute someone is completely well, the next page they are sick and dying. I felt the flow wasn't seamless.Stephen King you are a genius, but it didn't show here.
