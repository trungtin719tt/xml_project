Dear MisterCharles Bukowski,As you are always blunt, allow me to be blunt once. IsChuck Palahniukyour son? Not necessarily legitimate one or loved one, but son nevertheless.Why I am asking this? Because in "Choke" C.Palahniuk chooses this style, that can be described as realism (real life, everyday based writing), but it's quite familiar to your own style, Mr. C.Bukowski. And while you describe your everyday life and surroundings with "this life sucks" manner, I guess Mr. Palahniuk wanted to reach a Guinness world record of most people vomiting while reading a book. I know, it's a style, free speech and etc., but some scenes are too nasty, even if we are warned way before falling face first into it.I heardAmerican Psychohad quite similar detailed yuck stuff description scenes, and not everybody can stomach that. And well, in this book mister-might-be-your-son Chuck, writes about this character, that well, we all can relate somehow, but we aren't that sympathetic to him. It's like listening to someones confession, but you serve just like a bucket - but you just want the poor person to shut up. His mom is another matter - she is batshit crazy all the time.I guess his book was supposed to be about redemption, even coming of age one, but even if I finished reading this, I didn't get any sense of relief (more like thousand crows shit on me). I don't know if it's a good or a bad feeling. I guess bad.So, Mister Charles, take some DNR tests soon. You might be surprised.Always somewhere around,SadSunday.
