This book cost me around 600 dollars.When I'm traveling to and from conventions, I use the airplane time to catch up on my reading. A lot of times this means I'm taking the opportunity to read books that have been popular for a while, but that I haven't gotten around to. I feel like I should be aware of the landscape.Anyway, on my way home from Seattle, I had a layover in Minneapolis. I grabbed this book so I'd have something to read while I was eating dinner in the airport.So I ate dinner, and I read the book, and I lost track of time, and I missed my plane.I ended up having to rent a car and drive the three and a half hours back to Stevens Point.You win this round, Cassandra Clare....
