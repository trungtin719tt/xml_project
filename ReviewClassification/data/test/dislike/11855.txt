I thought Erich Segal's "Love Story" would be great. I really did, considering all the hype that has lasted for decades. But...There was no chemistry at all between Oliver and Jenny--The Couple. The only thing they have in common is they like to swear a lot--which got too old too soon in the book. I mean, Oliver had way more chemistry with Phil, his wife's dad, than with his own wife.Neither characters were likable or relatable. We don't get to know them at all. All we know is that Oliver is a rich kid who loves Jenny more than money or his own father. And Jenny is this poor, smart musician who became a teacher and calls her dad by his first name.The only actual loving relationship I cared about was not the one between the couple but between the dad and son--and that was the relationship that wasn't explored at all except for when Segal sneaks in a lame attempt at reconciliation on the last page.If love means not ever having to say you're sorry, then it's good that I don't love this book because I am sorry for having read it.
