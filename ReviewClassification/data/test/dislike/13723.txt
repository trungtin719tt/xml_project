Although I had issues overcoming some of the poor writing line to line in this book: "He smiled for maybe a tenth of a second," on the whole, this book does what it sets out to do.It's a clever little pop-spirituality diatribe about Bach's view of the world, which is not a horrible one. It has a cool gimmick that makes it work. I can't endorse its message outright, - and you can probably guess some of the narcissistic tendencies of the work from the subtitle - but Bach is pretty straightforward from the outset that what he's doing is telling you what it would be like if a real-life messiah met him and then taught him how to join the holy club.Yea, that's the premise of the book, but Bach has some beautiful passages - learning to walk on water, flying around the Midwest(in a plane), and a couple good thought provoking aphorisms along the way.It's also 180 pages, big print. Need to kill an hour or two with a book that has some beauty? Read this. If you can't stand "self-indulgent" writing, then you will not like this book.
