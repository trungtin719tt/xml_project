I feel like I should write two reviews for this, one for the majority of the book and one for the ending.Catherine (Cat) Crawfield started out as a bad-ass, tough woman; who was an intelligent, take-charge leader. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way we lost that character. Through the majority of "Destined for an Early Grave", the 4th book in the Night Huntress series, the reader is forced to listen to the inner dialogue of a woman with a very low self-esteem. When did Cat become this woman?!Have you ever had a female friend who would sit around and whine about the horrible problems in her relationship, while blaming everything on herself? Didn't you just want to scream and slap your friend to wake her up?! Are you really going to let him treat you like that?! Are you going to sit back and cry over losing him while he treats you like a doormat?!Of course, if this book wasn't written from only Cat's point of view, then we might have known that her love, "Bones" was not the total jerk that we thought he might be. That is a serious downside when writing a book from only one viewpoint. Unfortunately, it ruined this book for me. I spent too much time pissed off at Bones and couldn't really enjoy the book. Although there was an apology, Cat never actually demanded one. Instead, she was willing to move on without even getting one.hhhmmm.... keep secrets from me, treat me like a child, flip out when I do what I think is best with the limited information that I have, break my heart, publicly humiliate me.... oh, but since I have some of the blame in it, I'll just forget your part and beg for your forgiveness. *puke*The action in this book was fantastic. The other characters are always intriguing and I'm glad to see that some books have been written about them. The ending was good. Maybe the next book will have Cat back to her kick-ass, smart, independent self. I missed her in this book.
