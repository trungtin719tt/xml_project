I think my favorite line of "poetry" from this book is "He made love to me like a farmer!" She then goes on to talk about milking cows and tilling the land while describing their love making. Maybe I've just known too many farmers in my life and found none of them in the least bit attractive. There is nothing romantic about the smell of manure on a man. And anyway, I think that line sums up the depth of this book pretty well. From the first chapter I knew I was in trouble when one of the leading ladies ends up doing "it" in the forest, in a log, with a stranger. Ugh. I kept reading just because I had heard such great things about her first book, but I was really disappointed. The plot never thickened beyond the farm lust and i just found myself getting more and more angry at her heroines. I can handle people in a book not making the same choices I would have made, but it has to be well written prose to keep me hooked. I actually returned this book to B&amp;N because I couldn't stand to read the last four chapters and I seriously wanted my money back AND I didn't want any book on my shelf that had a line like "he made love to me like a farmer" in it. UGH!!!
