Hmmm... I felt disappointed with this one. The end was just wrapped up to quickly, and the treatment and tragic end to some characters - SPOILER - Claudine!? why dismiss her death in this way? I was also sad that Tray died....so which vampire did Niall mean when he told Sookie that at the very end? my initial thought was that it had to be Eric, because Niall didn't really know Bill.It seems like CH is starting to formulate an ending here - things are slowly wrapping up. I have a feeling that something major is going to happen with the blood bond between Eric and Sookie - in fact, it may even have been that Eric was in the process of breaking it when Sookie was held hostage and tortured... could that be why he could not come to help her?
