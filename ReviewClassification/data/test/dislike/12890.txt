I thought the premise of this book was brilliant. Following two friends, a boy and girl, who had a romantic encounter of sorts on their final graduation day, and seeing a glimpse into their lives every year on the same day after.I loved the detailed pop culture references, that maybe you can only truly appreciate had you grown up in London, and that made me yearn for my home town more than usual.That is where my like for this book ended. Because in general I thought it was quite monotonous, it dragged in places, there was unnecessary exposition and dialogue, I personally felt all the characters were unlikeable (bar Dexter's mother) and terrible stereotypical creations; last but definitely not least, there was a ridiculously pointless death.A death, may I add, that was the second most interesting character, (I guess... at a push.) But aparently Nicholls doesn't like to allow his female protagonists to live. No. He likes to strike them down in the prime of life, like a sadistic god who has nothing better to do with his plot and character development.But really, rather than rant for longer than this, because I am tired, and bored, and hot and have run out of ice lollies so am also a little cranky, and already feel like I wasted too much time on this book, and and and... I direct youhere, to this brilliant review. Because it says it all and more.Other than the City of Angels love. That's just a little weird.
