My god.Reading Howl was like getting stuck for an hour in the brain of a rebellious, pubescent, sexist loudmouth. Between every sentence transpires the hubris of being THE NEW POET, and of being A COOL OUTCAST, and a member of that little BOYS CLUB Ginsberg brings up again and again although it weakens his writing every time.There's a faint, insufferable music of puerility behind it all : most notably when Ginsberg brings up constantly the names of his famous friends, brings down women and (ew!) vaginas, and of course relapses into phallic metaphors every two pages.Love-child of an angsty teen, a 1950's jock and a wannabe anarchist, the book is always on the verge of being good, always grazing brilliance for a word or two, for a verse or two, and then back to complacent, biographical, drunken mediocrity.I heard so much about his poetry. I heard so much about the Beats Generation. My bookstore has a special, swagger section just for them pretty boys, you know. The more I read them though, the more I see how terribly overrated they are, just as a bunch of privileged bullies would be in a common high school.For a reason I cannot begin to fathom, they just kept up the illusion going in the literary community instead of peaking at 17.I don't see what Ginsberg brings to the table; what he invented, what he created with this; I don't see, read, feel the HOWL he's trying (is he even trying?) to express.
