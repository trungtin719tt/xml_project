*******THERE ARE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW!!!**********I have been told by SO MANY PEOPLE to read books by Chuck Palahniuk! I do enjoy the twisted irony in writings such as Kurt Vonnegut, and other similar authors, so I came to this book WANTING to LOVE it...and it "fell" flat.What I disliked in the book was the complete disregard for reality/common sense, when convenient, or necessary for plot. Now, I know it's fiction, but if you are going to write in a realistic style, then you can't just have someone hijack a plane in a book (before he's even ON the plane...as if the security would actually let Tender board the plane...he would have been shot dead on the spot in real life!)and get away with it, or have a formerly devoted religious cult member become a mass murderer, then suddenly lack the balls to shoot his own brother. If Adam was really this embittered killer, he would have been able to blow away Tender with no problem... and Fertility as well. And Fertility...how can she pretend she's a surrogate mother, but really be barron? How would she keep getting clients?? It's nagging questions like this that truly kept me from enjoying the book.Sure, the shock factor was there, and sometimes it was more than predictable (I'm sorry, but I KNEW that lobster was gonna be alive!!). Survivor was definitely an entertaining read, but it didn't have this lasting affect on me, as it did for many of my friends.I am an artist/visual person, I can really get into Palahniuk's imagery. That was totally hissaving gracein this book. The flowers, the lips and the gun, the porn, the statue of Tender, the telephone...all of these images were really striking and I can see why this book is being used for a movie. It will be as good as Fight Club, I predict. Strong imagery sticks in your subconscious and if this book is lasting for me in any way, it's several scenes that I can see as perfectly as a picture or a film real.But honestly, I think he's overrated. That's just my opinion. I'm debating whether or not I want to go into another book of his. I feel that I will know what to expect,and find the same characters, slightly altered...with a different name, maybe a hat, but the same critical flaws. At least Kurt Vonnegut had some original concepts in his books!!
