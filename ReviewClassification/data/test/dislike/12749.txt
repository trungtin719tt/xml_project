When I heard this was the book that inspired The Miracle Worker, I really thought it was going to revolve around Anne Sullivan and the difficult process of breaking through the barrier of blindness and deafness to get to Helen Keller. I remember vague details of the play (and movie) from way back in middle school, and remember thinking then how interesting it all was.This wasn't the case with this book. What this book dives into is Keller's life after all the events of The Miracle Worker. Which is completely fine. I fully grasp why Keller wanted to share these moments of her life. It's just not what I thought it would be about, and couldn't really hold my attention. I'll admit it is difficult for a non-fiction book to really grab me and hold my attention, and this was simply just not a book for me.
