If you wanna know about fly fishing, or what life was like with the U.S. Forest Service in the early 1900s, these stories are for you.A river runs through it was quite good. A story of a family, not too vocal with their love for one another- but it's there. And facing the trouble of wishing you could help another, but also knowing as much as you try, sometimes you can't. Though, to get to this, you have to get through a lot of fly fishing.
