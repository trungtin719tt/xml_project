I hated this book. I was especially angry that I couldn't find it at the library and had to go all over looking for it, and all that effort was wasted. I'm not sure exactly why we read it for book club, because the main female character was the complete opposite of strong. She was mealy-mouthed and pathetic, but I got the feeling that we, the readers, were supposed to sympathize with her anyway. As opposed to the author implying, "here is a despicable example of a woman, one who gets pregnant and decides that she must kill herself rather than deal with it, even though she seemed to have reasonable and supportive family and friends, so don't be like that!" OK, OK, so she was depressed; fine, I get it. Get some help! Grow a pair! She couldn't even kill herself by herself!I kept reading all the way to the end anyway, because despite the lousy writing I was rather curious to find out who did the shooting...did she kill herself, or did the boyfriend do it? Was she possibly killed by aliens? I felt that there must be some interesting reason, some clever twist, to make this whole disaster of a book worth reading. But no. And in fact, the ending was so unimpressive I can't even remember what happened.
