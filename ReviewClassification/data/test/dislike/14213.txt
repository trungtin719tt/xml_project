If I weren't embarrassed to admit publicly that I'm addicted to this series, I'd have a t-shirt made that said, "Slay Stevie Rae." She is the epitome of annoyance, along with Rephaim, Kalona, the stupid non-twins, and Jack, the squeaking boyfriend (Damien deserves better, I think). But...here I am, finished with this book the day after it's release.The first 100 pages are a waste...meaningless dialogue that I doubt the authors even understand themselves. But, for those of us who can't seem to tear ourselves away from the series and are looking for a happy ending (well, for now, since we're apparently a long way from the end...I'm actually kicking myself for beginning), you won't be disappointed at the end of this one.
