i've found that with tom robbins' novels, you either love it or hate it. i hated this one. disappointing since so many people have told me that i "HAD" to read it, assured that i would just love it. for the record, i liked 'still life with woodpecker' and 'skinny legs and all.' i didn't care for 'even cowgirls get the blues' and thought this one was so full of shit that the topic of perfume was so sorely needed to cover the overwhelming stench. maybe i just wasn't in the right mindset. maybe i'm over his pompous prose and veiled quasi-misogynistic crap. maybe i just don't like old white guys writing southern black women in phonetics. oooh-ee, massa, tom robbins ain't no race-iss. tom robbins an ar-teest, mm-hmm. take a flying leap, jitterbug perfume. twilight was more entertaining than you.(i'm going to get so much flack for this. i can feel it coming. but really, what the hell do i know? i'm just one dumb woman, right?)
