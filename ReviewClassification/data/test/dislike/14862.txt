Warning: Rant IncomingThis pretty much sums up the relationship between me and other readers of this book:I just don't get the love for this book. Reason being, the freakin' annoying and stupid characters.Ugh!! I have never, I repeat never, been so annoyed with a character in all my life like I was with Kiera. Hate is such a strong word, but yeah, I hate her. She is a selfish, cheating bitch. Yeah, that's right, I said it. Bitch wants to have her cake and eat it, too. She shouldn't be able to have it that way but she gets it.See, even LaLa agrees with me. Gahhhh, what I wouldn't give to smack the shit out of her.And let's not forget the guys in this story. Denny, the ever faithful and blissfully unawares boyfriend:And Kellan, the douchebag musician:I'm not sure what the hell was going on with those guys. Keira must have some seriously good*ahem*or has magical voodoo powers to have them both put up with her. Can someone please tell me her appeal?The ending had me all WTF.(view spoiler)[ Denny still keeps in touch with her even though she repeatedly cheated on him and led a double life with Kellan. Kellan waits around for her even though she still couldn't make her mind up between the two of them. Of course, that is up until the very end, when the choice was made for her. Seriously, the bitch should have ended up alone at the end. This shit just does not happen. What am I saying? That asshat of a couple deserve each other.(hide spoiler)]I just can't with this book.And you mean to tell me that her story continues on in further books? Hmmm, shall I continue on to find out what happens to our lovely heroine?
