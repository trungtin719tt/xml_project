I am trying to like this book because for some reason I think that I should.But, in truth, I am finding it quite dull and painfully slow.Maybe I lack in patience or sophistication, because--given other reviews of this book--there is a good chance I am missing something (or simply haven't read enough into it yet--apparently it gets good after the tedious first 100 pages...)But so far, I am pretty seriously bored and disintersted in his saga about rich people, poor misunderstood movie stars and their shallow love affairs, dull parties and dumb problems. I keep thinking of that Edie Sedgwick movie for some reason...(no offense to Edie or Andy, or Scott for that matter!)Every once in a while there is a great line though, so, hey.And, I do so love the name of this book--five stars for that at least!OK, now I feel justified in my dislike of this book:their night: by bukowski"never could read Tender Is theNightbut they've made atv adaptation of thebookand it's been runningfor severalnightsand i have spentten minuteshere and therewatching the troubles ofthe richwhile they are leaningagainst their beach chairsin Niceor walking about theirlarge roomsdrink in hand whilemaking philosophicalstatementsorfucking upat thedinner partyor thedinner dancethey really have noideaof what to do withthemselves:swim?tennis?drive up thecoast?findnew beds?lose oldones?orfuck with thearts and theartists?having nothing to struggleagainstthey have nothing to strugglefor.the rich are differentall rightso is the ring-tailedmaki and thesandflea."Thanks Hank (and Rob!) :)
