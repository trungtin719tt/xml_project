I was waiting for a flight, desperate for reading material, so I picked this up at the airport book stall. I read the summary on the back cover and decided it sounded better than a James Patterson book, but definitely wasn't going to set my world on fire. Wow, was I right.About a third of the way through, I was shaking my head at the complete and utter CHEESINESS of the story. So, I checked the front flap for the author's name and other works to make a mental note to avoid them in the future. I was certain it would be a female author; this book has all the hallmarks of girly, escapist fiction. But no, HIS name is Nicholas Sparks......hmmmmm, never heard of him. Then, I saw the list: The Notebook, Nights in Rodanthe, A Walk to Remember.....good grief, how did I miss this when I made my purchase? It should be noted that while I enjoy a good romance as much as the next girl, I try VERY hard to avoid cheese. (Except Twilight. I'll admit it; I read that series.) In fact, I was once forced by my little sister to watch the movie, The Notebook, and I have never laughed so hard in my life. Or felt so ashamed. But, I digress...Not only is the story cheesy, but Mr. Sparks seems to follow a cookie cutter pattern for his books, as well. Admittedly, I haven't read any of his other books, but enough of them have been made into movies that I've picked up the general gist. Let me see if I can predict his next book, shall we??? Emotionally unavailable, slightly damaged male figure meets super sweet heroine that's probably had a few hard knocks (divorce, a death, single motherhood, whatever) in life and together they overcome some epic drama that leads them to the meaning of love. Sometimes it ends on a happily-ever-after note; sometimes one of them dies. Vomit.To all of you who enjoy Nicholas Sparks' books, I'm sorry. Really.
