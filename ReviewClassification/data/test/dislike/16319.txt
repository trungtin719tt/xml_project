Reluctantly admit to having read this subterranean book, and there is absolutely no excuse, as I SHOULD HAVE KNOWN BETTER, afterThe Alchemist. I only remembered having read it because I was trying to find something on my top shelf (the one with the "Let's forget I own them"-books), and it fell into my hands. A quick scan of its content reminded me that even quick scans are a waste of time when it comes to Coelho. Note to self: until I find the company of sheep more educating than reading, his "novels" are a no-go-area.Too harsh? Maybe. Am in a bad mood, as I can't find the book I really want to read!Sorry. Eleven minutes review over.
