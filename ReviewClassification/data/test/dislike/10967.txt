If you read past this, you will encounter very angry and unkind words said about the last part of this book. Beware if you enjoyed it, because I did notListen, I hate this ending for literally 100 reasons and since I am in a shit mood I will list some.(view spoiler)[1. Arya and him don't end up together. I'm not going to be that petty person that cries and hates a book because the love interest doesn't end up together but it was so poorly handled. Eragon has had 0 reason to be happy in 4 books. He had Saphira yes but otherwise all he had was his love for Ayra that was constantly denied anytime he tried to express how he felt. Then, we get to the end of the series and it's finally possible that maybe they can be together but nope, Mr. Paolini decided that he had to create some weird situation where they won't be together. BUT to rub it in and make matters worse, the EXACT moment Eragon is being told he and Arya will not be together and that it's never going to happen, you get Saphira getting her happy moment with Arya's dragon. I just thought that was in poor taste and timing to do that.2. That brings me to problem number 2. I know I said I had 100 reasons and I have many more but I just am so upset that I don't care enough to talk about them all, but yeah this one is mybiggestproblem with this ending. Saphira and Eragon are my favourite fictional relationship I've ever encountered. It beats out every mom/daughter, sibling, relationship, friendship etc relationship I've ever read about and the last 10 or so chapters of the book has 0 of it. I understand that Saphira had a male dragon and yes I can understand why Paolini chose to include the dragon sex and all that because it was important, but I never imagined that the last 100 or whatever pages (2 hours of my audiobook) was going to be Saphira spending all of her time with him and 0 time with Eragon. Saphira and Eragon moments are what made this book series for me. It's why I read it to be quite frank and the fact that this author left me off with NONE of it was actually the biggest piss off in my reading history. Don't get me started on the fact that while Eragon was trying to come to terms with leaving home, Saphira was off getting laid. It honestly undermines their entire relationship and I just could go on and on and on right now about the many reasons why it's the stupidest part of the book. And the worst is that it's not like it had a purpose. I could see it if we got to see Saphira lay eggs and stuff then MAYBE I could understand, but no, we don't. We get no purpose other than their relationship disappears, Eragon is left to deal with everything alone and they don't even SPEAK for the entire end of the book. I just think he gave up too much for this kind of ending and I am unbelievably upset that he couldn't turn to Saphira for that.(hide spoiler)]Disappointed would be an understatement. This is not an ending an author gives to characters he cares about.
