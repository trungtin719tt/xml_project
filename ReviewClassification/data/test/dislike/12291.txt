Save for the cheesy dramas made of Danielle Steele's crappy books,I have never preferred books transferred to the screen. (In the case of Steele's books, at least on screen the characters become 3 dimensional). But in the case of the Sookie Stackhouse books, I am going to make another exception to the rule.The HBO series True Blood in raunchy, violent and vulgar, but it is also fabulously entertaining. And by introducing other 3 dimensional characters and other plot lines it doesn't force Sookie to carry the whole story. It's a whole world and one that draws you in, even if it disturbs you, both in terms of squeamishness and in terms of the fact that you KNOW it ain't exactly Masterpiece Theater!But the Harris books are told in the first person and are reminding me painfully of the most notorious "Mary Sue" to come down the pike in years, Bella Swan of the Vampire-Series-That-Must-Not-Be-Named.I will continue to read these mainly to pass the time until summer when series 2 of True Blood should return to HBO. And I am looking forward to seeing how they will take Harris's pedestrian prose and turn it on its head into really good entertainment.....
