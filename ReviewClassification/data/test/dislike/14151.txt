UPDATE: to watch my non-spoiler book review + book talk on RED QUEEN click below:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cl0-p...I have a lot of feelings about this book. Few of them are good, some... aren't so good. I actually knew I wouldn't truly be able to rate it until after I thought about it for a few days, and I'm pretty content with my rating as of now.There is a lot of hype surrounding this book, that much is obvious. I read it for the Carpe Librum Book Pick of the Month for February. Overall, I'm a tad disappointed with all the hype because I was expecting this amazing new YA novel. In the end, I knew this wasn't the greatest debut novel, or start in the trilogy I've ever read. In the end, all I can really say is:I've read this story before.Many many times.Before I get into that, I wanted to first mention the characters. Mare was a typical wishy-washy indecisive YA heroine. To say she was annoying is putting it lightly.For the three main dudes of the story, Cal, Maven, and Kilhorn. I don't have too much to say without giving away plot details, but I think I liked Cal and Maven's interactions the most out of any relationship in the story. There was just something there between the two brothers that I really enjoyed.The world-building. Interesting enough, it wasn't until after I read it that the author actually envisioned a Grecian/Roman society with electricity. Yeah... I didn't get that at all. The "battles" in the beginning reminded me of gladiators, but the actual setting of the book? I didn't get Rome at all, which is a damn shame I didn't because I would have really liked that visual. Maybe the descriptions should have catered to a Rome/Greece setting which I don't believe it did. I ended up envisioning a Panem, which... didn't really help the cause (see below.)The powers. The Silvers are born with powers, the Reds are not, therefore the Reds are essentially the slaves. This was an awesome concept. However I felt like the rules on the Silvers' powers weren't explained, didn't have limits where there should have been. The Queen is a whisper, therefore she can root through people's minds, control them, etc. While I was reading it, I just couldn't buy into Mare's conspirating plans with the rebels when the queen is right. there. It left me thinking, 'Why isn't the Queen squashing all these plans?' It was a huge flaw for me because this is a major part of the book (and length of the book.) The powers for the Silvers worked to a point, but only when it benefited to the plot of the story. Then they went into the weird loop-hole, unexplained limbo. There needed to be cap on how much power was too much for these Silvers. It made them less human and left me thinking of too many plot-holes.However, this year, I have been paying A LOT of attention to the writing. I thoroughly enjoyed the way RQ was written. The pacing, transitions, everything was very well done. I honestly had a very hard time putting this book down once the action started to rise towards the climax. The book could have done with a lot less "perfectly arched eyebrows" tbh.The romance is pretty light in the book and meh... it didn't stir any feelings in me. I don't ship Mare with anyone. Actually, I preferred them all separate. Individually, they were ok characters and I didn't really think the romance was particularly necessary. I do wish the author would have built the relationship with Cal and Mare a whole hell of a lot more. I would have felt something at the end moreso than I did because I didn't... I don't know, feel those "stakes" as they were so-called "raised." A few dance lessons and looks at dinner parties wasn't a "love" relationship to me.So, now onto the fact that I felt I already read this story. I was reminded WAY too many times of other YA fantasy/dystopian books. Just off the top of my head I thought of all these books while I was reading: The Hunger Games, The Gates of Thread and Stone, Cinder, The Darkest Minds, The Selection, Throne of Glass, and lastly Shadow &amp; Bone. To me, that was just too many. I mean sure, books remind us of other books all the time, but this was the first time where I saw way too many similarities that it took me OUT of this story many times. There was a disconnect between me and the book. And I also want to list some of these similarities so below are some slightly spoilery plot points, but not huge ones that would ruin major plot twists:The Hunger Games:- Mare has a perfect younger sister named not-Prim, but she might as well have been.- The government is using Mare to distract from the real problems in the society.- Furthermore, the rebels are using Mare as the face of their campaign to take down the government.- Kilhorn is the pre-page one love interest aka Gale, who joins the rebellion because... he's Gale.- Tributes... I mean Silvers try to one-up each other in the training room before being put in "arenas" for one-on-one battles.- Maven is known for his words and speaking to the public (where is brother, Cal fails at,) much like Peeta is. (Also, Maven points out his favorite bakery to Mare when they get to the capital. Does he decorate cakes, too?)- Mare's government-issued speech to the Reds had me like, "Panem today, Panem tomorrow, Panem forever..."Shadow &amp; Bone:- These similarities aren't as obvious as THG ones were, but the again Kilhorn reminded me of Mal, the fact that both were fast-tracking it into the army for this never-ending war just reminded me too much of Shadow &amp; Bone.- Also the fact that Mare comes into her powers under strenous circumstances and because that special gurl people either hate or trip over was very much how Alina's character arc was formed.Cinder:- Meeting the Prince outside of the palace and forming this bond and special connection, giving no one else a chance.The Selection:- The Queenstrial is literally the entire Selection Trilogy summarized in like two chapters. (but bravo RQ on that one xD)So for me, RED QUEEN just... didn't feel original to me. It's YA recycling at its best. And that was a shame.
