I feel terrible right now. I mean THIS IS THE MARY POPPINS BOOK THAT IS SO FAMOUS ALL OVER THE UNIVERSE. And I'm rating it 2-stars?! What iswrongwith me?! So right now, I'm mortally embarrassed and a little ashamed, but if I'm going to review books honestly, I have to go in this direction.Let's have some positives first, though, shall we?I love how magical the story is!The adventures Mary Poppins takes the children on? They're incredible! Only a few were in the movie, so most of them were new to me. I loved the wildness. Gosh, the author has a seriously incredible imagination.Writing?It's really fabulous. That very old omni-present style...I really do like it. It's not cluttered with detail. And can we spare a moment for the NAME "Mary Poppins"? It's catchy. You just want to say it all over the place.Okay! So let's get down to the grit...what did I hate?Um...I really did NOT like Mary Poppins herself. Why? She was a) condescending, b) rude, and c) unloving. The FIRST thing she does when she waltzes into their lives (without invitation) is to give the children some mysterious medicine. I'm pretty sure it was hallucinatory drugs that enabled them to fall in love with her. Because why else would they have liked her so much? She. was. mean. She was always telling them to shut up and come along and be quiet and go to bed and GO HOME. Yes. At one stage, this nanny told Michael (he must be around 5 or 6) to walk home because heaskedif they were nearly finished shopping. WHAT?! This woman is not fit to look after children!I did like Bert and the sidewalk drawings, though.They were very like the movie. Especially when they hopped into the picture!Also:- What did Mrs. Banks do all day?- Would you hire a nanny and not maybe sort of question if she was an axe-murderer first?- Where did Bert actually live? (Why was he not a chimney sweep?!)- I think someone needed to check Miss Lark's mental health.- There are 4 children! Jane and Michael are the oldest, but then there's one-year-old twins called Barbara and John!- Is Mary Poppins an escaped Hogwarts teacher? I'm pretty sure she's Slytherin.I didn't like this book. I thought Mary Poppins' was cruel/condescending to the children and not the kind of influence I'd want inmykids' lives. (Not that I have kids, but whatever.) Unfortunately this was a pretty sad introduction to this famous story for me.PS. The movie is better.
