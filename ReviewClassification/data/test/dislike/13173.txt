"Palahniuk, dude... this book is sort of gross.""Sort of gross? Of course it's sort of gross, man, it's the world that's gross.""No, I mean, like, gratuitously gross. Gross for the sake of being gross. That sort of gross.""Hey, man. I call 'em like I see 'em. You don't like the grossness of my book? Check out how gross the WORLD is sometimes. You should be more worried about that than about how gross my book is.""All right, I understand that. Gross with a purpose. Right. What do you propose we do about this grossness?""Tear it all down and start over.""All right. How do you think we should go about that?""We don't even need to consider it, man, it'll happen by itself. Society will get too disgusting to do anything but wallow in its own morass, and when it does, something new will spring up, and when something new springs up, that's when the grossness will stop and we'll get to move onto something bigger.""O... kay. Let's, um, let's move away from grossness-""You can't. It's everywhere.""Away from grossness and over to this hero of yours. He's kind of boring, really. Just this one-dimensional asshole with no real personality characteristics beyond being a gross nihilist.""A lot of people are like that, man. He's part of the problem.""I suppose that's fair, but look. The dude has, like, two personality traits. He's more defined by what he does than who he is. 'Works at a colonial village' and 'is a sex addict' don't really count as characterization. They're the extra details you graft onto a character after we have a sense of their motivations, their temperament, their ambitions, their fears, their backstory if need be. David Foster Wallace wrote a bazillion similarly fucked-up characters inThe Pale King, which the prospective reader should read instead of this, but he allowed them to be actual real people instead of just an accumulation of things they do.""Man, you don't get it. I did that on purpose. Victor Mancini is representative of the empty person who lives a life of shallow hedonism and self-satisfaction. He is the modern man who has ruined our modern society so thoroughly. He is a corrupting force who needs to go. This book is about why.""And yet he's present at the symbolic rebuilding-of-society, as evidenced by the Nihilism 101 ending you graft onto this book. So what you're telling me is the shallow, empty-headed morons will inherit the earth?""Um...""This is what you suggested in Fight Club. And Lullabye. And probably a couple of others.""He literally shovels shit. That's symbolic, man. It's a metaphor for how he has dedicated his life to shit-shoveling in a symbolic sense, what with his absurd levels of self-worship and all. We are the generation of chickens hatched from shaken eggs. This is us. This is our world. We have degraded ourselves so thoroughly that we have gotten what we deserved.""Right-o, buddy, okay. Let me know how that worldview works out for you."This book is funny sometimes.
