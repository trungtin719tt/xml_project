This book has a very interesting premise, that everybody considers different things to be acts of love, and that if you're not speaking the same "love language" as your partner, it's possible that what you consider to be loving isn't interpreted as such.However I found this book to be really limited. It focuses on married heterosexual couples. I think this concept would be really interesting applied in family situations, or for unmarried couples (honestly, shouldn't these things be discussed and figured out before marriage?), or for gay couples.I also feel that there is a lot missing here in terms of trauma, abuse and consent. Some marriages cannot be saved. That is an OK thing. It is not always appropriate to determine what your spouse or partner's love language is when you're in a traumatic, abusive or nonconsensual situation. I realize that this isn't a book focusing on that, but even a few sentences thrown in would have been nice.
