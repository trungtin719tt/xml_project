The majority of my friends loved this book! But, I didn't and I hate that I didn't!I love Patrick Ness but this book just wasn't for me and I won't be reading the rest of the trilogy. I will continue to read Patrick Ness books =)I loved the whole concept of the book and it was cray. BUT, so much of the book made me feel crazier than I am and gave me a headache. =(I'm so glad so many others enjoyed it because that's the beauty of books. I just wish I was one of them. Sigh......
