I too, am one of those folks that was totally in love with Outlander and, despite some rather graphic violence, thought it was a good enough book that I have continued to read the series up to this one. Unforunately, like most series, this one does not get better. By this book DG is reusing plots that we've already seen and the characters are becoming two dimensional caricatures of themselves. Jamie, the tough masculine hero, Claire, the strong and fiesty woman that knows how to handle her man, the fiery Scots, the stereotypical early Americans. I gave it two stars because I did finish the book and found it entertaining at points, but I also found it a bit high-handed and offensive at time. The overall sense I had at the end was "I wish someone else I know had read this book so they can just tell me what happens, because I can't deal with another 1800 pages of these characters!"
