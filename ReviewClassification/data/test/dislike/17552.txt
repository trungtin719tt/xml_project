I honestly don't know why I'm still reading this series. Maybe as ridiculous as the story gets, I want to know how it will end. I'm thinking I've slugged through seven books already so 2, 3 more shouldn't be too hard... but by the looks of it, the authors will probably churn out 8 more books before this series ends. They're bringing Heath back for cryin' out loud. C'mon, didn't we read an entire book mostly about Heath dying and finally being happy in the Otherworld? And it seems that they're bringing him back in Neferet's "vessel" and he'll be the tiny flicker of good in an otherwise evil creation. Uh, isn't that the same as Rephaim's story? And why bother with bringing Heath back when the awesomeness that is James Stark is already with Zoey? And that bit about Kalona having access to Stark? I didn't like it AT ALL. If the authors decide to make Stark bad again just to make Heath look good, I'm done with this series. Stark's pretty much the only character I like at this point. Rephaim, Stevie Rae and Aphrodite are okay I guess. The rest are so annoying, Zoey first and foremost. And aside from Zoey's gang and Lenobia, is everyone in the House of Night so frakking dumb that they go with Neferet's pronouncements right after they've seen and heard what Nyx had to say? That to me is a cop-out. It seemed like the authors were willing to make everyone else stupid just so they could get on with the story. Another thing I hate is all those pop-culture references that doesn't add anything to the story. It only makes the characters sound childish and cheap - trying too hard to be hip and "now" - removing any chance of the story being timeless. I guess it doesn't matter since the books are raking in profits now. And that may also be the reason why this series isn't ending any time soon, recycled characters and story lines be damned.
