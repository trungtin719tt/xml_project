i never finished this book, and i don't particularly plan to.i mean sure, it's funny, it's sad, it has its moments. i got involved with the graphic and emotionally staggering descriptions of his parents. and this guy has had a pretty intense life if this is his memoir. recognition must be given for that. fine. but the preface? the rules? dear lord. the last thing i need to read is the self-indulgent self-obsessed tale of a self-centric and self-aggrandizing smart kid. i have enough of those around me in real life, and i tend to tune out when they start talking.i stopped reading at part two when he starts up might magazine. does it get better after that? let's hope, for the sake of the pulitzer committee that decided to make it a finalist. i rarely just give up on books like this, so a part of me wants to pick up again just to know what happens. and to know why it was so wildly popular.but then again, i don't particularly like mcsweeney's. maybe that's my problem. i don't know. read it if you want. meh.
