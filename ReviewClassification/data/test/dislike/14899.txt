I have had 4-5 people tell me over the years that I ought to read this book, so after Jean read it I kept it around the house. And one evening when I had finished a book and wasn't all that sleepy, I picked this up.And it made me very sleepy. Lots of sleepy nights with this selection.Yes, and he's a good writer and this has a few nice little anecdotes.But jeez, it's just not a very interesting or very good book, that's all. Let's see, it's by a guy who doesn't really like to hike (he'd rather be walking in England than hiking in the woods, which he basically says 10 different ways, creeps him out). Yet, he decides he wants to walk the Appalachian Trail and write a book about it. So he gets together with a fat, not-very-nice smoker, and then mostly writes about how strange other people are out on the trail.In fact, the book mostly relies on our two heroes running into people that they find goofy -- or who they simply don't like and want to make fun of. Sorry, not all that gripping. For the record, I loved "Measure of a Mountain," by Bruce Barcott. But maybe that's because Barcott loved being in the mountains and expressed it well.
