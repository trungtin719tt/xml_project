Toni Morrisonis an absolute master of prose rhythms and this book is beautifully written. It reads like great literature and one can see why she's deserving of her nobel prize. But I had a serious problem with this book (which I read over ten years ago so forgive me if my memory of it is vague). The first three quarters of the book are terrific. Written in a realistic style and capturing the modern lives of its characters. The final section of the book suddenly turns into a fable, and the main character, formerly a realistically drawn urban black youth, is now suddenly an African folk hero with almost supernatural abilities, largely having to do with moving through the woods better than white people. I realize that this occurs because he's finally come to respect and value his past (and traced his ancestry back to the first member of his family to be brought to America as a slave) but the transformation is so sudden and abrupt as to feel totally unearned. And, I think Morrison's call to recognize the importance and value of your past, and the empowerment it can provide (particularly for a now-oppressed people who have been taught by the power structure that they are worth less than other cultural groups) is vital and true--so why not demonstrate the real worth of coming to value your past? Why not show how the main character's awakening helps him grow in a realistic way, and makes him better able to navigate his actual, urban life? Instead, he suddenly gets super-powers to help him in the woods, and overnight transforms the way he treats women (why not show a real transformation, where he has to grapple with his own awakening to his misogyny and learn to move past it?). And, why is his journey to understanding his heritage fulfilled with the first slave in his family? Morrison hints that his family has a long and important history in Africa, but apparently that's not worth his exploring.
