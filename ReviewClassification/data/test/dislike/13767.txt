A very rare case where the screenplay adaption provided a richer, better story than the novel. Gump started out familiar and ended that way as well. However, the middle portion was almost unreadable as I do like a grain of believably even with this type of story. There were times where I thought Winston Groom was going through the motions and seeing how far-fetched he could make the storyline. If I were not already comparing vs the movie - which I loved - then I probably would have put the book down. If you decide to read Gump - then be fair warned that it is only a distant relative to the movie.
