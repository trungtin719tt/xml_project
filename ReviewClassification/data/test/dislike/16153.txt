WARNING: I might be an asshole in this review...and there will be few spoilers here and there, as well as a lot of profanityFirst of all, I don't give a slightest shit about any of the characters in this book, especially Brandy Alexander, Queen Supreme, AKA Princess Princess. She is a pill popping, surgery obsessed, not giving a crap about anybody else kind of a bitch. She goes around judging people, showing them catalogs that have different plastic surgeries that she can get, even vaginoplasty. She is obsessed with looking good and she pops pills like crazy.The main character has an accident that leaves her unable to talk. She tries to deal with this problem as best as possible but it is easier said than done. She meets Brandy and they go on a spree of stealing shit and finding as many places to take prescription pills as possible. Brandy tries to help the narrator and tells her unless she stops thinking about the past and the present, she will never be happy in the future, or some shit like that.We also learn about how the narrator's brother was gay and how he died of AIDS. Her parents talk about their son like he was an apple of their eye, forgetting that they bashed his way of life when they found out about it. Now that he is dead, the narrator is supposed to get all the attention, but she doesn't since her parents are obsessed over their dead son. They join a group of parents with homosexual children, and want to be good parents. They also give the narrator condoms (like five boxes of them) to the narrator (their daughter) while at the same time telling her about all the horrible sexually transmitted diseases she can get. Great parents, right?The ending I saw coming a mile away. Few twists here and there, but overall disappointing. I did not see the point of this book. You might think this is why I did not enjoy the book, but you are wrong. It is hard for me to read a book if every character is so unlikeable even I want to shoot them in their face.Anyway, a lot of talk about plastic surgery in this book, a lot of sexual themes (include mentions of oral sex, anal sex, porno magazines, sexual positions and/or sexual favors, plastic surgeries on sexual organs, and much more crap like that). The characters seem to like each other/tolerate each other in the beginning but it falls apart in the end.Luckily this was a quick read and the book cost e 75 cents. Otherwise I would not have picked up this steamy peace of crap even if you paid me. If i got anything wrong in this review, I just don't care. This was pretty disappointing book anyway.P.S. Sorry if my language offended you. I usually write shorter and cleaner reviews. I just hated this damn book that it made me temporarily crazy. I picked up another book so I am OK now. This one can be found in my trash bin.
