I was in the library when I walked by this book, while I was looking for another book. I pulled it off the shelf and because I've found and read some pretty amazing book with this randomness, I thought ok. Another reason I have become a little obsessed with shopping on ebay. I thought this girl book would be fun, it would be like a new girl friend, getting to now good and bad about her, how she thinks about life........... So, I checked it out and I read it in about 6 hours. Reason it sucked:1. The main charter was English so I didn't relate the stores that she was bragging about shopping at and it didn't have the SAME"sex in the city" LUSTFUL MATERIALISTIC effect on me . So, her prideful continuous description of these clothes she "owned" and was in debt for became ridiculous. And her constant shopping while in debt, actually started to physically stress me out.2. Half way into the book I felt really sad because I know that there is so many people who this is their reality. This shallow mindset or consumption of caffeine, sugar, shopping, "fashion"..... the constant carve of distraction and never learning to deal. It just seemed to glorify being shallow and reinforce that if and when you are you should keep on being so because:3. The modern day fairy tale ending for could happen. Debt paid off, get the job you want, they guy, the clothes, the romance, the money, the fame..... It grasps on the the romantic notion of what life should be, and could be. It seem to encourage that there is nothing wrong with lying to yourself and others.4. It reminds of humans I know, who choose to lead the most dramatic, self indulged, objectified, diva lifestyle. Where they are the most important and beautiful person on the planet, and you'll regret being not trying to be their best friend (a.k.a. letting them use you) when they are Famous and rich one day. I think this book glamorize this attitude, and not matter how you dress that up, there is nothing glamorous about that.All and All I HAETED this book and wished I hadn't read the it. And if I could give a negative star I would. But I know this is not a hateful website.
