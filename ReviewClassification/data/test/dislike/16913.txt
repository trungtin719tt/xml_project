Damn but I hated this series. I found it completely ridiculous! I couldn't even finish the second book!For god's sake the plot is boring, the characters idiotic and the heroine... I want to kill the heroine!Bianca is actually a baby, and I don't mean the fact that she is 16, I mean that she is a naive, whiny, scared little girl who makes one bad decision after another!We also have the "admirers".Bachelor No1, "Lucas"... Lucas thinks himself a protector! Oh, but he is gorgeous! My cousin is gorgeous too, that does not a hero make!A brainwashed teenager, as ignorant as he is boring!Bachelor No 2 "Balthazar". The guy is centuries old and he still wants a teenage girl with insecurity issues!The fact that in the second book both of them run from friends and family in order to be together instead of standing their ground kind of tells us what kind of personalities we are reading about! Sure all heroes can't be perfect but these ones are as far from it as they come!
