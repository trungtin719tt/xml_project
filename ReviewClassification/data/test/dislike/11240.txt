Robert Ludlum is a terrible terrible writer of dialogue and had a terrible style.The man can, however, tell a story. That is why his books are translated very well into great action movies.but if i have to read one more line of the "oh john! oh marsha' bullcrap in his novels, i swear i will stab my eyes out with a fork. man on man, if that woman goes on anymore in her inner monologue about "that poor man! he couldn't stand it! not knowing who he was! and now he was . . . . blah blah bippity bladdy blah" i'd burn a book for the first time.Good fireplace material if you were trapped in a cabin in a blizzard.
