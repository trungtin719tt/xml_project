I really don't know why I keep reading these books. Maybe I'm hoping they'll get back to being as good as the first five books in the series. They were, I don't know,cozy. But not anymore.The whole point of this book is to deal with the events that happened at the end ofTempted. And really, that's it. It is painfully obvious that P.C. and Kristin Cast threw in that ending so they could cash in on another book resolving that ending. Quite literally, the first 250 pages of this book is every single character expressing their love for Zoey and how they must save her before the earth falls into some dark oblivion. To say the least, it was painfully boring.For the last two books, the Casts, for some reason, have thrown in these God-awful point-of-view changes. I'm all for hearing the story from different characters' points of view. But at least do it for a purpose. The Casts switch from character to character every five pagesfor no apparent reason. I mean, seriously, if Stevie Rae and Rephaim are in the same room, there's no need to change the POV mid-conversation. Also, almost every character's POV is given. Kalona, Stevie Rae, Zoey, Heath, Stark, Rephaim, and Aphrodite all have their turn up at bat. It was maddening. I understand two or even three POVs, but seven is a little much.Also, this cover is a little too fitting for this book. Stevie Rae (who was never a favorite of mine anyway) somehow becomes the main character of the story. I never,ever, thought I would say this, but I missed Zoey's point of view. She probably had ten pages of narration in the book, besides the end. Besides that, it was almost all Stevie Rae (of course, with other POVs randomly peppered in).And what is up with all the pathetically stereotypical characters? This is basically about the whole series, but I thought I could point it out while I'm ranting. First of all, Kramisha. P.C. and Kristin, just because you throw a black character into your book doesn't mean you have to make them sound completely uneducated and idiotic. Seriously, every quote from Kramisha has blatant grammatical errors in it. And why? Because she's supposed to be a "typical black teenager?" Please. And also, Jack and Damien's relationship bothers me to no end. I'm all for homosexuality in books (and in general) but don't make itthatirritatingly stereotypical. Their relationship is like a rainbow personified. And if I could shoot Jack in the face, I would.Okay, one last thing to rant about. The glaring grammatical errors. Do these people have an editor? There were too many points where they didn't punctuate correctly, didn't punctuate at all, or had random quotation marks in the middle of nowhere. I can accept simple comma errors and the like (don't we all misuse them from time to time?), but they pulled me out of the story.However, the ending was pretty good. Maybe it's because the ending was the only part whereanythingof substance happened, but still, it saved this book from getting one star.So, overall, this book failed. The only thing it did was solve a conflict the last book created. Nothing new at all. In my opinion, just skip it and read the next book if you feel inclined to do so. You'll catch up very easily.My love for this series has been shot to the ground, so I'm not excited for the next one. But will I buy it? Probably. :/...an affinity forelectricity? Seriously?!
