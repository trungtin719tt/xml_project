I still don't understand the point of this book.Maybe because I kept wanting to DNF it. Nothing picked up my interest through the whole thing. The only reason I never gave up reading was because it's such a fast read and I was ashamed to DNF it. I can even say I didn't understand anything after the 75%, I just kind of skimmed the pages to end it sooner.
