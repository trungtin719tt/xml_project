This was a fun story. It had a bit of action, a bit of mystery, and plenty of crazy humor. The story was fast paced and pretty light in tone for the most part, but it did have a few dark happenings that injected some tension into the story.Down on her luck Stephanie Plum needs a job fast before she runs out of money and ends up getting evicted from her apartment. She askes her cousin Vinny if she can get the vacant secretary job at his business only to be told the position was just filled! Not to be discouraged Stephanie blackmails cousin Vinny into giving her one of his bounty hunting jobs. She could hardly pass up the chance to drag ex-boyfriend Joe Morelli to jail and earn $10,000 in the process! Unfortunately for Stephanie, Joe is a ex-cop who skipped bail on a murder charge and is not eager to be jailed before he can prove his innocence.The story was pretty fun. Stephanie was a likeable character and it was entertaining to follow her as she learned how to be a bounty hunter. She and Joe had good chemistry and their crazy exchanges were hilarious. The mystery of who set up Joe gave the plot an extra dimension as did the inclusion of the menacing and crazy stalker Stephanie picked up in the form of local celebrity boxer Benito Ramirez.On a random note I thought it was pretty interesting to read a book set in the mid 1990s. It is easy to forget there was a day when mobile phones and the internet did not exist for 99% of people.I'm looking forward to the next book in the series!Rating: 3.5 stars.Audio Note: C. J. Critt did a great job with the audio version. My only issue was that she sounded a bit old for 30 year old Stephanie, but ultimately that was a minor issue.
