A Bend in the Road is about the intersecting lives of Miles Ryan, one of the town's deputies who's lost his wife in a hit and run accident about two years and is now raising his only son Jonah, and Jonah's teacher and recently divorcee Sarah Andrews. Obviously they fall in love, and obstacles, this would be where the 'bend' in the road occurs, fall in their way in this tale of forgiveness and romance.*gag*Right, so I was recommended this book by my co-worker who I made read the Hunger Games, and wanted to see what I'd think of a book she really liked.Well.So the book isn't absolutely terrible. The romance is overthetop cheesy, the writing makes me die, and I just didn't care throughout the whole thing. But there were moments where I was entranced, and I liked the book to some degree. I won't be reading anything else by Sparks, probably, but hey it was fun.For entertainment purposes only, here are two things that I noticed were a bit abundant throughout the novel:A. Everyone smells everyone's hair. Especially Jonah's. SURPRISINGLY they all smell like SHAMPOO. Who'd thunk it? Also, that's kind of weird, shampoo shouldn't be that strong, I think anyway.B. EVERY. SINGLE. PERSON. IN. THIS. DAMN. BOOK. RUNS. THEIR. FINGERS. THROUGH. THEIR. HAIR. Seriously! Miles is the worst at it, I can't count the number of times he 'runs his fingers through his hair' and it fluffed up or something like that. I started imagining him with an afro just to get through those parts.I know characters have ticks, bitting their nails, etc... but, and my creative writing prof has told me this SO MANY TIMES, there's a limit. Please. Please. PLEASEFORTHELOVEOFGOD. Don't go over it.So the story by itself isn't too shabby a piece of work. It pretty much follows the usual romance formula of getting together, evil story element involving past breaking them apart, and then forgiveness, etc... There's a good amount of mystery, and while it's pretty much predictable, it keeps the story flowing. The one thing that did bother me about the plot (and this has to do with the romance as well) is the fact it wasn't a harlequin novel.I know, I usually rant about things that are too harlequin standard plot, but I felt there was a definite lack of a certain event that usual occurs in a harlequin.Yes, people, I'm talking about the sex scene.Maybe I should be a bit more specific. Yes, there was a sex scene in this novel, just like there was a sex scene in Breaking Dawn. Both of them sadly play that fade to black thing, and well..it kinda sucks. Cuz you know sex scenes are kinda fun to read, and also the reason why I read adult romances. :P Ha.No, but seriously having that fade to black thing was a bit of a letdown for me. The whole romance in particular was actually kind of a letdown, not only because it was kind of cheesy and had lots of mushy stuff and more of that OMGSOHOT moments, but because the author kind of paints their relationship sort of saint like.The best example of this is that they pretty much tell each other they love each other before they ever kiss.Seriously? I think I've read more riskay stuff in YA novels. I'm an adult, I'm pretty sure I can handle a little lust. Please don't belittle me by making a romance seem so perfect. Relationships aren't like that, because people aren't like that, so don't take the time to make this a I'VE FOUND MY SOUL MATE, NOW WE CAN LIVE FOREVER AND EVER TWILIGHT STYLE. It isn't real. And I don't like it.The writing, as I've mentioned, is perhaps in addition to the romance one of the worst things about this book. So most of the book is written in 3rd person and changes between characters, which isn't bad. At best it's decent, as they're nothing really special about it, and most of it is riddled with cliches. But it works, and keeps the story going, so I can't really condemn it. While I didn't care for the writing, I have to admit that it wasn't the 3rd person that drove me nuts, but the 1st person infrequent chapters told from the point of view of the hit and runner.*Sigh* This is going to sound very very mean, but the 1st person writing really was some of the worst I'd ever read. I think I wrote better stuff when I was 13 or so. I don't know what it was, I can't pinpoint what I felt was wrong with it, but it was just awkward, and urk. I can't explain it, but as soon as I started to read it, I wanted to run away from the book as fast as I could. Odd, I know, but an utter turn off for me.All in all, A Bend in the Road isn't a bad book. There's a good enough plot, and plenty to entertain. It's not, however, a great, or even possibly a good book. The romance is just lame, the writing is barely decent, and it makes me wonder why and how Sparks makes a living off this stuff. Then, again, A Shore Thing was a NY Bestseller, so go figure. 1.5-2/5
