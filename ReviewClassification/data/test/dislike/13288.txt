I'll probably be dead by morning for daring to write this about one of Green's books but boy did I loathe this book... 1,5 stars just because I enjoyed the first 40 pages and because I can't help loving John Green.Okay if this book was like 500 pages long I would have quit. Fortunately, it was a short read. This is the second time I've read Green and I cannot say I was impressed with this one. I'm sure I'll take pleasure in reading the rest of his books though(I was lucky enough to readThe Fault in Our Starswhich is one of my favourites). I had been warned that this was not a tantamount to the Fault in our Stars but I didn't see this coming.Even though the book is based on a good premise (nerd prodigy gets dumped by no less than 19 Katherines), there is absolutely no plot and I was unable to identify with any of the characters. I didn't like Colin (which was a real shock for me- being a nerd fan, having been a nerd myself, quoting Sheldon Coopen 24/7). He is too annoying and too self-centered for my likes. Also the ending is so predictable I wanted to kill myself once I got to the final chapter. I found the footnotes extremely distracting and utterly absurd and I hated the Math thing. Really John? Math??? Formulas? I often do the same mistake. I come across a book I like, I fall in love with the author and then I just go on to read other books by the same author. Big mistake, but I never learn. I've already purchased Looking For Alaska and I can't wait to start reading it(See? I never learn). Hopefully this one will live up to my expectations and I'll get the chance to see some of Green's great sense of humor and wit again.If you plan to read John Green I wouldn't recommend this book. To my mind, this felt like a waste of time. It certainly didn't make me a better person nor made me laugh. And it most certainly didn't help me overcome my Math phobia.
