Unpopular opinion time!I came so incredibly close to DNF-ing this. A bunch of my friends gave lovely reviews to this book but I sawRachelhad given it a one star and I was immediately apprehensive. We tend to have similar taste, especially with fantasy (and wedding dresses) or whatever the hell this was so I should have known better.I have never been so bored with a fantasy novel. I kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. Yes, we get that Gwyneth is is special and she has powers that her jealous and sort of horrible cousin was supposed to inherit but that's it. There's no danger here. There's nothing going on besides running around in the past in period appropriate clothes trying to catch the right timing. It's all a bit silly.Then there's this whole secret society thing where everybody in the world knows about time traveling but nobody knows what they actually do with these powers. I'm sorry, but people would be trying to infiltrate that shit and kill people off. There would be legitimate danger at some point. But besides one assassination attempt, they just frolic around in their corsets and top hats and ride in carriages.Also, Gwyneth makes a horror/action movie mistake when she tells her best friend everything about what is going on in this super secret society. I mean, come on. You are asking the girl to get killed, kidnapped, or something. Nothing ever good comes out of something like that, especially when ONE OF YOUR FUCKING TEACHERS IS IN THE SECRET SOCIETY.The love interest, Gideon, was rather stupid and shallow. Super judgmental and flip flops very quickly about what girl he likes. Does he like Charlotte? Only if she's a special snowflake which she isn't. As soon as Gwyneth is special, Gideon likes her. There's insta-love and a male lead that ended up irritating the hell out of me. He acts like he is top shit but gets over powered and out maneuvered on several occasions.So here it is.The Big Finish! The Rude Conclusion!Main female lead that is too stupid to live. Would have slapped her given the opportunity. Nothing actually happened throughout the book. Male lead is an idiot and shallow as hell too.
