anyone that employs the phrase "a bird the color of feces" in their writing should be, for evermore, prohibited from publishing anything. i once heard someone say that dave eggers is the most important writer of his generation, and, thus, lingeringly, i tasted said bird. as atrociously destitute as his works are, and oh god make it stop, his dedication to 826 is quite commendable, andnearlyoffsets the damage he's effected by writing books in the first place.see also kerouac, jackon the road
