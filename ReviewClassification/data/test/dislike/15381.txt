BIGGGGGG DNFHoly effing hell, people.Or should. I say. Holy. Effing. Helldiver.All I can say is...Seriously though, I was expecting some uber Sci-Fi awesomeness here and I feel like I got shafted with some broke ass YA that took itself waaaaaaay too seriously without having any actual sincerity.There is NO way I could have been reading the same book as everyone else.That's gotta be it.My local library must have accidentally supplied me with the staccato-speak, melodramatic version of this thing instead of the real one......although I had a sneaking suspicion this book and I were not meant to be when I cracked this bad boy open and saw these two nuggets of brilliance in the dedication/acknowledgement sections:"To Father, who taught me to walk."...or trying to be "ironic."Followed by this little ditty:"And to the reader, thank you. You're going to bloodydamn love these books."Well...actually...Because I most definitely did not.Not only was the story boring as FUCK to me, but the cocky egotism displayed in the "acknowledgements" was clearly evident in the writing.Every single sentence felt so pretentious that I could only imagine Brown typing each sentence out and then hitting that period button while exclaiming...Ugh.Regardless, this was just not what I expecting in any way.So I'm not going to torture myself by finishing and then giving what I know would be a heinously unfair review.
