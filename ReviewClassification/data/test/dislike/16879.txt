so the Sarah Dessen Reread Extravaganza continued and this particular installment may not have gone super well but you know what? you simply cannot win them all.this was just veryyyyy dramatic to me and the characters were boring and floated in and out of existence and there were just So Many Quasi Profound themes and ahhh!! also it was very long.the progression of time also could NOT HAVE BEEN MESSIER IT WAS DRIVING ME UP A WALL. hard to create a neat linear timeline, I guess, when you have to interrupt yourself every other paragraph in order to soliloquize on the Meaning Of Family and the Importance Of Optimism and blah blah blah.too saccharine for me.bottom line: not my favorite but the SDRE (Sarah Dessen Reread Extravaganza, obviously) will continue!!
