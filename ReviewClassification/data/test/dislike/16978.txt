After a very long time, I read a crime-suspense novel. It didn't meet my expectations. I think the plot is over-streched and taking an eleven year old boy as a smart hero who got all his talent by watching movies seems somewhat unbelievable. The author could take a teenager on his place. The end of the novel makes you fool asking the question, "why did I waste so much time?"
