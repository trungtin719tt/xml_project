This book is crap. Jack Kerouac and Allen Ginsberg should have left it on the crusty, filth-laden floor of Burrough's apartment where they found it. If you want to read a book written by a guy on enough drugs to kill a stallion, please, by all means, subject your brain to hell. Otherwise, read "Junky," at least it has a plot. Sort of.
