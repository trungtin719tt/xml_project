Okay, a few people has asked me why I only gave 1 cheap star to this book that seems to be a favorite of so many. So, I decided to explain how I feel towards this book with the following points.But first, I am sorry in advance if I offend a fan of this series. I know it hurts when someone talks crap about a book you love and I know this book has tones of fans but SORRY!So here I go!1. I got almost halfway through the book. I read like 45% of it and I couldn't keep reading. So yes, I didnt' finish it. It's not that is a bad book, or that the writing sucked (my own writing actually sucks big time so I never judge about that aspect) but I think is pretty much a big copy of Vampire Academy.I know, WOW! big heavy words, but if you read Vampire Academy then you'll immediately notice the striking similarities between both books. And by striking similarities I mean general plot, characters, species, romance,even dialogues! I remember Aiden told something about the daggers to Alex (Aiden is training Alex under pretty much the same circumstances as Dimitri is training Rose) something like "you haven't earned the right to use one of those" (He said this when Alex wanted to grab one of the dagger) Well, something very similar happened in Vampire Academy) and the similarities continue and are endless! (and notice that I didn't even finished the book. I just got halfway through it and that was enough for me to feel like I was reading a complete Vampire Academy rip-off. Hopefully thing changed by the end of the book and things turned out to be Armentrout's own ideas (I really hoped that). However, I have been talking with a few friends and it happens that, according to them, that's not the case. (that is the opinion from people who did finish the book, just so you know)2. I feel like the author tried to re-write Vampire Academy on her own way (but not really, she just changed the names and places) and then oops! it happened she sold it and got published. I still wonder, how that even happened? O_o?? I knew there were similarities between VA and this book but... aren't they too many? hmmmmmm...3. I cannot like a book I felt uncomfortable reading and for respect to Richelle Mead, I coudln't keep turning this book's pages without feeling like crap for her. And that's why I willingly stopped reading this book. Thanks LORD I didnt buy it but borrowed it from a friend! if not, I would have burned it already.I totally understand when books (or whatever) have similarities. That's totally fine. Originality is impossible and everything comes from something else. That's what sources and inspiration are for. But well... this is not the case.There you have it my dear fellow readers. You may actually enjoy this book if you have never read Vampire Academy. Otherwise, it may feel repetitive, predictable and even offensive! (it was in my case)
