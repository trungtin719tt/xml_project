*I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Thank you to the publisher and author for this opportunity.Let me start by saying this is not a light read by any means. The events that take place within the book are intense and emotionally crippling for any human being. The author pours out her heart into these words and speaks not only about finding healing after dealing with years of abuse, but the long and difficult process that accompanies that healing. Her story is not for the faint of heart and can be hard to read, especially for those who have also suffered similar abuse.My two star rating is due to the fact that this biography/memoir was at times difficult for me to connect with. There wasn't really much of a story line that lead into any of the events. Rather, these things just happened. For me this book read more like a list of facts (or events) that took place, and less like the story of a woman who has survived and is using her voice to share her experience. There is no room in the story for the reader to get emotionally invested, not in the people she mentions, or the horrifying situations she has survived. There is mostly just time that passes and then another event, and for me that just doesn't flow well, or allow me the opportunity to get to know the person(s) I'm reading about.But regardless of HOW the book was written, I will say this: I can only imagine the courage it takes to share such a personal story with the world, and I have so much respect for the author for doing so. I hope that this book can inspire courage and strength in other victims of abuse and that Aimee's story be a beacon of hope to those who read it.
