I'm pretty disappointed with this book. The last one was pretty good but this one... not so great. They kept using this stupid pretty language that annoyed me to no end. If i hear that anything is "Bogus, bubbly, pretty-making, fashion-missing" ect. EVER again, i might have to strangle that person.Besides the annoying slang, the main character is now a complete twit. She is a "Pretty" sure, but she made some really stupid decisions. The worst was at the end. She picked the WRONG guy. and that's all i'm going to say on that subject.There's also the fact that Scott kept comparing her to a princess in a tower. Well, not even princesses are that dim. She completely left her old friends for some guy who didnt even really like her. He only liked the fact that she was rebellious. So, for this guy she leaves her BEST friend Peris, her TRUE love, David, and turns her back on her only REAL friend Shay. For what?Not a good book. I'm not even sure i want to read the next.
