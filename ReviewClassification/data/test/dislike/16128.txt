I'd give this a 2.5* rating because the whole time I was reading it the one thing that kept popping into my mind in order to describe this was weird. It's a really weird, dark and somewhat depressing book (not quite what I expected). I did enjoy the writing, it was written much like a stream of consciousness and that was interesting to see, but there were times that phrases were repeated and I wasn't really interested in reading the same thing 3 times or more in one novel.This is the story about Tender Branson, a young boy who grew up as part of the Creedish religion. In his town everyone is like him, he is trained every day to one day leave his home and go out into the big, scary world and work every day of his life. He's trained that this is normal, only the firstborn son gets to stay in the village, not him. And so this is exactly what happens, but as we read more we see that that's not all that happened, beneath the surface there's actually a lot more that happened to Tender, and we discover it slowly as he recalls his life story whilst hurtling towards the ground in a hijacked aeroplane.Straight away this is a very weird narrative and the page numbers are back to front in the book too which makes it an interesting twist. I did enjoy this twist, starting a story from the end, but it is somewhat depressing and loses some of the excitement of guessing what could happen.Tender I thought was a fairly normal guy considering that he'd been in a Cult. He thoughts fairly similarly to how we would consider things and he didn't like the monotony of his life, much as you or I may not. I found that his character was convincing, but certainly was not a character who felt too emotionally scarred as I would have expected.The story was a bit on the mad side with all sorts of crazy things going on leading up to the major ending that we already know is coming. I think it would have been a better book had we not been told this from the get go, but I can also see that his life is rather insane and he's a bit insane and that telling the story from end to beginning may relate somewhat to that.Overall it wasn't a bad book but it also wasn't a great one, it was just ok. I don't know if I'll pick up more of Palahniuk's work or not, I thought it was a good book in places and a crazy or dull one in others. I wouldn't recommend it, but if you like contemporary stuff maybe you'd enjoy it more than I did so overall 2.5*s sums it up pretty well I'd say.
