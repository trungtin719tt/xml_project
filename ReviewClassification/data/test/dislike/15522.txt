The best thing I can say about this book is that it has a lot of Eric in it. Otherwise I think it's possibly the worst of the series.Charlaine Harris has a slow, rambling style of writing, which I happen to enjoy in a nice, fat 800-page novel. When you're publishing 300 pages of widely-spaced type in a large font, you need to be more focused in your storytelling.This book seems like half a novel. There are several plot lines left hanging, and the ending is rushed, as if Harris saw her deadline approaching and decided to have somebody beat the living crap out of Sookie (yet again, with feeling this time) so that she can be rescued and the book can end.I used to really appreciate the small-town Southern flavor of this series, but the author is laying it on too thick now. And while Sookie has never been the brightest bulb in the box, she comes across as positively stupid in this book. Her internal dialogue is really annoying.It doesn't help that the plot revolves around Sookie's fae relations, and the fae are my least favorite paranormal characters. In fact, I'm beginning to despise them. They detract from every series where I've seen them included; they're too powerful and too other-worldly for urban fantasy.One last petty complaint: the author's name and the title of the book are printed at the bottom of every page, and that got on my nerves after a while.
