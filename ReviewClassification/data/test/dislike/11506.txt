So I slogged through all 6000 some-odd pages of this and I truly hate myself because I actually want to read the next one when (if?) it comes out. I think the next story she set up is more interesting.I guess I understand the appeal of these books. She tells a "ripping yarn" even though it takes her waaaaaaaaaaay too long to get there. Her characters are memorable. She has interesting details (albeit far too many of them.)Far from great writing, but it's a good page turner and I must say I had fun laughing at the supposedly erotic passages, and her obsession with people's asses.
