1.5 starsHere's a compilation of my live Snapchat updates.Some jumbled thoughts:I don't care about any of the characters that I'm supposed to care about anymore. The longer you spend with SJM's characters, the more it seems like she's completely incapable of keeping character's consistent or giving them realistic development. Not caring about these characters has a significant impact on one's ability to enjoy this book, as so much of it hinges on characters and their relationships with one another.The plot in this was a staggering and derivative mess, on the whole. We spend a lot of time watching people with more knowledge than our protagonist trying to tell her what she needs to do, and her promptly telling them SORRY Y'ALL, I HAVE MORE IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO. The sense of what is and isn't a priority in this book is astounding. Of this ~700 page book, I would say the vast majority doesn't contribute to the plot. Most of it is romance and sexual tension because clearly all of the characters need to be in relationships or working on it, right?? Of the bits of plot we get, it feels like a mix of a Harry Potter rip off and a copy of her own book,A Court of Mist and Fury. The ending of this book is pretty much the same as ACOMAF.The writing in this is lazy af. I honestly wish SJM wasn't contracted to release two books a year because it'sobviousshe could afford more time to polish these books. We have an unwieldy amount of POV characters in this, and even with "distinct" POVs, we bounce between different character's thoughts instead of focusing on who we're meant to be focused on in each scene. If you're going to have multiple POVs with a focus on their individual thoughts, you can't randomly go omniscient as you see fit. You can't have omniscientandlimited POVs. Pick one.(Also, even if we have an unwieldy amount of POVs... it's a little fucked up that one of the main characters isn't in this book. Astounding that you can just cut someone out like that.)Once again, as with ACOMAF, I'm struck by how GODDAMN HETEROSEXUAL THIS BOOK IS. Every character is in a pairing of some sort, and so much of this book is characters thinking about how hot their love interest is... and a lot of times the attraction comes down to proximity. These two characters of the opposite sex are spending time together? Clearly they're eventually gonna wanna fuck each other if they spend enough time together. The majority of this book seems to be trying to build romantic and/or sexual tension between characters... some of which feels really off. We have characters that say things that make them sound like they may be asexual drooling over a bead of sweat rolling down a dude's ~oily and hairy chest~. We have characters who are straight up misandrists with a love ofwomenhooking up with men. SJM hints that maybe there are characters in her ensemble cast that aren't straight, and then reminds us that ALL FEMALES GOTTA HAVE THE D - it's a rule of life, don't you know?I will say that the LGBT+ rep in this is better than her previous books, but that doesn't mean it's good representation. I could do a whole video on queer characters in this book. I might. We'll see.I don't know, man. This book was boring for the most part. I have 18 minutes of footage of me ranting to Snapchat because I had to stop every few pages to rant about this book. It's not good, and I'm now convinced that this series has no hopes of redemption. I was willing to give SJM a chance after the mess that was QOS, but this was no better.
