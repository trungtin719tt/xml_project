what in the wattpad hell did i just fcking readthis is aCALL OUTto everyone that loves these books. because i know what you are. you're just horny. because there was umno plotto this book and it astonishes me that this was published.this lovely book picks up right where the last one left off. jewel is with wingnut jr. and she is continuing to fall for him. what a surprise. she decides she wants to see if any of her pals are alive (since we didn't get to see the fcking battle that was built up to in book 2) after the battle. wow they're alive what a fcking shocker. everyone kumbayas except for adumb duh, because let's demonize the cast off love interest. and of course everyone else sees the light, joins forces with gem stone &amp; wise cracker, andthey all defeat evil together.i seriously made that plot sound workable. it wasn't. but that wasn't even my biggest issue with the book.i was annoyed af with the love interest situation. as i've said many times,triangles are my favorite shape.but ms. mafi had to ruin that for me. in all fcking aspects.--------------------------------first we have wakadoodle "hell's empty and the devil is in my pants" warner.besides his problematic past i was willing to open myself up to loving him. we like a redeemable main character but he turned out to be not so likable. let me count the ways and regale you with some quotes:- he gas lights the FUCK out of jeweltone and makes himself someone to feel sorry for, ex:"because i do not have the luxury of philosophizing over scruples when i'm forced to act on basic instinct every day""don't ask me questions you already know the answers to. twice i've laid myself bare for you and all it's gotten me was a bullet wound a broken heart"- he stole her journal that she wrote in at a vulnerable time in her life and quoted it back to her. she didn't like this:"you think you know me just because you've read my journal- you stupid, prying, privacy-stealing asshole"in short:regardless of whether he ate mad pussy near the end of this book, he's kind of a fucking psychopath. i don't care if his murders were justified. he is emotionally damaged from his upbringing and needs some seriously therapy before he enters into any sort of relationship. oh yeah and stop stalking women, thank you.--------------------------------then we have the lovely adam:i'll keep this short. but turning adam into an asshole was probably the cheapest move on the part of this author. it would have been so much more satisfying for adam to idk tragically fall on a knife, or accept that jellyjam has a new man or just be really sad idk. but to make him hateable was such a cop out. how an author handles the choice at the end of a love triangle really says a lot about their writing. and making adam into some incel asshole was just cheap. unsurprising, but cheap.BUT CHANDLER YOU GAVE THIS TRASH 2 STARS WHAT GIVES?????1. gem of ice actually grew as a character. she stopped sniveling, i didn't see any crossed out words, it was a nice change of pace. that alone really made it bearable to read. i think she was out there wilin a little bit with her "i'm the savior of this dictatorship" but whatever. the plot was trash, i knew it, but at least she was trying to do something about it.2. the blue balls did evaporate and we did get some fucking. which was necessary given the lead up.in summary: this was not enjoyable to me. the best part was when juliet was drawn a bath. if you want to read about people fucking go read some smut/romance/chick lit because at least that has a plot.*****************loins on fire; a buddy read withsabrien&amp;kayla
