Seriously, Fitzpatrick?!Seriously?!I just.....I just can't understand! First Adornetto, then Kate, and now you not only once with your freaking graphic novel, buttwice?!See, you're even makingDean(my dearest Mocha's husband) cry. This madness has to end!All of the authors I've mentioned so far are not doing this to advance the story, in any way, shape, or form. Hell, all of these series could have been done in half the amount that there are currently; all of these authors are doing it for one reason only: the money. I understand that the life of an author is a hard one, but whatever happened to the damn story?!It just sad. Writing books should never be about just the money; it should be about making an impact on society, actually furthering your story arc, something, anything but swindling people out of their hard-earned cash on a book that really should never have been published. But that's the world we live in today, isn't it? Authors that actually have good, original, stories and put their heart and soul into their writing are turned down just because of today's pop culture; those millions of little idiotic girls screaming for the next Edward and Bella. I don't think I've ever been more unhappy to see a book published than Twilight; honestly, it changed the whole dynamic for YA and that's basically all we've gotten since then. Shit-tons of TSTL girls, overly protective-and in some ways downright abusive- guys, with plots as slow as molasses, horrible research skills, and characters/ story arcs that authors just add in or throw out for the hell of it.I'm sick. Sick and tired of it. This is what I feel like doing to all of those authors right about now:Oh, and some of this:Edit:So.....she's calling this book asaga?!Sigh.....I don't even have the energy to be mad about that, after my brutal smack-down, so, please, let me direct you all to my dearest friend Anila's review that describes my pain over all of thisperfectly.
