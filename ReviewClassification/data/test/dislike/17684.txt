Blue Moon is one of those books that I can't just enjoy the "journey" of reading the whole story but I just want to get to the end to see what happens. It was frustrating and I wanted to skip over the middle. To be honest I could have and not missed out on much. I'm not sure why I continue to put myself through the torture of reading these books. I have many complaints about this story.First, Damen seems like the typical guy who just wants to get into the girl's pants. All the while he continues to say, "I don't want to pressure you...blah, blah, blah." She obviously isn't ready to have sex because she backs off at the last moment every time. But yet she is made to feel guilty because she has "known" him for 400 years (though she has no recollection of this); a guilt that I can't help believe that he's responsible for. For example when he gave her a look of doubt when she told him "I just need more time" and she had to explain herself that she doesn't remember the last 400 years. It reminded me of that the typical guy who says, "But I love you. Don't you love me". I found it despicable that his next move after this conversation was to get a hotel room!!! He then got upset with her that she wasn't immediately excited. Was I the only one thinking, "What the hell? What a jerk!"? This is one male protagonist that I can honestly say I find to be unappealing. He is not the chivalrous, "Renaissance" man that Noel tries to depict. I had a hard time believing in their "love" for each other. I realize that they have 400 years of history, but honestly Ever doesn't remember ANY of it except for the last few months (or is it weeks-however it's been since they finally reunited). Yea, yea I know she felt something was familiar with him but still Noel fails to make me believe or see the deep-rooted love they supposedly have for each other.My second issue is the lack of developed characters. When reading Blue Moon, it seems that Ever is the only character, the rest just making cameo appearances, and the result is a very hollow, shallow book. I don't feel invested into the characters and thus I don't care what happens to them. I don't feel anything for the other characters except annoyance and I just wish that they would get killed off (especially Haven).Another issue I take with Blue Moon, well actually the whole series in general, is the lack of realistic situations. Sabine's reactions to Ever's odd and "destructive" behavior are unbelievable. There's something obviously going on with Ever but Sabine never seems to delve in any deeper than the surface of things. How about the issue that Roman is out for revenge and is so devasted that Drina was murdered BUT is still willing to hook up with Ever? I didn't understand why this man that was so compelled for revenge that he went through an elobarate plan to repay Drina's killer that he gives her a proposition at the end that he's a forgiving guy and if she ever needs some "company" to look him up? What the hell was that all about?Despite all of these issues and what I deem to be obvious holes and flaws in the storyline, Noel somehow still creates enough fascination for me to continue to read this series. I still want to know what will happen and how things will work out for Ever and Damen. The problems just seem to get bigger and bigger and less reversable. The plot is undeniably amazing and I just hope that she developes these characters more in the sequels to come. I also hope that the next three books aren't centralized on their desire and inability to have sex.
