Hear ye, hear ye: I am SUCH a liar, you guys! I've always admitted to having read the whole B.E.E. collection, but have lied. This one makes it... done. Complete! I am very VERY much done with Ellis at this point in my life. &amp; it couldn't have been sooner.The one striking thing about this one is its description of the fall of the once-mythical, once-impressive B.E.E.: once famous and rich &amp; relevant, he grabs at past glories in a very saddening fashion, grabbing at straws really, trying to relive/transplant various episodes of his once victorious and literary career. Esp. borrows heavily from American Psycho.This is very lame. I've been curious of where to place this book on the bookshelf... Top Shelf? (Rules of Attraction (#1), American Psycho (#2), Glamorama (#3))... Mid-Level? (Less Than Zero [#4])...OR(!!!) the trash, alongside other dried turds such as The Informers (#5) &amp; the most horrible of all, Imperial Bedrooms.That's right. You may probably guess.
