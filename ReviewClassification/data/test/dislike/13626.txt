This odd book is less a novel and more a 500+ page short story, with full page illustrations that make up half the book. These illustrations supposedly tell part of the narrative, but the majority of the information is told in the text, turning what could have been an interesting hybrid of text/illustrated story/graphic novel into a bastard combination that doesn't quite work.The story is quite simple and not very enjoyable. Perhaps because I haven't read "young adult" books in a long time, perhaps because I was already familiar with automatons and such so there was little new material to get me interested, and what was there was very shallow. Or perhaps because I know a lot about comic books and how "telling stories by words and pictures" is supposed to work and can see a lot of flaws.It is a shame, since obviously Brian Selznick put a lot of effort into this book, but it is, to me, a failed experiment.
