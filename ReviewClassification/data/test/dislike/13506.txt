Beware of spoilers!You'd think that after my dreadful experience ofShatter Mewould keep me away from the second book of this series. But no. The cover caught my eye. I wanted to see what otheroverdone, laughable, simply nonsensicalmetaphors and similes she had. And this review will do nothing to please those who loved this book.There was only one reason I decided to read this book.WarnerI mentioned in the last review that he had some potential. Yes, he was cheesy and demented in the first book, but I wanted to see how he evolved. Because to be honest, he seemed like the type of character that Mafi would put extra special thought into. He seemed a bit interesting and I knew he would evolve in some way. I knew Juliette was going to stay the same. The girl whose body parts would dangle from impossible places. The girl who couldn't take a proper compliment from another person. Whiny, clueless, extremely gullible. It's safe to say I pretty much loathe her existence.Warner is complex. He has a quiet, lethal, hard, military-like attitude. But he is also a different person with Juliette. He has his inner struggles and his hatred for his father. I felt like the whole book should have been about Warner. He would have been a little more interesting than Juliette's constant whining and weakness.I do want Juliette to end up withno one because she's honestly so insipidWarner. I mean, chapter 62.On the other hand, I won't talk much about Mafi's writing. Because we all know from my review ofShatter Methat I found her style of writing absolutely laughable. If my high school creative writing teacher were to readMy fists are full of unlucky pennies and my heart is a jukebox demanding a few nickles and my head is flipping quarters heads or tails heads or tails heads or tails heads or tailsshe'd question her existence on earth.Writing heads or tails once is just as effective as writing it three times.However, the writing wasn't as dreadful as it was in the first installment and because of Warner's interesting characterization, I would give this book a 2 out of 5 stars. I mean, I tried! I tried to see if Juliette would evolve. Or if even Adam or Kenji might surprise me. Oh, well...
