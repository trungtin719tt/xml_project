'Reservoir Dogs' and 'Pulp Fiction' are two of my favorite films. So in 1996, when 'From Dusk Til Dawn' was released, I was in line on opening night. For the first hour, I watched what was undoubtedly the finest work Tarantino had produced to date, and I eagerly anticipated a typically dramatic conclusion... but something went horribly wrong: FDTD degenerated into a B-grade vampire flick. For ten horrific minutes, I tried to convince myself that one of the characters had fallen asleep, been knocked out, ANYTHING which would allow the on-screen action to be dismissed as temporary, someone else's nightmare, a prelude to the rest of the film rather than What The Film Had Become.'Lunar Park' reminded me of 'From Dusk Til Dawn', except the pleasant prelude didn't last quite as long. The first chapter was brilliant, as Ellis, whose main character is a fictional creation named -- wait for it -- Bret Easton Ellis -- pokes a goodly amount of fun at himself, his career and the state of his life.Then the book falls horribly flat... before getting worse. This is a creepy cocktail of heavy drinking, excessive drugs, doped up children, and creepy hauntings. Ellis' writing itself is as good as ever, but thematically, he's a mess. For those who loved some or all of 'Less Than Zero', 'The Rules of Attraction', and 'American Psycho', but were disappointed by 'The Informers' and 'Glamorama', this book represents a continuation of trend. He covers a lot of interesting bases, but runs them out of order. As such, this book represents the third strike for Ellis.One caveat: on your next visit to your local book store or library, hang around and read the first chapter: it's a brilliant satiric synopsis of Ellis' entire career. Sharply written and bitingly acerbic, it's a must-read for any Ellis fan. Just don't read the rest of it, and certainly don't pay for it.
