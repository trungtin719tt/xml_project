Well this is just the same old tired format for paranormal YA boarding school romps. I've seen the same story time and time again in books likeSecret Lives,Evernight,Firespell, and it is just boring me.1)misfit teen sent to boarding school2)she doesn't want to be there3)gets on wrong side of popular bitches on day one4)instant crush on sexiest guy at school5)her only friend is a fellow misfit6)grim teachers7)obnoxious students8)murderer on the looseThe characters are either obnoxious muppets or cardboard cut-outs that have no depth or interest to them. The teachers don't seem to give a damn about discipline-explain to me why the werewolf who attacked Sophie on her first minute on campus got no punishment? Is attempted murder seen as acceptable at this school? The only one who was given a stern talking to was the guy who saved Sophie by using magic to protect her from the werewolf! Strange moral code from the head teacher don't you think? As usual in these books, the kids do what the hell they like with the teachers ignoring them, which defeats the whole purpose of the school in my opinion. These kids are sent to this school because they can't control their power so surely they should be watched closely!!! I hate stupid plots like this.*sigh* I think it's time to give up on these cloned books and pick up a proper urban fantasy book with a decent story and characters that don't bug me to death.
