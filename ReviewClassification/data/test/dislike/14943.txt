At this point, the novelty of little Southen Sookie is starting to wear thin. Harris has clearly established that "any woman worth her salt" does sensible things, is tough, doesn't put up with anyone's crap, and can clean a mean house. Thank you, 1952!But I think if one looks deeper into the story (assuming this is even possible), the entire series can be viewed as an allegory for women's liberation. In book 1 Sookie starts out as a piece of eye candy. The Bon Temps natives either want to bed her or are terrified of her. Sometimes both. But as Sookie comes in contact with more and more supernatural beings she no longer views her telepathy as a "disability" but is instead begins to use it. This is similar to women discovering that their sexuality is not a curse and beginning to use it to their advantage (i.e. take control of it instead of letting it control them).Perhaps the supe's themselves, and their effect on Sookie, can be compared to the development of the Birth Control Pill, which is often credited with giving women control over their bodies but also leading to more promiscuity. Sookie certainly had more freedom and pleasure once she was "freed" from inadvertent mind reading by the blank minds of the vampires, but she also faced many difficulties and battles (literally!).All this said, perhaps this reader's taken entirely too many literature and social psychology classes. Perhaps this book is just a bit of literary cotton-candy.
