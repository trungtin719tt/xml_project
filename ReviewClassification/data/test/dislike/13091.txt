I haven't yet read the third, but I'm kind of hoping Patch has already drowned Nora in the ocean at this point (otherwise the cover has lied to me).In that case, since this does not yet have a title, this book should be called 'Sunk'. You know, after Nora's ass.UPDATE 27/4/12So the summary is out."Nora is more certain than ever that she is in love with Patch. Fallen angel or no, he is the one for her. Her heritage and destiny may mean that they will always be enemies, but there is no turning her back on him. But now they face their biggest challenge. Can their love survive a seemingly insurmountable divide. And in the end, will there be enough trust left to rebuild what has been broken? The lines are drawn - but which sides are they on?"So in other words, Fitzpatrick, you're still out of ideas. Just masturbating to the same old abuse/glorified rape/glorified creep-and-general-disgusting-assface fantasy over and over again, and this book is the aftermath of such. Yep, yep, yep. Oooookay.So Nora is gushing over Patch pretty much the same way she's always been gushing over him. And Patch is the one for her, fallen angel or not. Yep, conveniently skipping over the rapist-in-the-making aspects as usual. Big challenge, stuff happens, we all know how it's gonna end, no one cares, the end. I still demand that everyone dies, and I still demand that Patch just lives up to this image on Silence and fucking sinks Nora's ass in the ocean. I am disappointed that, alas, it did not get called 'Sunk'.UPDATE 11/7/12The cover is out, and it clearly depicts Nora about to jump off a cliff.Nora is about to jump off a cliff.NoraabouttofuckingJUMPOFFACLIFF.
