I had a long review and I got too many responses to it. Comments and emails, and strangers connecting with me because of this review.So I deleted it.Here is what I will say nowI once gave this 5 stars. I have since changed it to 2 stars.My focus is on something else now. This book is fine but I don't recommend it any more but other books instead...If you are looking for control over yourself and future, Its in being as close to God as possible.How to do that and what that looks like is a much longer explanation and individual for everyone.Good luck on your journey!
