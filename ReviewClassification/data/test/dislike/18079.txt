What went wrong the first time:1) The plot was very different than what i had on mind. This just threw me off. For some reason, i expected CK to be about Grisha rising &amp; the crows helping out Nina to win the war. I wanted it to be grander than just Kaz and his greed. I was waiting for Ravka to rebel.2) The hype! Too much hype is a huge turn off for me. Always.3) Got spoiled about the ending &amp; apparently i wasn't the only one. Some fangirl didn't like the way Leigh wrapped things up, so she decided to protect us (SoC fans) from the cruel faith that was waiting for us. She spoiled many readers on purpose just to save us "the heartache and the betrayal". Bitch, what?!This time i'm going in with an open mind. Work your magic, Kaz Brekker. Let's see what you've got.
