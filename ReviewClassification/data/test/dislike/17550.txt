I liked it, wasn't a favorite but the whole Neferet/Kalona thing is getting old old old!Find a new storyline/tragedy already. We're into what, the 8th book? and we're still dealing with the same crap with Neferet? Gimme a new baddie besides the White Bull, he's still just an off shoot of Neferet.For a bunch of century old Vamps on the council, they're pretty stupid---I'm not seeing the wisdom here. It's time to let the Neferet/Kalona drag itself out and bring in a new storyline with the same cast, sans Neferet and Kalona!There's got to be more mischief for the fledglings then those two.
