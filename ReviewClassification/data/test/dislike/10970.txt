I think the world has forgotten this guy exists. (Sorry, Paolini... I hope you got yourself an editor, though. Or is this latest one still 700 pages long?)What's Shur'tugal mean, anyway? I don't remember... well,anythingfrom the previous tales. Except for a bunch of elves... and dragon-hearts... and it's all gone fuzzy from there.Hmm. What say Knopf is taking so long to release this because Paolini is actually trying to make thisgood?Naaaah.So, anyone want to lend me a copy? Then again, I could use some spare kindling around my house.
