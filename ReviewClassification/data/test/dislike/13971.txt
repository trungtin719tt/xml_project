It's been a long time since I read the first book in this series (Halfway to the Grave), but I remember enjoying it quite a bit. Half-vamp heritage aside, Cat was an average Ohio girl. She wanted to be badass, but didn't know how to manage it -- so while Bones taught her to kill &amp; embrace her strengths, they fell in love. It felt natural. It made me smile.This book didn't make me smile. This book made me want to kick Cat in the face.I should mention that I'm biased against Mega-Alpha Females in paranormal books. I really hate when authors use a foul mouth &amp; asskicking as the embodiments of feminine strength. There's got to be more. A heroine can make mistakes. She can get her ass handed to her. She can pick herself up without lashing out at her boss, her teammates, &amp; anyone with a kind word.Just because she's backed into a corner doesn't mean she's got to screech &amp; claw.Showing delicate emotions outside her interaction with the love interest doesn't make her weak.But for whatever reason, Ms Frost completely abandoned Cat's vulnerabilities -- the things inHalfwaythat made her imperfect &amp; different from the usual badass paranormal neo-noir heroine. We don't get to see anything of Cat's growing into her new job. Instead we're tossed headfirst into Cat's uber-perfect badassery FOUR YEARS after the close of Book 1. Apparently she doesn't make mistakes anymore. She's Superman. She's Batman. She's Professor X, Wolverine, Rogue, &amp; Magneto all rolled into one...and she's got a team of ultimate badasses to follow her orders, guard the car, &amp; clean up after her one-woman wrecking crew routine. Lovely. It seems Cat's only weakness is her separation from Bones. When she's not beating people senseless or drinking gin from the bottle, she's mooning over Bones -- or rather, her lack thereof. But one day, a mysteriously appearing Best Girlfriend invites him to a wedding. Oh noes! Romance returns to her empty love life!Of course there are fight scenes sprinkled throughout, but they felt unconnected -- token violence to earn the Paranormal label. There's also something vaguely sinister in the background, a plot that revolves around a mystery person contracting hits on Cat's life. Oh, wait...they already know who's behind it, thanks to Bones doing all the work off-screen. Then there's the mystery about Cat's familial relationship with her boss. Oh, wait...they hash that out in one long conversation, thanks to Bones' informants. Then there's the sad sobbing mess of trodden-upon Tate, Cat's second in command who's desperately in love with her. Oh, wait...both Cat &amp; Bones explain repeatedly that she'll never be with Tate, so tough luck. Then there's the tension about Bones' many previous lovers. Oh, wait...Cat fights with one &amp; earns grudging respect (of course), bookended by infodump conversations that are supposed to build character but instead offer brief respites between Cat's wanting to jump Bones. Then there's Sarah clutching her head &amp; wishing for any sort of sustained tension in this novel that isn't solved by Excedrin &amp; chocolate. Oh, wait...:PSeriously, the plot of this novel is loose &amp; lacking. Everything is solved without a hitch. All the plans come to fruition as they should; all the necessary emotional steps are mounted after one (or more) soul-bearing conversations that would make Jung proud. It's much more of a romance than an action story -- Cat &amp; Bones have lots of sex, &amp; not all of it fades to black. While I thought their love scenes in Book 1 were sexy &amp; sweet, these were just...bland. It's one mind-blowing orgasm after another, &amp; the dreaded Buttsex chapter was trying too hard to be kinky while wrapped in a vanilla-romance.In summary: you know a book is irksome when the cliched Latino sidekick's predictible innuendo serves as your sanity yardstick.This had been on my TBR for years, but now it's going in my Paperback Swap box. What a disappointment. :( I still like Bones (even with his unfortunate Austin Powers brit-speak) &amp; Spade (wish he'd had more than three speaking lines), so I'll plow through #3. But my hopes are effectively dashed. If I hadn't bought #3 when I bought #2, I wouldn't be bothering. Sigh.
