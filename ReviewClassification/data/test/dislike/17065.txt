It was okay. Maybe 2 1/2 stars if I want to be nice. It wasn't Mercy Thompson, that's for sure. The suspense was never really there for me since I knew already, from the Mercy series, that Bran and Charles would be alive in the end.Anna was rescued by Charles (a tall, handsome, half- American Indian). He saved her from a brutalizing Alpha wolf in Chicago, who had kept her captive for 3 years. Injured, but in love, he brings Anna to Montana to be his mate. After arriving in Montana, it is discovered that there is a crazy werewolf out causing trouble in the woods. Bran, the local Alpha, sends his injured son Charles to solve the case. Of course, he brings along his peace giving (Omega) sweetie, Anna. There was a stronger romance vibe to this book, than in the Mercy books. The plot seemed more contrived. 1. Make it clear that Anna and Charles are soul mates. Cue love scene. 2. Have the lovers trudge through the snow in pursuit of the rogue wolf who is killing people in the wildernees of Montana. 3. Make the Alpha (Charles) wolf vulnerable and soft by keeping him injured, from delayed healing of silver bullet injuries, for the entire book. 3. Have a nasty, black witch, who is seemingly unstoppable appear out of nowhere. And, wa ha ha, cackle, cackle, discover that she is behind the rogue wolf in her attempt to find Asil, another ancient wolf with a secret past. It was just like a dance: 1, 2, 3, kill the witch, marry and be happy. What did I like best? There was a preview of the next Mercy Thompson book, due in 2009, at the end of this one.
