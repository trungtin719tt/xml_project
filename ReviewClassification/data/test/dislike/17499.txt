Fair warning, this book is intense. I would not recommend someone younger than eighteen years of age to give this a read unless they do so with a parent. This book was crushing and harsh in both good ways and bad. This real-life story of a woman who was constantly abused and mistreated will open the eyes of readers to the way the real world behaves more times than not. The message in this book about strong faith and trust in God, despite going through horrific trauma, will astonish you in ways not thought possible. I admire this author for being so candid in giving us her life story. I hope readers walk away from this book with both a compassion and more of an understanding of what many young women and girls possibly face on a daily basis.
