ALL I WANTED was a psychological thriller with submarines and Cold War shenanigans. (Why? Uhhhh, an insomnia-driven session of reading every Wikipedia article on nuclear submarine accidents I MAKE MY OWN FUN, OKAY?) And there was just enough of that here to keep me going, but it was buried in a mush of tedious exposition about military hardware, and an actual scene extolling the virtues of Apple, and it was fine, I know that's a successful genre and all, but it was soooooooooooooooooooooo boring.
