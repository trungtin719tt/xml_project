It's amazing how good the movie is considering this source material. It seems to me the movie only resembles about 40 percent of the book--Forrest is an idiot from Alabama who has a lifelong friendship with a girl named Jenny and he is unintentionally funny and finding himself in misadventures. Plus, there is a Lt. Dan.But beyond that, the movie is quite different. The biggest difference? The movie has a lot more heart and depth. The tone of the book is, for the most part, just flat out silly and ridiculous with Forrest having just way too many misadventures that make you say, "Yeah, right." It's all supposedly in good fun, but it sort of wears thin after a while (probably about the time he and his orangutan friend go to outer space and then crash in New Guinea and spend 4 years raising cotton with some cannibals).Sure, I laughed at parts. But the movie also made me cry.Another big difference is the movie seems like it is a snapshot of America from the 1950s to the 1980s, where the book only touches on history for a few moments.Anyway, if you love the movie, the book is sort of fun to read to compare the two and to consider how a good Hollywood screenwriter can take a decent idea and really flesh it out into something spectacular. It's a rare thing when I read a book and watch its movie that I say the movie was way better, but this is one of those times.
