I was initially skeptical about starting up one of these "blockbuster" novels, but Beach Music's prologue was surprisingly well written and I found myself strangely captivated to read on. As a testament to the quality of that prologue, I waded through a couple hundred pages of overwrought and overweight storytelling just to find some closure on the Jack McCall's wife's suicide mystery. There would be times in my reading when I had to look away from the book because the prose would be so sentimental and contrived it was painful. For example, "At certain times in our lives, we crackled in the sheer electricity of our desire to be wonderful in bed...We set down feasts for each other and treated our loves with tongues of fire. Our bodies were fields of wonder to us." I don't want to meet the people who think this is an example of good writing.However, Pat Conroy manages to tie all of the dozens of back-stories and personal dramas that he had been casting out together again near the two-thirds mark in the book. At that point, he thankfully backs off from trying to be an impressive writer and just settles in to being a capable storyteller. The highlights of that story for me were George Fox telling Jack about his experience in the Holocaust, the episode of Jack and his three friends stranded at sea, and Lucy McCall's childhood. I cringed whenever Jack would banter with his three indistinguishable brothers and one schizophrenic brother, and the Jordan Elliott story line could never lift all the narrative weight it was expected to shoulder.I made it through all 768 pages not because I found Jack's healing process credible, not because I found the South Carolina backdrop endearing, not because I really cared why Shyla committed suicide, but because I was impressed by how Conroy brought all of the disparate parts of the story into a working whole. I won't read another Pat Conroy novel because there is too much good literature out there, but reading Beach Music was not a waste of my time.
