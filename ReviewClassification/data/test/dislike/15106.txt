I couldn't wait to finish this book... but for all the wrong reasons. Even a 2 star rating seems generous.Back in 2002, when this book first came out, it was probably fresh and exciting. But from then on a lot has evolved in UF/PNR-land and I think I've been 'spoiled' with good quality writing.The writing was extremely simplistic, repetitive and annoying. The POV changing wasn't done well at all. The story was (I know: even for a PNR about a 2000 year old Spartan demi God) totally unrealistic. The characters as well as their actions were unbelievable.Take for instance our heroine: Grace. Despite the fact that she was a successful sex therapist, she seemed to have little to no sexual knowledge (she kept talking about feelings she never knew that existed, both mentally and physically). She also kept bringing up personal and vulnerable topics with the hero while in the presence of others. Privacy anyone? Oh and the cherry on the cake was that this supposed sex therapist had her own untreated sexual trauma, a fact that makes you project your own problems on your patients and therefore makes you a bad therapist. The big trauma was that she was deflowered (at 24?) by some guy who didn't care for her. And 5 years later she was still all shaken up about it. Booo fucking hoo!Argh, this book had me rolling my eyes constantly. The dialogues and inner monologues at times seemed to be competing for the prize of 'cheesiest lines ever'. If it wasn't for my compulsion to finish stuff I startedandthe fact that I wanted to know what the Kenyon-fuss was about, I would have thrown the book out. No, maybe ritually burnt it.I'm told that the Dark Hunter series is good so I'm actually willing to spend money on the second book. I hope I won't be sorry...
