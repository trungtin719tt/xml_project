This is one of those books I can't give a star rating to--at least not by the definitions goodreads assigns. I did notlikethis bookat alland yet I am forced to admit it is powerful, important, scary-as-you-know-where and should be read by every parent of teenagers today.My daughter broughtCrankhome from the school library and also read it in a day; it's positively riveting. Ellen Hopkins first novel is based on her own tragic experience as a mother of a crank (meth) addict. So althoughCrankis technically a novel it's more correctly a fictionalized autobiography written from the perspective of the young teen, Kristina/Bree. She was born and lived as Kristina for 16 years. After her introduction to crank, or 'the monster' as she refers to it throughout the book, she discovers this wild, seductive, bad girl inside her named Bree.To add to the overall eerie effect, Hopkins writes the entire book in sculpted verse. Each page is a different shape, direction and interplay of italics and plain text. Although I'm familiar with other books which use this poetical technique, I've never seen it used to such creepy perfection. The flow of words, spacing and grouping seem to mimic the rhythm of the drug and how Bree feels it, or the booze, cigarettes, lack of sleep, or whatever event/emotion she is experiencing.Be prepared to stare into the Void.WARNING: The language in this book is as crude as would be expected given the pseudo-life drug addicts slip into.
