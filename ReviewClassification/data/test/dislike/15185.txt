I did *not* like this book. I found the main character to be completely unsympathetic and I could not relate to her or with her to save my life. I understand WHY she was a bitch at time to Dexterbut quite honestly, I didn't really care. I just couldn't really get into it. Especially towards the end, when she flipped out on Dexter over the whole picture incident. I wanted to rip out my hair, throw my book against a wall and throw her over a bridge all at the same time..ok, well maybe the last bit is going overboard but it. drove. me. CRAZY. And then her slutty friend (don't remember her name) told her not to even apologize to Dexter? Yeah, that enraged me. Also it was annoying and got old how she would always think to herself and wonder why she felt a pang in her chest or a tug in her heart when she was dating that retarted frat boy and then would run into Dexter. I felt like screaming BECAUSE YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM YOU DUMB ASS!!! I don't know the book, to me, was a hell of a lot more annoying than it was entertaining. I will say that the ending was perfect and I enjoyed it but..ugh..as a whole didn't really like it all that much.
