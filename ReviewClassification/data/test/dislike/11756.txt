I was disappointed with this one. I added it based on memory of the old 70's classic starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman and maybe for that reason my expectations were too high.There were a couple of intense parts to the story, so I will at least give this a 2, but overall, the story ran on, seeming to repeat itself with similar encounters. The translation may be to blame, but I thought the writing was amateurish. Henri Charriere was writing about his own encounter in escaping the French prisons, several times, but his telling felt like someone exaggerating the facts and bragging about their exploits.What I got out of this; yes, the conditions in this prison system were horrible, inhuman, but that doesn't excuse the fact that Papillon was a criminal and a murderer. Just because he managed multiple escapes, many by committing murder, does not make him a figure to be admired.
