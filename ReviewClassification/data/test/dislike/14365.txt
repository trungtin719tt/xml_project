You know, don't know what the fuss is about. Maybe it is me, maybe it was all the hype, but, I thought it Factotum was crap. For the record, I am no intellectual, I am not of the thinking it has to be hard to read to be good, but, for me, Factotum read like it was written by a 15 year old trying to imagine what a hard drinking womaniser would be like.There was no depth, flimsy characters that the author paints a vague suggestion of, bouncing form job to job - each is brief but lacking. The tale is of a guy 'Chinaski' who rolls from bar to bar. I guess how he seems to be able to walk into any bar, in any state in America and it is full of easy women who, for a drink will just give it away, just pissed me off. It was weak, lazy writing. This is why I don't get the love for this author. When you read, for example Palahniuk's description and detail of Marla Singer in Fight Club, even about Chloe, who was about to die, he puts you there with a richness and prose that complements the dark text.In contrast, Bukowski, for me, reads like a guy telling a joke. Most of the text 'fluff' to get to a punchline that never actually happens. Oh, and there isn't much plot, not that I have a problem with that usually. If you want an example of this style of writing and the beauty of plotless - Craig Wallwork delivers a 'benchmark' with The Sound of Loneliness.The book reads like a synopsis... just a looooong one.I wanted to love Bukowski. But it's just too weak for me.
