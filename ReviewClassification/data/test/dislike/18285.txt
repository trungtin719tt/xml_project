The very first book that I read in my teen years that was fantasy was "A Wrinkle in Time". I got hooked. So when I came across this book by Madeleine L'Engle I purchased it. I did not know that it is a quartet of her books that starts out with "A Wrinkle in Time" and carries the same characters through the next three stories. I'm excited to start this series. I hope that I won't be disappointed because what one likes in there youth may change in adulthood. So here goes...Well, I was disappointed. "A Wrinkle in Time" was ok but "A Wind in the Door" was horrendous. "A Swiftly Tilting Planet" just bounced from here to there and I was bored. The onlysaving gracewas "Many Waters". I like it and it saved the whole book. It was about the twins going back in time. It had a plot that was interesting and it left out all that metaphysics jargon.
