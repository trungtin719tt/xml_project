Granted, I went into this book annoyed with Cashore's anti-marriage, pro-casual-sex message in Graceling, but the book never got interesting enough to overcome those messages. Okay, I didn't finish it, but if 222 pages into it, I'm bored and nearly shaking with rage at Cashore for using a YA story as a thinly veiled piece of propaganda, I doubt the end of the book will redeem itself. This isn't even YA, it's adult high fantasy, but these days publishers market everything as YA, and so it's sold and read as YA where Cashore forces her stories around some unhealthy and harmful messages instead of letting her characters and story grow organically.This world full of monsters so beautiful people throw themselves at the monsters in lust and the monsters can control everyone's mind to make them do whatever they want was not a world I wanted to believe in. Plus, Fire is way too much like Katsa, but less interesting, more whiny, and the whole society more promiscuous. The book is congested with: friends with benefits (incidentally an 17-year-old with a guy several years older than her whom she doesn't even like and knows he's sleeping with every other girl in the country), a whole society sleeping around and fathering illegitimate children all over the place, lots of uncontrolled lust, people and animals throwing themselves atKatsaFire because she's on her period, rape (from all that uncontrolled lust), murder, that whole village plunder and destroy stuff, and the happy mention of her father saying that just becauseKatsaFire is beautiful he would never act out on that lust because he loves her, so throw a little incest into the mix. I don't know of a single, healthy relationship in the whole book, at least the part I got through. And the very worst of all of this is these things have nothing to do with the storyline.The story was so slow developing and the characters one-dimensional that never gained my sympathy. So I'm making up my own ending, which I've hidden under a spoiler tag since apparently it's pretty closer:(view spoiler)[that prince guy, Brigan, who hated Katsa, I mean Fire, with a passion and then all of sudden by the next meeting he's silently brooding over her, obviously in lust but she's too stupid to realize she lusts after him, yeah they're going to start sleeping together and then Fire can have a child without having a child and Cashore will justify why she absolutely cannot get married. But that would make Fire look cruel to dump Archer when he's openly sleeping with every other girl in the country so we're going to have to kill him off. This is wartime, we could do it there (although it'd be more likely that he dies from an STD), no, there's that whole unanswered question about king Leck in the prologue (the only good part of the story) so there's got to be a showdown with Fire and Leck and maybe all of Archer's testosterone can get him in trouble there. Yeah, that seems more predictable.(hide spoiler)]It doesn't really matter to me. The characters and story didn't grab my attention; it's the messages that did.
