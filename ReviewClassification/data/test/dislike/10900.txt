This review is really breaking my heart, and I've put a lot of thought into doing it. I decided that, while I of course stand by my earlier review (https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...), I want to urge you to recognize that that one was written by a much younger reader and that, keeping with the Goodreads grading, I finally felt forced to drop the Talisman down to a silly two.As you can already tell, I do not do this lightly, and I'll be sure to justify my decision...The main problem is that this book is way too long! I really love long books, when they captivate and draw you furter and further into the story, but really, this is for the most part just bloated! There is great writing, but there is just so much fluff!Another problem is that the protagonist is too young; this is of course a recurring theme in King's works and I only hope that subsequent re-reads will not prove this troublesome to me!(view spoiler)[ I put this in spoiler tags because, if someone did not have the picture in their head, I would hate to be the one to put it there, but; a twelve-year protagonist will, inevitably, look like Short Round doing karate kicks in the later stages of "Temple of doom" - fxxckin ridiculous!, i.e. it does not work - maturing to the task or not..."(hide spoiler)]Another thing; you have to love fantasy! You have to love it so much as to not ask some really relevant questions, such as magic working here but not there, the need for a quest at all and who makes that demand and a lot more. But there is of course beauty and that's why the young me loved it; bravery, character, love, unselfishness, beauty. All things fantasy - but this is not the book that makes you drop all inquisitions, unfortunately.Finally, the charachter of Wolf; I'm going to have to put this in(view spoiler)[I know lots of people loved this ambiguous character, I can't help but see Jar Jar Binks with large flapping ears most of the time: "Meesa Jar Jar! Wolf! Wolf!"(hide spoiler)]The Talisman is the 18th book of my Stephen King re-read and the first one to devastate me; I can only hope that the rest of the catalogue brings me so much, and more, joy that I expected.This one, I will honestly say: treasure your fond memories of and skip it in favor of many, many brilliant others!
