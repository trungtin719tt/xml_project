It's going to be really difficult for me to rate this, because I can't deny that I enjoyed it. It was, by definition, craptastic, or as my good friend Em likes to say, trashtastic. I mentionEm because I did this buddy read with her, and that made it all the more an enjoyable experience. She's as much a masochist as I am, and we find the same things ironically funny, so all in all, it was fun. Read her review, because her analysis is better than mine, as is her sense of humour.That said, in fairness, I cannot give this book more than 2 stars.Where do I start with this book? It is supposed to be an honest commentary about the usage of "dolls" - stimulants like barbiturates and amphetamines by women in the show business. And in its strange manner, it is. Perhaps the only thing this book achieves is that it manages be what it set out to be. It fails in its other aspects quite spectacularly. It isn't well-written in the least, the prose is repetitive, clunky, and boring, and the book is a hundred pages longer than it should have been. The book tries, in its own ways, to be empowering and feminist, and in this regard, it fails. The book also tries to be an accurate commentary of life in show biz, but in this aspect also, it fails. It fails at making me sympathise with the characters; in fact, it does the opposite. It alienates me from the characters.Anne was just a small town girl living in the lonely world who took the midnight train going to New York. Anne and her friends Neely and Jennifer are just three girls trying to make it in '40s New York. Anne, educated at Radcliffe, smart and the quintessential American girl, who starts off as a secretary, but becomes the face of a cosmetics line. Neely, fresh-faced and nervous, who by her talent rises to become one of Hollywood's greatest stars. Jennifer, gorgeous, defined by her beauty rather than by who she is as a person. Sounds interesting doesn't it? well, it was, until Susann decided to make caricatures of her characters. Neely is seventeen when she becomes a star, and of course, it gets to her head. She becomes tempestuous and moody. Signs of a genius, they call it, until it becomes too much for them. She becomes addicted to the dolls - to maintain her figure, to help her sleep, to help her stay sane. Her first marriage to the doting Mel fails because of her vanity and infidelity. Her second to Ted, because of his. Throughout the story, despite her childish behaviour, in spite of her tantrums, I never hated Neely. She came up through pure talent, and that was rare. She did stupid, ridiculous things. She had nervous breakdowns. I liked her through it all. Until. Until she performs her last act of ultimate betrayal. And thusly, she was made a caricature. A caricature of a talented Hollywood superstar whose personal life is in a complete shambles, who turns out to be a total stereotype. Susann doesn't know when to stop, and that seems to be this book's biggest problem. Susann takes perfectly good characters and makes you hate them with such seething passion, you begin to question your hatred of pretty much everything else. She had, in this book, an opportunity to step away from stereotypes and deliver something real, but she didn't, and somehow, I'm disappointed that she didn't.(view spoiler)[In a way, I was glad for Jennifer's untimely death because at least her story didn't get stretched to a point that made no sense.(hide spoiler)]Anne, sweet Anne whom I liked despite her pathetic and dogged devotion to Lyon who really didn't deserve it. Until, of course, the last two pages, because somehow Susann doesn't want me to like her book at all. I felt sorry for Jennifer because she was a genuinely good person who made some terrible choices. And on whose body and face more value was placed than on her as a person. Except by Anne, and maybe Henry. Henry was truly the only character I genuinely liked in this book, and dammit, he should've had more screen space. Susann takes issues like feminism, and to an extent, even addiction, and makes a mockery of them. Not directly, but because of the way she talks about these things. She seems like she's giving her women the power to fly, but she instead clips their wings by making them deeply flawed and superficial. Not that there's a problem with either, but it's like she's not even trying. In a way, it seems like she is shaming women for rejecting stability and the ideals of life for a woman by showing its dire consequences.The reason this book fails ultimately is because of its ending. Look, I'm not the kind of person who expects a sunshine and rainbows ending all the time. But after I invest hours reading some 400 pages of which half was unnecessary, the least you can do is give me a halfway decent ending. As Em said during our discussion, while this may have been revolutionary when it was released and sparked a lot of talk, this does not take away from its negatives.In the recent past, I've read two great books about the show business. One, a novel,The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo, and the other, Tina Fey's autobiographyBossypants. Both of them handle similar themes as this book, but do so with a much greater elegance. If you're looking for a good, enjoyable read on this subject, pick either of these two books. If you want have fun, however, pick upValley of the Dolls
