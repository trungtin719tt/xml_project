I am beyond dissapointed with this sequel. Uglies was intriguing, making it's society around our world's obsession with apperance. This book was just 350 pages of dull "action". I didn't even read most of the book: I just skimmed it so I could move onto Specials.Where did the strong Tally that had developed so well go?She turned into a brainless idiot, never to be seen for the majority of the book.And, worst of all, she's attached to her new boyfriend like glue.Yes, her new boyfriend.THUS, Westerfield inserts one of the most overused plot device: A LOVE TRIANGLE.Alas, the most milked, beaten-with-a-stick plot cycle is now in this book.David vs. ZaneThis paring is somewhat paced the same as Gale vs. Peeta (from THG): Those two are probably the best written love-triangle I've read, but the problem is, similar to David, Peeta got the whole first book for everyone to fall in love with him, so when Gale (like Zane) comes into the next book, no one bothers to think he has a chance.Only, unlike Gale, Zane is a flat, boring character. All I remember is he's hot and loves Tally. That's IT.Also, I AM TIRED OF BUBBLY AND BOGUS. I wanted to punch whatever character was using "slang" at the moment.So, needless to say, I'm less pumped to read Specials after this disaster of a book. I just hope to see some actual development of the plot.EDIT: A few things I need to add:1: The Hunger Games is most CERTAINLY not centered around a love triangle.2: This love triangle in Pretties is only similar to the pacing of THG's triangle. Only the triangle is the most prominent part of Pretties/Specials3: The ending of Specials was so. Predictable. It's. Not. Even. Funny.4: Again, I understand Hunger Games' triangle is barely even a part of it. But that's another discussion.
