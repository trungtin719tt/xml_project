Overall: disappointed. I wanted to like this book, as it had such an interesting futuristic concept, but it fell short in so many ways.First of all, I realize this book was written in 1931 and society as a whole was much different... however, Huxley, in my opinion, should have had the foresight when writing a futuristic novel to realize that black people would gain equal rights, and would not remain servants until the end of time. Science has progressed so far as to make test-tube babies, but social justice hasn't advanced -- at all?? Ok. Another problem I found was that Brave New World focused way too much on sexuality. Just about every chapter mentioned some people "having" each other, and it got stale real fast.There are sooo many aspects of futuristic life that Huxley could have focused on and explored in this groundbreaking novel, but he focused on the same few aspects throughout the novel, and kept mentioning them over and over, without any new information being added. (See, groups of twins, sexuality, conditioning). Don't get me wrong: these topics were interesting and though-provoking, but there are countless things that a novel of this size could have explored, but were simply ignored. Also, the ending sucked; predictable, lazy.Despite the shortcomings, the story was, for the most part, interesting, and I very much enjoyed the character of the Savage.I did not read Brave New World Revisited, as I didn't particularly enjoy BNW.Favorite quote:(view spoiler)["He would have liked to speak; but there were no words.
