Good lord in heaven! What in the name of Yves Saint Laurent was THAT?You know how cigarette packets come with those white panels on the front that say SMOKING KILLS and SMOKING SERIOUSLY HARMS YOU AND OTHERS AROUND YOU? This book should carry one of those labels. It would say, THIS BOOK IS REALLY GENERIC.It's not that it's bad. Well. Okay. Look, I'm trying to be diplomatic. This book was bad, but it's not the sort of thing that, if you're interested, you shouldn't read. There were some pretty cool scenes... Okay. One cool scene.(view spoiler)[The scene in the arena at the end. It was daringly gory and very deftly written. Oftentimes I find that fight scenes are written in such a way that the author knows what's going on, but nobody else does. Here, everything is pretty easy to visualize.(hide spoiler)](Safari keeps correcting my 's' to a 'z' and it's pissing me off.)But the problem is that this book is just a great big patchwork of a thousand other YA sci-fi dystopia melodramas that I really couldn't care less about. It's nothing special, the characters are nothing special, the plot is laughably simplistic. Even the twist was visible from a mile off, because of course that character that everyone has been side-eyeing for the last three hundred pages is evil. Of course the character that the heroine tries the hardest to convince herself is good people is bad people.But it's so cringey, like making small talk with the hairdresser. Here's this incredibly boring girl, Alina Starkov, who gets taken to the Capitol when her Grisha powers emerge in dire straits (!) to be initiated into the X-Men elite where Magneto's actual children are the stock Misogynistic Caricature Of A Popular Mean Girl(tm) and Snotty Popular Boy Who Is Equally Bad But Obviously Less Culpable Than His Sister(tm). Cersei Lannister engages Alina in a battle of wills(view spoiler)[and shit hits the fan when she orchestrates the killing of Robert Baratheon so Joffrey can take the throne even though it rightfully belongs to Mal. I'm not entirely sure if Cal is Mal (well, they got the names right) but he's that sort of jerk that you can tell the author likes but who left me colder than a chest freezer. He could have been spaghettified by a stellar black hole and crushed into unobservable matter in the singularity and I wouldn't have given a rat's ass either way.(hide spoiler)](view spoiler)[I don't know why it's made out that electricity can stop projectiles, or cannot penetrate through water. Water is a conductor, and if Evangeline is hurling metal at Mare's head, a wall of electricity isn't going to stop it. I guess you could say that if Evangeline's power is to create magnetic fields, then Mare's lightning interfered with that, but that's really clutching at straws and there's no evidence that simply applying a shock of current to a magnetic field will block it. In fact, hardly anything can block a magnetic field; it's a powerful force. Can Mare create forcefields? That's never really solidified.(hide spoiler)]Even the writing is lacklustre; it sort of does its job but that's it. Even theRise, red as the dawnthing that was clearly a marketing tool falls flat. I've said this before and I'll say it again: you can develop your protagonist until you're blue in the face, but a story is nothing without a supporting cast. World building is nothing without decent supporting characters. I knew this book and I would have a hard time getting along when I realized it was written in exhausting, unfunny "snarky" first person, but look at the world Suzanne Collins managed to built through the eyes of one character. You sell yourself short when you try to create a high fantasy/sci-fi/dystopian world through a first-person narrative, but it can be done.In terms of the world building, there is none. If world building were food, this book would be starving. There's this glassy castle and a smoky district and then the nasty Stilts, but it's so skimpy, guys. There's no depth to it at all. And this book tries to do the biopunk thing with the silver blood and the inherited powers but it's all just drugs and magnets, isn't it? The fact that anybody believes the ruse around Mare is proof that these people might be powerful, but there's nothing but cobwebs between their ears.Red Queenwas not a letdown for me, though. I didn't have high hopes to begin with, so I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. I suppose that's the best outcome from all of this: I gained and lost nothing. Aces!
