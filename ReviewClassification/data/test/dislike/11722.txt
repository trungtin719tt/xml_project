The Circle of LifeIn this book authorBarbara Kingsolverreally takes the liberty within this book to assert her views on the circle of life, nature, the land, plant, animal and human life existing in conjunction to each other. She rolls this philosophy up into the lives of three main characters who live two in a small town and one in the mountains above the town in the Appalachias. Deanna has been living as a forest services ranger for two years and studying the wild life peacefully before Eddie Bondo infiltrates her world. Lusa was a scientific lab technician teaching in Lexington before she met her husband Cole and moved back to his rural farm amidst his imposing family. Nannie is a spry senior citizen running her own apple orchard organically. Her neighbor old Sheldon Walker always has a bone to pick with her natural methods. He at first thinks her a witch. Everyone and everything is effected by nature from beginning to end.This was a bit of a difficult read for me. I actually had to push myself and I could have put it down quite a few times but I was curious. I have enjoyed two other books by this author but this would be on the bottom of the list of her books for me. It seemed to ramble on at times about the names of flowers, trees, plants, insects, moths, wolves, goats.. You name it the research was done this species explained at length. Don't get me wrong, I enjoy learning as I read, even fiction but this was brimming on overkill in my opinion and I began skimming a lot. It got slightly predictable, pointless and boring. It seems the reason for the stories was to have a place to build her theories too. I don't know what I thought this was going to be like but it definitely wasn't anything I expected.I find it hard to rate this. The knowledge and research should be worth some positive points but the stories were kind of weak and I was really bored the majority of the book. 2 1/2 stars. I may try other fiction by this author considering I did like two other books of hers and this is the first fail. I do recommend anyone who has read her other books or those interested to give it a try maybe you will like it.
