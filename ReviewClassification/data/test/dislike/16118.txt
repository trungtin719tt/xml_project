What started out as a promising read quickly spiraled into a flaming wreck, similar to the plane crash that we're guaranteed on the first page. Or is it the last page?The book and chapters are numbered in reverse order, as some kind of clever gimmick so that you open at the end of the story, and count down the pages until you finally reach the beginning. The concept is intriguing, and might work better if the story was structured around it(think: the film "Memento") but here, it feels pretentious.Survivor ultimately fails for me at the 50 yard line, when the story jumps the shark as Palahniuk transforms the already unsympathetic lead character from Tender Branson cult missionary into Tender Branson media messiah.The book itself felt hijacked by Palahniuk's socio-politcal statements. Admitadly, a deeply entrenched op/ed is to be expected from him, but his commentary on cults and religion loses all significance as the tale switches gears into attacking big pharma, corporate religion, and merchandising agents.It's almost as if Palahniuk can't decide what he wants to say, so he uses the scattershot approach to take a jab at everything, and thus lessens the impact of any *one* thing.Even more bothersome is where the story gets choked either failing to adequately explain the motivations of characters (like Fetility) or in unbelievable plot points like when Tender, now an (in)famous international star, drops off the grid with a simple change of hair color, yet manages to surround himself with religious/charity types (hiding out at the Ronald McDonald House) and no one recognizes him!The biggest drawback has to be the lack of character development for every person in the book. It appears as though no one learns anything on their journey as each character exits the plot the way they entered: Fertility has no remorse for her scam job, Tender is a spineless blank slate waiting for someone to tell him what to do.The one character that dares grow suffers a deus ex machina death. Adam, Tender's "evil" twin brother shows up out of the blue for the sole purpose of... being killed in a really ridiculous way? I get that it's supposed to be a joke, but I'm not laughing. In fact, I kept waiting for most of the end of the book to be a dream sequence, or a bad LSD trip to "the bridge at Owl Creek," that's how far from reality the reader is driven.Ultimately, Survivor left me asking myself why I bothered to read the book in the first place something I'll definately consider before approaching his next work.
