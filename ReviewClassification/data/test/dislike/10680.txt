went to dinner with the boss lady the other night. she went on and on about this wonderful book. it was truly life changing. and she was already seeing the positive results of applying principles from it in her business and personal life.she wasn't able to really articulate any ot those principles, so she just gave me a copy. went through it the next day.holy crap. my employer, the person that i am financially dependent on, is a fruitloop. am updating my resume now.
