I boughtOscar Waoas a birthday gift for my mother in October based on scores of sterling reviews. She read it, gave it a mild thumbs-up (probably just being nice) and handed it off to me. Now having read it, I'm pretty mortified I thought this book would be something she might like.The critical consensus seemed to be that Junot Diaz is a good writer, and he picked a good story to tell here in his first novel. But I found this book lacking on both counts. I found the writing lazy and unexpressive in many places. Granted, I have no Spanish-language background, so there were some important places in the novel where I couldn't get the total meaning of the sentences, but I thought Diaz's reliance on slang &amp; colloquialism arose more out of laziness than from the narrative voice, which was often sloppy. There are multiple narrators and they mostly talk in the same voice, with the same elements of short humor &amp; pithy street wisdom offered.The story was just as diappointing. There were efforts made at epic storytelling here - tackling the Trujillo dictatorship of the Dominican and its spiritual ramifications on the generations of the de Leon family. But when you boil this thing down, it's just the story of a loser teenager trying to get laid. And there aren't any characters who raise the level of discussion. Besides Oscar, his mother's trying to get laid, his sister's trying to get laid, and so it seems the essence of the Dominican character is about getting laid. Maybe it's honest, but it's not saying much about their culture relevance. It was hard for me to take away any large messages from this book when it operates from such a crude fundamental point.I give it two stars only because Diaz seems to have a knack for narrative - the plot is well-constructed, even if it is slight &amp; irrelevant - and there are a few characters who will remain in my mind.
