This is definitely one of the silliest books I ever read. That's precisely why I kept reading! Imagine, you are living in a post-apocalyptic world and you are on the south coast of Australia where the last remaining people on earth are living. You are scheduled to die within a couple of months, so then tell me, do you really care if your daffodils are coming up next spring or whether you should be faithfull to your wife, far away in the U.S., who surely is dead as everyone else is over there? Well, no, any rational being wouldn't. You would imagine the few remaining people are terrified for the toxic cloud coming their way but, no, everyone is behaving rationally and politely and go on doing their usual stuff as much as they can. The book was written in 1957 and the Apocalypse took place in 1963, so I should have some mercy on these people. But, oh, are they tedious! Even the proverbial bad girl turns into a good girl and thinks it is a splendid idea to learn how to type and stenograph with just an estimated lifespan of three months of living to do! She should have kept on knocking away those double whiskeys, in my opinion! Anyway, it was a hilarious book and I liked it because of the outrageous 50's sentiments. Perhaps I should pay some respect to Nevil Shute for writing what must be one of the first dystopian books in the popular sense. So there you go, cheers Nevil, you managed to write a very peculiar book.P.S. I later understood that this book terrified a lot of people, especially in the U.S. Remarkable, but I notice there is often a distinct dividing line between the U.S. and Europe in what is considered seriously scary.
