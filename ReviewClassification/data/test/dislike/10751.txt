Oh my god.I just can't do this right now the first four were so good but this installment is drowning me in angst. I'm drowning, literally. There's no reason for Mac to be acting this damn sad &amp; I despise reading from Dani's perspective...Maybe later... but also maybe not since I've heard awful things about the later books in this series. :(
