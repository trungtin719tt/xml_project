omg OMG! which one of you was it?!?!? which one of you snekay little emo kids managed to pull this off!?you know, wilcan's level 400 creative writing class? last semester of my senior year of college? we had the classroom in Times Hall that didn't get air conditioning! i passed out in the middle of class right before spring break? that one time, when the health center prescribed me the wrong medication for my bronchitis!!!! don't you remember!?well i do. don't think i didn't catch this. i've narrowed the potential culprits down to just half the class already, but it's going to be pretty hard from here, considering the INSANE amount of students who thought "stream of consciousness" was an adequate way to convey all emotions, character development, foreshadowing, suspense, and or basic plot, for the entirety of their novellas.it's ok though, i'm going to work this out. if i divide that class among groups, we've got our basic five.1. jocks/journalism majors who needed four writing credits to graduate2. the overweight harbingers of creative death via estrogen and bad romance "storylines" that WERE NOT HARLEM ROMANCES! (of course, dears)3. the emo kids (this gets slightly complicated because we have to have sub groups, there were so many.)3a. emo kids who were emo because they were too scared to be goths. wore a lot of black, and drew on themselves with magic marker. amusing only because our college was in a place where i rained... a lot.3b. emo kids who wore flannel. they are all writing the next great american novel, which just happens to be about themsevles.3c. emo poets. nuff said.4. the two boys from TV/R who wrote every short story requirement about a fart named Bob who aspired to be a folk singer. god bless you gentlemen, wherever you now are.5. the kids who just liked to write. (i'm not sure where to put lacy. quiet, shy little lacy, who seemed normal, until that writing assignment where we had to imagine a horrifying event through the eyes of a character we would never otherwise assume. lacy, who normally wrote touching vignettes about cute little old people, read aloud to the class a graphic, horrifying short story about a farmer girl who has wild sex with her brother until their father finds them and stabs her through the heart with a pitchfork. i still have nightmares)Now, I know it isn't the TV/Radio majors, because last time I heard from them one had been expelled for growing the largest Marijuana farm ever amongst pea plants in the bio-halls greenhouse. Jocks aren't motivated enough. And there's a lot of sexual frustration in "a heartbreaking work", so i didn't wanna rule out the harbingers of creative death, but lets be honest. not even they could make it through 400 pages of very very very little bodice ripping sex.so that leaves, of course, the emo kids. the MASTERS of self involved stream of conscious rambling that verges on mind numbing blather. which makes perfect sense. one day, the magic marker musta just imploded your mind, man, and you realized... shit, i'm neve gonna get my story published unless i tie up dave eggers in my basement and substitute my writing for his.and it was a good plot. you almost had me. there were little tidbits of emotion driven plot in which i found myself tempted to invest in the storyline. but there WAS NO STORYLINE, was there? the only interesting part was *sometimes* the characters, and they weren't even characters! oh the irony... it's a MEMOIR! dave eggers/you didn't have to think, you just described real people who were actually interesting! damn. it's brilliant.if only that secretary at the miami herald would slip up and give me dave berry's address. i too would be well on my way towards...towards...huh. i'll get back to you on that one.
