Excellent and funI just love the characters this author comes up with. Death is a great ANTHROPOMORPHIC PERSONIFICATION and Mort, the human he selects as his apprentice, is the perfect replacement. Sort of.Mort has a hard time filling in for Death when he needs a day off. At least he does once a girl gets involved. There is romance in this as well, sort of. Apparently, not completing the job Death is meant to do has some pretty serious consequences that even a cameo appearance by Rincewind may not solve.One of the things I like about this series is the variety of characters and stories. I am reading the books fairly close to the chronological sequence in which they were released, which seems to keep the writing fresh. Usually I can only read a couple of books by an author and I need a break that involves at least a change of author if not a genre switch. The stories vary so widely in this series, however, I find myself looking forward to more after each book.At some point I may need a break from this series, but that moment hasn't arrived yet. On to the next one.
