Every moment with this book felt like a waste of my time. I've seen it all before: the ugly duckling pining after the rich asshole who could be transformed into a better man if he only realized that the right woman was right there in front of him. This plot is so well trod that I feel like there are hundreds of better examples of it that I could have been reading. And here is the thing, I love these kinds of stories as the size of my romance shelf can attest. But I hated these characters so much that I couldn't root for them.And as to the ending, can I just say that I didn't like it the first time it happened inCity of Angles, and I still didn't like it when Nicholls ripped it off.
