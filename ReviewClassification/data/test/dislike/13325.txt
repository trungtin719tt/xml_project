1.5 starsIt's a very old axiom, but do you believe the end can justify the means? When there's no choice left?NO. No, I do not. Especially when the end, which in this case is the supposed resolution of 900+ pages' worth of suspense and mystery, ultimately ends up beingbullshit.There is no explanation foranythingand what little there is turns out to be the biggest fuckfest I have ever had the misfortune to read.The Maze Runner trilogy started off with so much potential. Yes, there were parts inThe Maze Runnerthat grated on me like a wayward blender, but I lapped it up and dove into the next installment, eager as a three-month-old puppy.The Scorch Trialsdisappointed me greatly, still I was like, "It's okay, it's cool! The third and final book will make up for it. Right, guys? Right? RIGHT?"A little background information before this review spirals out the football field of sanity: Thomas and the others have gotten out of the Scorch and back in Wicked's headquarters. They are then offered a chance to get their memories back in order to fully complete this experiment and extract a cure for the Flare.Now from what I remember of Thomas from the first book, he was Alice in a dystopian Wonderland. Curious and always asking questions: "Where are we?", "Why are they doing this?", "Just answer my questions, dammit!" Armed with this knowledge, you'd think that Thomas would be real eager to get his real memories back and figure out why his past self justified and conducted these trials in the first place, his relationship with Teresa, and who his mother is.In what I can only fathom as abullshit way to drag out intrigue and save time in creating a backstory, the authormakesThomasnotwant his memories back because Wicked is evil, wah, wah, wah, and we can't trust anything they say!In fact, we'll escape! yeah, that's what we'll do! Never mind that getting back your memories is the sole thing you've been hankering for since you woke up from the Box months ago. Never mind that by doing this, you could potentially help Wicked discover the cure and save millions of lives. Never mind that(view spoiler)[ your friend, Newt, has the Flare and if you could pull your head out of your selfish asshole for one second, you could save him.(hide spoiler)]Oh no, let's go on a road trip to savemeand get all that nasty, manipulative Wicked tech out of my brain, which incidentally, has never fully been explained. Let's make it all about me, me, me. Minho? Who the fuck's that?The ending is the most selfish, stupid decision I have encountered.Allegiantwas better than what happened if you can believe it.(view spoiler)[He hoped that whatever they were, they'd be isolated and safe while the rest of the world figured out how to deal with the Flare, cure and no cure. He knew the process would be long and hard and ugly, and he was one hundred per cent that he wanted no part of it.So as long as his Majesty Thomas is alright, the whole world can go fuck itself, am I right?I wouldn't be so furious with Thomas's decision if it wasn't soat odds with his personality.This is the same guy who risked his life by going out into the Maze at night to save two people he barely knew. Sure, he went through some shit because of Wicked, but this is thousands, millions of innocent lives we're talking about. Harry Potter wouldn't have stood by idly if he knew sacrificing himself would help. Actually, that's exactly what he did in the Deathly Hallows.Percy Jacksonwouldn't have allowed this to happen either. He'd grumble and grouse and add a smart-alecky remark, but he'd do something about it. He would waste valuable time reserved for mounting a barricade against gods in order to move unconscious passersby out the street and harm's way. That's what heroes do. And Thomas is most assuredly not one of them. I am ashamed to have compared him to those two in my review of The Maze Runner.And how the fuck is preserving two hundred Immunes supposed to rebuild humankind? Say that by some miracle no one stumbles across them in this popped-outta-nowhere greenland. But Paige basicallyset humanity back by hundreds of years.I recently watched a documentary that says thanks to specialization, humans are extremely codependent. It takes a team of at least a hundred people to create a computer mouse. You need someone to pipe the oil up, to turn the oil into workable plastic, to slice it into pieces, to create metal springs or whatever it is that makes the button click... Not one person on earth can make a computer completely from scratch. And as smart as Thomas and the others are, I doubt they know how to make one either. So all that knowledge is essentially lost. Way to think ahead.(hide spoiler)]And like I said, there is no proper explanation for the stuff that has been plaguing readers since day one. All that build-up with flashbacks of Thomas' mom and tantalizing hints of Thomas and Teresa's relationship and we end up with diddly-squat.Nothing is resolved, not even the love triangle.(view spoiler)[Teresa's dying is cheap. Thomas doesn't have to decide and stays the aw-shucks good guy.(hide spoiler)]To this day, I stilldon't understand know how shoving Variable after Variable before Thomas and Co. is supposed to find the cure.Wicked mentioned it's to study their brain patterns, as per to how they react in different situations. However, as I understand it, immunity is coded in DNA and our genetic makeup. Studying behavioral reactions is in the field of psychology or neuroscience, and has nothing to do with why you have blond hair. Wicked should have been extracting bone marrow or blood instead conducting the Hunger Games 2.0. The way I see it, the author only did the Lord of the Flies thing to generate action and excitement. Entertainment factor over proper research/common sense; not your best decision.Newt was the only thing tolerable about this book.He had a proper character arc, unlike poor Minho, who was shoved to the side and had nary an important scene.If only he'd had some impact on the ending.It sounds callous, but you took him out of the picture, the plot would still run exactly the same.(view spoiler)[Why give Thomas' close, personal friend the Flare, if not to make Thomas see what it does to people and he has to help find the cure?(hide spoiler)]He was only there to generate a few tears (none were shed) and make Thomas into the hero again (and not a single fuck was given about our resident special snowflake).On a slightly irrelevant and happier note, this is the first series in which I have written a review for every single installment.I haven't felt this proud since I got my first troll.
