The only two characters I liked here were Clay and Jeremy, so if I will continue with the series it will be purely for them.Otherwise, the plot was predictable. The sort of love triangle there just for the occasional drama(view spoiler)[cheating is never ok in my book, even if the MC loved Clay, she still cheated on her current partner multiple times with him and that didn't exactly endear her to me(hide spoiler)]. The world buidling wasn't anything special. The MC, Elena... At one point or other I felt for her and her past, but also disliked her most of the time.Also, this one was way too much PNR for my taste. I love UF books, but I have never encountered an adult PNR series I loved yet.Fever didn't do it for me either. I actually hated that series, and Barrons, completely. Not counting Hidden Legacy, which I loved, 'cause it read more like UF and because it's Ilona Andrews we're speaking of.Armstrong's Darkest Powers YA series is still the best of her works. Her other YA trilogy - Darkness Rising - is also a bit more interesting than this one so far. But I did like Bitten more than the confusion of a first book of her other adult UF, Omens.
