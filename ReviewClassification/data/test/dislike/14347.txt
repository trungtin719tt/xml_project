Review summed up in two words:OVERBLOWN &amp; UNDERWHELMING.In some more: this is a beautifully written, but utterly moronic story where the infinite fatuousness of the characters just makes you want to bang your head to the wall repeatedly.During the whole time I was struggling to finish the book I had this feeling of something being "off".The voice of the author &amp; the writing style was pretty seductive: they made me want to believe that it wasthe terrible clutches of blind, cruel, indomitable FATEthe characters were wriggling in helplessly, but at the same time I couldn't help realising that it was just an artistic way of disguising stupidity and trying to present it as "DRAMA".This was the second and last book for me from Kate Morton. Clearly we just don't hit it off.
