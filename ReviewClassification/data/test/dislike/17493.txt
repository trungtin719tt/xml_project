Book 1: 2.5*Book 2: 2.5*The dichotomy that is this series. On the one hand I want to know how it turns out. On the other I don't think I can do another book with senseless rants, non stop nostalgic pop culture references, stereotypes ad nauseam and a storyline that meanders aimlessly.The characters are all tough to like. Not because they have flaws but because they all have non sequitur inane ramblings that drive the reader to the brink of the craziness which drives the characters.I simply cannot continue this series. Maybe I'll read a summary just to find out but overall it's just a waste of time.
