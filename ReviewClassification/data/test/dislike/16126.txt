After reading Fight Club and Invisible Monsters I realize that Chuck writes the exact same narrator every single time. Ooooh I'm a crazy person that's anti-society look at these dumb rich people who don't understand how to function. Enough Chuck. Enough.There are absolutely no believable characters in this book. I get that it's a satire but there is not even a resemblance to realistic reactions or reality.It's like Chuck has never interacted with people before and his knowledge of the world is taken out of bad movies.Avoid this nonsense and don't waste your time.
