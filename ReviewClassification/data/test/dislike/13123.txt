This is an OK Murakami. My 8th and still counting. I will always admire his imagination, creativity and passion in writing. He will always be in my Top 10 Favorite Novelists list. But I am rating this as an OK book. Not my favorite Murakami. The reason? It just did not excite me.Since I became an voracious reader and that happened partly because of Goodreads, I only religiously watch two shows: news (whichever I catch upon coming back home at night) andAmerican Idol. ReadingHard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the Worldis like what one of the judges, Jennifer Lopez, commented to my favorite contestant,Pia Toscano(picture below) when she sang a Motown song a couple of weeks back.[image error]Singing:Checked.Showmanship:Checked.Connection to the Audience:Unchecked.Reading this book is like having a huge kitchen sink being thrown at you. It is full of mind boggling details about two worlds narrated alternately. Even-numbered chapters talk aboutHard-Boiled Wonderlandand odd-numbered ones talk aboutEnd of the World. There are so many characters (none of them named properly) and many conflicts that slowed down my understanding. It was good that I read this with a reading buddy and our pace was 2 chapters a day and we commented at the end of each day so that we were able to compare notes. It was good that she has stayed in Japan so she is familiar with its culture and she added spice to my reading. So, I thought I perfectly understood what this novel was all about and will not require a second reading for me. Unlike Elias Canetti'sAuto-da-Fethat I thought I did not understand completely (because I rated it with 3 stars while my close reading friends rated them 5 stars), there is no Murakami mystery here that I thought I still need to unlock so toying an idea of re-reading is... cute.Early this year, I read Jay Rubin's book on Murakami calledMusic and Words.It tells about Murakami and his passion in reading. Murakami is said to read around 250 novels a year and has been fascinated with Western literature, classic and contemporary. One of his main influences is Raymond Chandler, who is said to be the original hard-boiled writer. The End of the World narration here is similar to Franz Kafka'sThe Castleand the idea of a man being separated from his shadow can be found in Knut Hamsun's 1898 novel,Victoria.Like Pia, Murakami'sHardboiled Wonderland and the End of the Worldrates:Writing:Checked.Storytelling:Checked.Connection to Me:Unchecked.J Lo is always quick to add her usual sweetener when she sees that these adolescent contestants are about to cry:"But know that I love you, baby"I am still a Murakami fan.And after the Elton John night, with Pia Toscano singing another ballad,Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me, Pia is now leading in the Bloggers' American Idol Choice survey!Which means J Lo and I could be wrong. But we all are entitled to our own opinions, aren't we?Go Pia!
