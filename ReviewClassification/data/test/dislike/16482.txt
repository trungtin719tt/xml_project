Like Redwall. Minus the quality.Oh, dear me the Warriors series. To this day I am at a loss as to why I read so many of the books in this series. Did I think it was okay? Was there nothing better to read? Was it peer pressure as my sister was reading the books? Did I have some kind of fascination with the series? Is it maybe because I like cats? Did I enjoy how campy and cliched the books were? You can take your pick from the laundry list, I legitimately have no idea myself. Even while reading the books I didn't like them, so I'm confused as to why I read most of the original six, two or three of the second series, and ALL of the third series.If you know a genius, have him analyze that last paragraph. I'd be interested in knowing exactly what he thinks is the reason.The plot really isn't anything special. Warrior cats in the forest, house cat joins them, has trouble fitting in, rises in the ranks shockingly quickly, all the generic plot points are there. And when the series attempts to split from the path of the unoriginal, it gets arguably worse. Instead of battle scenes, and I have to admit that what few battle scenes there are are not that bad, we get politics. Uninspired, mind numbing, drawn-out, repetitive politics. Okay, the cats can't hunt on the land of other cats. We get it. War is always an issue. We get it. I'm surprised that, what with the rivalry between the cats, one group of cats hasn't just taken over the entire forest. Maybe it would be a blessing in disguise if one cat did, as we could at least get a more interesting "One guy vs. the system" story. And for that matter, how come one cat doesn't just manufacture wars between the cats and then swoop in when the groups are weakened enough to be easily taken over?Half of the time, the plot is insulting to our intelligence. The other half of the time, with one small plot point being the exception and that doesn't happen until the third series, the plot is so predictable it might as well be insulting to our intelligence. The characters are all uninspired and uninteresting, with one exception. (I'm looking at you, Scourge) And he's only "interesting" because he managed to kill a single cat about seven times with one attack. (Certain cats have nine lives, don't ask) I say give it a pass, and find better literature for you and your children.
