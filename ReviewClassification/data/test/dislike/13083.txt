You know what? This is a really amazing series. Everything about it is enticing and intense. I find myself pushing these books to the top of my "to read next" pile, and when I open them up to read at night, I can't seem to stop thinkingI'll just read for another half hour...So when I was checking out the Goodreads page forSilenceand under the "Books by Becca Fitzpatrick" thing, I sawFINALE(HUSH, HUSH #4)I think I probably started screaming my head off with joy.But when I click on the link, thinking everything's all cool beans and stuff, and what should appear? Images of a slightly hilarious looking cat (Yeah, I thought it was funny, kudos to you and whatever, but I disagree completely) animated screams and eye rolls (Yeah, I'm calling you OUT, Nicki Manaj) and other screen shots and clips of famous people being surprised.And it was approximately then when I wanted to cry.Gosh, some of you people can be cruel. No disrespect or anything (well, at least maybe a bit...) but what is wrong with you? I did spy a comment as I traveled down the list from a miss Lauren Cawdell-I honestly couldn't have agreed more with her. Like, really guys. BECCA FITZPATRICK CAN READ THESE COMMENTS.Haters, I honestly don't understand why you're here. Do you understand it? I don't. I really don't. And I have my reasons...1) If you have this huge issue with her writing, you wouldn't have continued after book 1 (It's calledHush, Hush,'case some of you people forgot)It happens all the time. A series doesn't hold your interest so you stop reading. It happens to me! I couldn't blame you if this book isn't for everyone because youCAN'T PLEASE EVERYONE.Hate to break it to you. But she's got more than enough people on board with this series, so that's VERY good (COUGH, COUGH New York Times Bestseller COUGH, COUGH2) Why the heck did you care enough to come here if you didn't think you'd like it before you read it? You know absolutely nothing about this book yet and you are all already hating it like its the next 9/11. You have no reason to hate it. You all just keep going on "WHY WRITE ANOTHER ONE?!" and what not (Most of it involves extremely colorful language) I guess there's like this whole cult of you people out there called the BOOK FOUR HATERS, cause I see you any where that says (#4) in the title. If you should be in that group of people, just don't click on that title and walk away.3) You probably read the last three books. I'm assuming most of you have, at least. So you had to have either been expecting a sequel or wanting one. There was a bit of a cliffhanger inSilencewith the wholeAll I had to do now was decide my opponentbusiness. And I could say a lot more, but that would be a spoiler. And if you weren't expecting a sequel, you probably want one. You'd want to hear more of Patch and Nora's story. (If you don't know who they are, you are in the wrong place and EXTREMELY LOST.)Because most likely after reading the third book, you are willing to read more!4)You've given absolutely no evidence as to why this book will suck. I'd bet my money it won't. You haven't gone and pointed out any real evidence thatFinalewon't be good. All you people have done is go and complain. You all whine about it. Are you getting to lazy to read 400 pages? 400 pages that are actuallyworthyour time. Like you all just hate that she's writing another, but you don't really say why. You're peeved they're calling it a saga?Egads, call the police! It's a CRIME!!!(that was sarcastic, for those who didn't catch my drift) You're upset she's stretching out the story? Well, as I had probably stated earlier and will state again,if you truly loved this series you'd be totally ecstatic with that!!!Some of you hate the title.YOU TRY TO COME UP WITH A BETTER ONE!!!I will take this time to point out some of the lovely things I spied as I scrolled down the comments page...A Rendition of THREW IT ON THE GROUND by the Lonely Island, set into a hate-form.This took some creativity.I was walkin' through the Chapters store.And a man walks up to me and hands me the latest "Hush Hush" book."New book, really awesome."Man, I'm not going to let you poison me.I THREW IT ON THE GROUND!You must think I'm a JOKE!I ain't gonna be part of this SYSTEM!Man, give that book to some other Mary Sue!...At my high school with my so-called friendShe hand me her book. Says its Hush Hush."Man, this ain't a book! This is a sad excuse!"I THREW IT ON THE GROUND!What, you think I'm stupid?I'm not a part of this SYSTEM!PATCH IS A RAPIST!DUH!...Some poser hands me Hush Hush at my birthday party."What do you want me to do with this, read it?"HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO THE GROUND!I THREW THE REST OF THE SERIES TOO!Welcome to the real worl poser!So many books, to throw on the ground.Like Hush HushCrescendoSilenceAnd even this one!...See? Creative. Hating the whole series, for reasons like "Patch is a rapist" and yet...you still continued to be here after this hate fest. Yeah, smart... You can read the rest later under the full comment, but you'll ave to find it yourself.A new award...???Congratulations, Fitzpatrick! You won the Troll Award...Dude. Trolls are cute, and Mrs. Fitzpatrick has something to be proud of. A fantastic series. And you prob. couldn't write a better one.Wow..."I seriously doubt I'm going to read this."...Why come here then, smart one?!The real reason why most of you are upset...Maybe."...idiotic girls screaming for the next Edward and Bella"Ah. So the truth comes out. Bringing it full circle to Twilight. Man, you people just can't stop hating these books.Well, you wanna know why people keep reading those sappy love stories?Because we are tired of asking "WHERE. IS. THE. LOVE?!" You people just have to try to kill people's creativity that they've expressed through their writing.That's right. You're all just killing that thing called imagination. (How many of you are remembering Spongebob doing that rainbow thing in that one episode?) Spongebob was created from imagination. As was Twilight. And Harry Potter. And Hush, Hush. So was your favorite TV show. And your favorite shirt. Anything you see today started in someone's head. So the next time you try to strangle the imagination that comes out of someone, just think how you'd feel if they did that to you. Writing is self expression, a way of unleashing things that you want to say.And, let me just remind you, this novel is fiction. So don't go too overboard with anything, haters. Don't let all this hate in you be created from a book. Just relax.Actually, I could go on forever about this. But, to be frank, my fingers are cramping and most of you don't care enough to read this far. You'll read the first paragraph, decide what side I'm on, and leave if you're not on my side. Well, thanks to those who are nice enough to hear me out.But now, I'd like to give this last little paragraph as a shout out to Mrs. Fitzpatrick. You're an amazing writer, I love your works, and I'm THRILLED that you're writing another book. Congratulations.I think I'm done...for now. Don't give me another reason to keep ranting, Haters.EDIT:ALRIGHT. COVER TIME.First of all. The girl looks like Kristen Stewart. This isn't hating: I personally think Kristen's beautiful. But I can't say that I really think she looks like what I envisioned Nora to look like. Oh well. I love her dress, though its not really my style, and I like the movement it shows. Very elegant and fitting for a finale.The scenery is certainly mysterious and pretty, definitely in the same spirit as the first three. Still has the same elements as the others: feathers, black and white with red accents, some sorta of light poking out of the clouds,Patch looks stiff. So, horribly posed that it's making my eyes roll back into my head. And his hair looks like Bruno Mars's. But they did keep with those famous black pants of his.Overall, the cover does seem like it belongs with the other three. All of them are dramatic and beautiful in their own way. However, this one certainly isn't my favorite--that title will always be Hush, Hush. Hush, Hush had dramatic and gorgeous elements, something that'll stay with you. I loved the red feathers on that one, Patch's angular pose, and those battered, molting wings.
