Finally I have finished this series (I have politely deleted the adjectives that I considered adding to describe "series"). And even though I only spent about two hours on this one, skipping entire pages and frequently entire chapters, part of me still thinks that it was an hour too long.If you are interested in this series, simply use the formula below and insert the suggested words into the blanks for each different book:1. Tally doesn't like or feels out of place being ____.2. Tally gets roped into being a mole to uncover _____.3. Tally betrays _____.4. Tally realizes she was really stupid and tries to fix it.5. Tally gets capture (usually) and gets turned into a _____.(For Uglies, insert ugly, The Smoke, David, and pretty. For Pretties, insert pretty, The Smoke, David and Zane, and special. For Specials, insert special, The New Smoke, everyone, and environmentalist.)It's a bit of an oversimplification, but not much. Uglies was pretty interesting, but it was all downhill from there.
