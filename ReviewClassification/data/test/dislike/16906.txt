Evernight, by Claudia Gray, pseudonym of Amy Vincent, starts out with an okay plot, but the choppy writing and barf-y love story make it seem like the worst Twilight rip off possible.The gothy setting combined with the suspicion and eerie-ness of the students are lost on the reader when they realize that the main character, somehow "failed to mention" the minor detail of BEING A VAMPIRE. Of course, this is merely an easy way for Miss Gray to reveal in the middle the detail that keeps the story moving, despite the fact that it's lazy to try to patch together a story that way.Claudia Gray does little justice to a plot with potential. She navigates her way through the story with all the deftness and skill of a drunk sea captain steering a flooded ship through a hurricane. And that makes for one huge disappointment.
