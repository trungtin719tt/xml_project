THIS BOOK WAS NOT MY CUP OF TEA.So yeah, I got a couple laughs in the beginning....nah i laughed like a bull and almost choked on my water-_-But really, I'm about a third of the way through and I honestly have no idea what's going on.NO IDEA.......NADAZILCHZEROBecause all there was in this book, was a love sick boy who just couldn't get his damn feelings in check.And for some damn reason, THIS MC ONLY DATES GIRLS WHO GO BY THE NAME, KATHERINE.-_-Uh......SAY WHAAAA?????!!!!Yeah, you could probably already tell by the title of this book.So of course, this book starts off with him breaking up with his girlfriend, Katherine. (whoa really, what a surprise!)AND THEN THIS IS WHERE IT GOES CRAZY.Colin decides to go on a road trip.WHY??! I HAVE NO F*CKING CLUE.**Readers, if ur at this point, and you can still understand what I'm talking about, congratulations. You have a brilliant mind.**And from here, it's endless pages of words, words and more words.Like...he plops his butt in a car, takes off, and we're somehow supposed to be entertained by this.HA. HA. HA.Hilarious. *internally screams*Enjoy readers.
