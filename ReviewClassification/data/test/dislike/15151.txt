Half a "what the hell happened ?" star !!!2016 Worst Read of the YearOriginal Review written October 3, 2016Update : October 25, 2016 (mini review of the film !!)A couple of days ago 4 single girls (well women in their forties and fifties), my bf (convinced him to join us and he agreed if I took him to Denny's afterwards) and myself went to see this film. This is the main reason I read the book as we had planned this outing for months and then I read the book just before the film came out.As you prolly already know I abhored the book so I was grotesquely curious about the film.First though I want to give the rating of my lovely galpals when I polled them afterwards over omelettes !!Gal One : Book 4 stars Film 3.5 starsGal Two: Book 4 stars Film 3 starsGal Three: Book 3 stars Film 4 starsGal Four: Book 3 stars Film 3 starsBF - refused to read the book Film 3 starsJaidee Book 0.5 star Film 1.5 stars (in comparison Gone Girl Book 2.5 stars Film 3 stars)The film was seriously lacking, terrible dialogue, fairly poor acting (with a few exceptions), mostly very dull when it was not ridiculous.What I liked - Emily Blunt gave a 3 star decent performanceThere was some really cool art and some beautiful brief cinematographySaving Grace: Officer Riley played by Allison Janney was awesome. She had the right amount of wit and chutzpah for the role. She shone in her brief moments. Plus I love the way she is aging...so beautiful in a natural and haggard way.Am I glad I saw it ? Yes...time with my good friends and holding hands with my BF is always nice.Am I glad I read the book? Hell No!!Original review September 26, 2016:This book makes Gone Girl look like a masterpiece !!!At six percent I was very pleasantly surprised.At eighty-seven percent I wanted to tear my hair out on the ludicrousness and ridiculousness of this book.Recipe for this disaster- you start with three of the most unlikable women (ever...i mean ever) and you stir slowly( one is a pathetic alcoholic, the other is narcissistic and the third is troubled) until they are mixed so thoroughly that you can't tell them apart except that you hate them all-you start with an excellent premise that goes nowhere and so you have all three women terribly dependent on the men in their lives except they all cheat on the men in their lives and they all hate each other which makes you hate them even more-oh all the women are liars, cheats and oh so bored with their pampered lives....oh lets blame this on trauma, hardships , grief....ya we can be assholes becuz we hurt so bad.....now not only do you hate them...you want to bitch slap them too....but oh no you cant do that because they do it to each other and plan each other's physical and psychological demise .....-just when you think it can't get any worse...yes you got it...let's blame it on a man....oh yes he is a sociopath and yes all three women love him...boo hoo hoo-do we know what motivates these women (of course we don't) just suspend your disbelief so far that you think you might be on Pluto !!!Sorry for the rant but this book is a bloody train wreck and how it won the awards and accolades it has is beyond me.I apologize Ms. Flynn...you don't seem nearly so bad any more.Not only should I not have not gotten on this stupid train but I should have ran away instead.Addendum: Here is a funny little Youtube compilation where my review has a little cameo role :Dhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kO7l_...Bloody Awful :(
