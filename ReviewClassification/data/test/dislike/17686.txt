I usually try to give a series a chance so even though I didn't have the greatest opinion of Evermore I read Blue Moon in the hopes that, maybe, the series just had a slow, simple start and would come into its own as the books went on.Nope.Blue Moon was disappointing at its best moments and absurd at its worst. Every mysterious aspect of the story did nothing to capture my imagination or interest - including the new mysterious guy who was responsible for Damen's new mysterious condition. Ever did what she does best - run around in circles while the readers wish she would do something to validate all the time they spent reading.The Immortals Series feels like it's trying very hard to be Twilight but it's just not bottling any of the lightning that made that series so memorable or such a success with certain readers. Ever is indecisive and without depth, the only interesting thing about Damen is he's immortal and attractive, and all the high school characters are unkind stereotypes, headcases and sociopaths. The author throws in a ton of New Age tidbits but does nothing to create a firm mythos to her story to make it feel unique or let her readers feel absorbed in the world she's creating. It seems like a lot of potentially good ideas and good characters going to waste.At least Noel stopped with all the product placement and brand names listed on every page.(view spoiler)[One thing that really irks me - how can there be "rogue immortals" if there's no definitive immortal society or ideology they're supposed to adhere to? To go "rogue" one must break away from a system or act in defiance of it - these immortals have no such thing since they all drift around, doing their own thing. Since only 4 have been introduced in the series so far these immortals aren't "going rogue", they're just jerks.Also, can I say how anti-climatic and just plain silly it is that Ever would choose to believe Roman - a person she has loathed and distrusted since the second he was introduced - over a pair of helpful spirits sent by her younger sister, Riley, to watch after her? I understand Noel needed some avenue to get to her third book and whatever happens next but she couldn't think of a way that was plausible or made her heroine seem like such a dope? That kind of laziness in story-telling doesn't encourage me to read on because I'll likely just get cheated out of any satisfying resolution again and again.(hide spoiler)]I won't tell anyone else how to spend their money or time but I'm finished with the immortals series and wouldn't recommend it to anybody.
