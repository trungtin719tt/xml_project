In addition to allowing 1/2 stars, Goodreads really needs an "abandoned book" shelf.I had to abandon ship on this one, I guess I'm too liberal/free thinking/whateveryoucallit to think that teacher's unions are bad, and if only poor black women could get abortions we'd be safer after dark.I didn't stick around for the rest.
