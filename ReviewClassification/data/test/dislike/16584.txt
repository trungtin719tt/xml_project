I think my favorite part of this book was the conjuring of fancy gowns for the Halloween ball. I'm a big fan of Project Runway and its fun to imagine creating your dress using magic. I'm getting started on Demonglass right away and I'm looking forward to reading more about what happens with these characters. Did not expect the turn of events towards the end of the book. I love surprises!
