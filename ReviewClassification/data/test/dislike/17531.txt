2 StarsReview:This wasn't my favorite in the series, so I'll keep this brief.Things I Liked:- I admittedly do not know much about the details of the history and mythology of Christianity, so I don't know how much this book actually aligns with that, but Anne Rice's take on things here with Heaven, Hell, Creationism, evolution, angels, and Satan was interesting in its own way. And I liked how this book combined Christianity and evolution.- This quote. Seriously, it just cracks me up."Armand envies you and spies on you far more than you might think.""I hear Armand and I see him and I ignore him," [Lestat] said.Things I Disliked:- I read these books because I like the vampires. Those are the characters I've come to know and love and be invested in. But this wasn't about them. I mean, maybe something from this book will come up in a future book or something, but this was about Memnoch and the creation of the earth and the evolution of Man. You could take the vampires out, replace Lestat with any random person, and this would be the same. The vampires were hardly in it- On a similar note, there was hardly a plot because the entire book was Lestat's victim telling his life story and then Memnoch telling his life story. And honestly, this whole life story thing is getting tiring. Almost every book in this series is full of characters literally explaining their life stories, but who actually does that???- Dora was weird in an unrealistic sort of way. Like, when Lestat came back and randomly decided to rip off her underwear and drink her period blood, without asking her permission, in front of both Armand and David, she just let him, like it was a totally normal thing. And I'm not even sure that was the weirdest thing about her.- The book was just a slog. I had to force myself to keep reading.My review is sub-par, butthis one that I came acrossdescribes my thoughts perfectly and is also entertaining, so check it out if you want more thoughts. Overall, I was just disappointed in this one because the vampire characters I've come to know and love (or at least be intrigued by) were hardly in it.Recommended For:Fans of Books 1-4 in Anne Rice's Vampire Chronicles. Anyone who likes beautiful yet deadly vampires, descriptive writing, and amazingly complex characters. (Well, maybe not this particular book in the series.)Original Review @ Metaphors and Moonlight
