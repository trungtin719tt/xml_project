I readLove Storybecause I didn't want to see the movie, but I wanted to know what everyone was talking about. While it was an affecting and sentimental little story, even at that young age I felt that it was trying too hard to tug on my heartstrings. It seemed, somehow, too juvenile, even to my then very juvenile mind. In later years, I came to realize that the movie's oft quoted line, "Love means never having to say you're sorry" is a complete falsehood. In fact, love meansalwaysbeing willing to say your sorry, and to mean it. Love grows stronger with humility, and the height of pride is the belief that a union can survive an unrepentant attitude.
