well this was all kinds of pointlessand also depressing.ugh!the writing is so manneredit is an affectationa studied display of real or pretended feeling.the whole book lacks affect;it lacks the real emotionthat it so desperately tries to conveyin its own affect-less way.the writer has talentsurebut here it is squandered.I like the premise, it's enticing;who doesn't want to read aboutthe fragile cloistered livesof insular rich white peoplewho summer on their own private island?makes us not-rich people feel betterreading about the miserable rich.I guess?but why go to all that troublesetting up class critiqueand racial tensionsand family dramaand dressing it up in fairy tale finerywhen that will all just be thrown awayon a maudlin twist endingwith a corny moral message:"Be a little kinder"...ugh!those ideas went nowherethose ideas were rendered pointlessbecause in the end the bookis not a scouring brillo pad after all,it's just another soppy wet sponge.rub that sponge on your faceit will look like you cried!
