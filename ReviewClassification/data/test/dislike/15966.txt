OK, I really need to stop reading Nicholas Sparks. Everytime I read something by him I think "Right. That's it. I will not waste anymore time in my precious short life reading his bland, shmaltzy, velveeta cheese like substance novels. But then one of the many people (and yes, well educated people) I know will say "Oh, but Kristen, you should read his latest book. You'll like this one." I fall for it everytime. This book, I was told by numerous people was different because it was darker, not as marshmallowy (that was my adjective, not theirs) as his other books, so I read it. And I disliked it. A lot.It just seems like every male character and every female in all of his books are really just the same people only with different names and occupations. And they are all so boring. Just once i would like a Sparks character to say f*** or talk about their periods, or not like kids and have it not be because they are the villain. Having said that, I had the pleasure of talking with a 96 year old lady at the hospital the other day and she had this book sitting on her bedside table and told me she likes N Sparks' novels "because they aren't too racy for me" which I thought was adorable so hats off to Mr Sparks for providing a good read for people of a certain age and disposition.However.This book especially irritated me with the whole "dead wife's ghost trying to fix up hubby with some new sweet young thing to raise their kids and have great sex with plot" eww. eww. eww. Maybe I'm just not spiritually mature enough, but the whole thing just smacked of ridiculous male fantasy. It's one thing if the wife is really just dead and wrote a letter to whomever might someday take her place, but the idea that she is going to be looking down from heaven watching them...well if I was the new wife I would be very creeped out. And then, what happens when they all get to heaven someday? Is there going to be a wife sharing situation, or will wife number one have moved on and shacked up with some other guy?? I know I'm sorry, but it BOTHERS me.Wow. So, I guess I have some issues. Anyway, I vow that this really really was my last Sparks novel. This time I mean it!p.s.

My then grade school aged son even felt the need to come into my bedroom and pat my leg saying "It's OK mom, it's only a movie"
