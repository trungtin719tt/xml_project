So much hatred for this book.Perhaps I will write a more comprehensive explanation of my rage at a later date, but for now I will say this:When Will and Lake's relationship is tested (in a totally contrived way I might add), Lake - after giving him the silent treatment for a few days - tells him that she just needs time to think about their relationship.Now i get that if you're on the receiving end of that statement, that can sound pretty scary. But Will goes so over the line to stalkerific that I just couldn't deal. He gets their 11 year old neighbor to knock on her door so that he can FORCE HIS WAY INTO HER HOUSE, Y'ALL!, he keeps something very personal at his house to force her to continue to come back to his house, and at the point at which I jumped ship with this book, hemotherfucking cut her car battery so that she had to ride to Detroit with him!No. No!!!! Christian/Travis/Edward let this girl fucking breathe! I get it. You're worried that if she thinks about this for 5minutes she will realize that she needs to run away from you like Usain Bolt. But in this case, what Will did wasn't actually all that bad, it was more of a "why didnt you tell me" thing. But that's beside the point. I understand the impulse to make your case and make your s.o. talk to you when they're mad. But if you love someone - anyone, bf, friend, whatever - you have to respect their feelings, even if what they are feeling is hate for your dumb ass. There is a way to make your presence known, to remind someone of why they love you, without turning into Kathy Bates from misery and removing all their freedom from you.The last line I read, perhaps the last line I will ever read by this author said this:"you would think that after a year I would have found a way to get through to heror to manipulate her in some way."Goddamn it how many times do I have to say this shit: MANIPULATION IS NOT LOVE! It just fucking isn't. Am I talking to myself here? Because I keep having to say this shit. To women. Over and over again. Am I not being clear? Because I really truly don't know how to say it better than that.Dear YA authors: have you ever been manipulated or tricked into doing something you didn't want to do? Dd it leave you feeling grateful that somebody forced you to do something so you didn't have to worry your pretty little head with figuring out what YOU wanted?Yeah, that's what I thought.So maybe it gets better. Maybe Will mans up, maybe Lake calms down, maybe some shit starts happening other than Will's incessant whining. But I don't have enough faith in this story to take that chance.
