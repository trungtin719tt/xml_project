I gave this book 2 stars because ofCalla.Calla acted like an immature, self-absorbed drama queen for 90% of the book and I found it impossible to like her. Andrea Cremer couldn't decide if she wanted Calla to be a tomboy or a girly-girl so Calla goes from blushing over something as trivial as wearing skirts to flirting blatantly in the same chapter. The inconsistencies in her character had me rolling my eyes more than just a few times. Calla is supposedly a badass (she's called that by at least one person in the book), but she swoons at even the slightest hint of romance or sex - can you really call that tough? She's an Alpha, but is in truth only a figurehead for the Keepers, magic-wielders who organize the Guardian packs. Not only that, but she's very oblivious to the personal problems of her pack members and can't manage to help them even when she does realize (I'm referring to Mason/Nev and Ansel/Bryn here).However, all the aforementioned issues are minor in comparison to Calla's treatment of Ren and Shay, her two love interests. She keeps both of them on her hook for the entire book, at times kissing one boy then turning around and making false promises to the other, always lying to everyone involved. The worst part is that Calla didn't even seem to realize how cruel, deceiving, and selfish she was being; it was as if she thought she had a right to both boys. If you ask me, she deserved neither.The world-building saved Nightshade from getting just one star. I expected the book to focus on werewolves (called the Guardians) but it branched out into a whole world of supernatural creatures. The warring factions of Searchers and Keepers, winged succubi, and other well-imagined beings made the story more interesting and moved the plot forward. Also, the mention of succubi made me think of Bo from Lost Girl, my favorite badass!If I continue this series it will be to hear more about the world Andrea Cremer thought up outside of Calla's self-absorbed bubble.
