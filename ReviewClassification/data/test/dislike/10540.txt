I don't even know where to start with this one. The book was basically a whole load of nothing. It's the absolute definition of ''trying too hard.'' I don't care how many big words Shriver knows the meaning of. Throwing them in so often only made for muddled, disjointed, boring to read sentences.There's no story. We know from the beginning that Kevin has shot a bunch of students dead, and then Eva goes on to tell random, often exaggerated stories from his childhood leading up to the shooting.The characters are so very unlikable. Eva decides from day 1- literally- that Kevin is evil and out to get her. He's only a few minutes old when she decides he's plotting against her. When Kevin is 18 months old, she sit in front of him and calls him a ''little shit.'' The level of paranoia displayed by Eva is absolutely ridiculous- it's no wonder Kevin took a dislike to her as he grew older.Kevin was no better than Eva. He's a horrible piece of work, with no sympathy for anyone. It's clear he's a very disturbed person, but I honestly believe half of it was from trying to get some sort of maternal reaction out of his mother, some sign that she actually cared about him in the slightest.Franklin was just plain irritating. He lived in his own little world where his son was perfect- despite the fact that he seriously injured his little sister for a start- and is convinced they have a ''great relationship'' when all along Kevin clearly couldn't care less about his father.I very much disliked the ending. All the characters were suddenly revealed as the complete opposite to what they'd been for the other 400 pages, and I felt a little cheated. There was no need to strive for a somewhat happy ending, when the rest of the book was already very disturbing.
