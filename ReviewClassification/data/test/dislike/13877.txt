The first part of this book is well done. Frey does describe what it is like to be an addict well. I'm one &amp; I know. After that, it was pure fiction - very dangerous fiction for an addict.From his description, I believe he went to the same treatment center as I did. They would never allow him to run his own program or pull half the crap he said he did. His best thinking &amp; will power got him to treatment. It isn't logical nor part of any reputable treatment plan, to allow the addict to cure himself. If it was, none of us would ever be in a treatment center in the first place. I went there because it was that or death.My mother read the book &amp; said it gave her an insight into my disease she had never had before. Kudos for that. Seriously, I am most thankful &amp; it's the only reason this didn't get a single star. She believed the whole book - I knew most of it was fiction way before Oprah finally got around to saying it.Thumbs down to Oprah on this one - she had to know it too, from her medical expert who supposedly told her well before air time. As for Mr. Frey, he got his moment of fame, probably a lot of money &amp; hopefully he really isn't an addict or it will likely kill him.There are better ways for a loved one to know what it is like to be an addict. If that person won't go to AA, NA or Alanon - if you think this is the only way for them to learn - by all means give them the book. Just rip the last half to 2/3 of it out first.
