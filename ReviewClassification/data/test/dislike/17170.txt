Starting this book was like going to the opening of a new nightclub.Everything is glitzy and glamorous, everyone is happy and smiling, there is a VERY attractive barman helping you to the most delicious drinks all night. Your new red stilettos get loads of complements and you dance the night away with energy to spare.Finishing this book was like seeing this same nightclub the next morning.The air is stale and smells slightly of vomit, the tables are sticky with spilled drinks, the carpet is full of cigarette burns and the barman actually has bad teeth and a lazy eye.
