I started reading this with my boy ages ago, but I never got around to marking it as finished here on Goodreads.Generally speaking, I enjoyed reading him the book, and he liked hearing it. I have a nostalgia for the Narnia Chronicles, too. And that makes these books a little sweeter for me.My younger boy (age 3.5 at the time of reading) enjoyed it too. Especially some of the more action-oriented scenes, and the stuff underground.
