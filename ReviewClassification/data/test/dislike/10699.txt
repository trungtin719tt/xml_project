When I started reading this book, I really had no idea what it was about. Maybe I live under a rock, but I didn't know that it was on Oprah's book club list. As I read the first few pages, I felt as though the authoress was writing an infomercial... trying REALLY hard to sell me something.The basic idea of this book is about the secret of complete happiness and to getting everything you want. Her theory condensed is that positive thinking will get you everything you want. I like the idea that being positive will make you a happier person, but to go so far as to say that "the universe will align in your favor" and you will get everything you desire... well, that's a bit much. She even claims that one will lose weight, not by living a healthier lifestyle, but by asking for it and expecting it. And that the war in Iraq will end if we have positive thoughts about that and sit back and expect it to happen. Her idea that you merely ask for something and wait... that you don't need to do anything for yourself, you just ask... now what good does that promote?Overall, it was an ok read. I don't consider it a waste of time because I do consciously try to be more positive. I've taken some of her tips (like thinking about the things you are happy for, being more grateful, being more conscious of your thoughts and feelings) to heart. I got some good things from this book, but there was no amazing secret in it, nor was it anything I had never heard before.Oh, and the whole concept of the secret is described in full in the first chapter. Reading the remainder of the chapters in this book was like listening to a not so favorite song on repeat.If you're looking for a motivational read like this, I'd recommend you go with something by Anthony Robbins... he preaches the same stuff, but in a much more fulfilling way.
