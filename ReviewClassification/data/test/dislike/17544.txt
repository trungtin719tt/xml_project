Yikes- this series really is a train wreck! I really gave up all hope of these books getting better about five books ago but I've made it to book eight and just can't look away from the disaster. They are so bad it's almost amusing.Firstly, I find it highly ironic that the Casts dedicated this book to ''LGBT teens everywhere'' given the fact that the two gay characters in these books arewalking stereotypes.They are not presented as gay characters- they are presented as girls! Called Queen Damien and Miss Jack. Told they don't ''count as guys because they're gay.'' Jack spends his time fainting, crying, giggling, squealing etc.There is only one major scene inAwakenedwhere Damien, Jack and all the gang are together and it is shockingly bad-everysentence is mentioning that they're gay- we get it, we've known for the last eight books! This, coupled with the ''dedication'', only further validates my opinion that the Casts are just looking for a pat on the back for having gay characters.Zoey is worse than ever! She really is the biggest Mary Sue I have ever come across in YA literature- it's appalling and I think she sets a terrible example for any younger teens who might be reading these books and thinking this is actually acceptable and healthy behaviour for a 16 year old girl. As usual, she hasallthe guys falling all over her. Stark is just a male version of Zoey. They have nothing in common and their relationship is so over the top and cheesy. I was cringing at many of their conversations. We're on book eight and Zoey still can't let go of Heath yet at the same time she has no problem going with some other guy.OfcourseErik had to forgive Zoey, even though she's never been anything but awful and unfaithful to him. I just don't get why he still sees her desirable even as a friend. Zoey gets everything she wants in this book and acts like a spoiled five year old! She's apparently all powerful and chosen and everything... yet she runs off to an island and basically says ''I'm just going to stay here so I don't have to deal with any of my responsibilities'' and leaves her friends alone to deal with it.I'msoover Kalona. And Neferet. And Rephaim and Stevie-Rae. These plots and relationships are SO overdone at this stage! Kalona hasn't interested me since the first time he entered the series. The whole Neferet thing is so played out- it just keeps going back and forth. Stevie-Rae and her bird-lover is just, well, creepy. Every time any of these characters started narrating I just switched off.Aphrodite has really been pushed into the background which is a shame! By the time we got to page thirty, I had counted 9 times in which Zoey and her gang had insulted, mocked and shamed Aphrodite. It's just appalling. Sure- there's a personality clash there- but Aphrodite has been nothing but helpful to them for books upon books. Zoey decided she was a slut at the beginning of book one (for doing nothing bad at all) and even though Zoey has done ten times more things with ten times more guys, while Aphrodite is with one nice guy,Aphroditeis still the slut and the one who is beneath the rest of them. It really sucks because she's the one decent character left. Zoey and her friends need to grow up and realize they're not funny or witty- just mean and immature.The switching of narrators is so bad- it's obviously just because the Casts can't handle writing a book without showing the plot from every single angle, thereby leaving no questions at all. It's really annoying. And this book is going date so bad! It's all pop culture references, especially for the first half of the book. They mention Glee, True Blood, iPods, Anita Blake, Twitter... the first 50 pages are like an advertisement.Overall, yeah, it's bad but I can't look away after making it this far and now I'm just wondering how bad it can actually get.For more of my reviews and recommendations, visit my blog:here
