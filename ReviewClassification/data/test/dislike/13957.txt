What makes a novel truly good is that it can stand on the quality of the writing alone.To coast along (saleswise or otherwise) on the coattails of subject matter, is, I think, cheating.ThatStill Aliceis about Alzheimer's Disease is, I would guess, a good part of the reason that so many people have responded so well to it.Fair enough: Every reader brings their personal history to every book they read. And if they have witnessed lives of dear ones being derailed by Alzheimer's, they will read this book with a sense of familiarity, of kinship even, knowing too intimately well the wounds it has bludgeoned them with.Fair enough.Still none of that is enough to excuse the faults that keep this book from being a well-written novel--it simplyisn'tone. The characters are thin and weakly-defined, and there are too many jarring moments where it merely reads like a helpfully informative brochure about Alzheimer's.Actually, reading a brochure, or an article about it in a medical journal would've felt more honest.I suppose I'm informed now.But somehow I also feel cheated...
