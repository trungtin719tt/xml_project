I have ambivalent feelings about this book. It's fatally flawed in my opinion, both in tone and content.The tone is adolescent hyper-drama.... which is okay I suppose since it's written for a teen audience. But, as an example of literature, it falls flat and since my interest in YA lit is exclusively how it might be used in the classroom or whether I can suggest the book for outside reading, I have to say, it's a problem. Soaking in a gossipy, soap opera loop of teenage angst and action adventure takes time away from the substance of the novel. I almost get the feeling that the writer was channeling its cgi potential and planning out some Dawson Creek/Buffy dialogue while writing it.None of this would keep me from wanting to use the book in a classroom, however. What is a deal breaker is in the content itself. TheSpecialSpecials (or mean girl police force of this society) are called Cutters. And they stay "icy" (translated: aware and outside of their programming) by cutting themselves with knives.This particular direction takes the book off the shelves for classroom use and I'm disappointed. Cutting as a means for becoming more "real" is such a bad choice on Westerfeld's part... Why suggest cutting as an experimental tool for enlightenment to an audience that is already so impressionable and self dramatizing? It's not essential to the story... although the entire book is suffused with cutting references, really it's just a plot conceit that could have been nearly anything else. He later illustrates a better way to become icy but it's too little too late.Then, of course, the next question is can I promote any of the books now? Can I teach one in my classroom if a later one in the series is objectionable. I don't know.
