Oh God! shoot me! I was really being patient with this series. After all the make outs,hook ups, betrayal,death,resurrection,hoe-ing. I really thought this was the last book. Can you say overkill? Why kill a person, oh wait make that 4 or more people, if all of them will just live again. All of them? really? The biggest overkill for me is Kalona bird man immortal warrior and his bitch deity Neferet. Is he really a bad guy? If he's so powerful and smart then how come Neferet have him on a leash.You wanna know this book's life saver?Aphrodite and Darius they are such a great team. I hope the two of them doesn't "die". Stevie Rae and Rephaim's love story is also adorable. And again I hope they dont "die".Oh I almost forgot... I really wanna scream this at Zoey while she was on VACATION."WHADDA FUCK ZOE! THE WORLD IS ENDING, A FRIEND HAS DIED, AGAIN, WHILE YOU PLAY AROUND WITH LITTLE FAIRIES. NEFERET IS PLOTTING SOMETHIN WHILE YOU AND STARK ARE PUMPING AWAY UNDER A TREE! (DEEP BREATH)"I know zoey is supposed to be a teen but still, if you were in her shoes would you be able to take a vaca like that?Ehem! *blush* sorry I got a little carried away there. I just really wanna let it out
