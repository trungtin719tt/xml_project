DNF at 37%What Actually Went Through My Head While I Was Reading ThisStupid moron. I can't believe he lent me a book without thoroughly knowing my taste.Way to ruin a book for someone.Hey, this is actually pretty good!I hate everything.That's hilarious.Time to think about all those scholarships you haven't filled out yet......So lazy.Did I fall asleep?I think I just stared at this page for half an hour.This plot is really interesting, but I can't focus.Focus already!Time to think about all the gargantuan college-related books you'll have to read within the next year...Sooooooooooooooooooo slow. Keep it up, Grandma.This is the most difficult book to read and it really shouldn't be.These brownies are gross, but at least they're not distracting me.BOREDBOREDBOREDBOREDBOREDBOREDBOREDHey, that article looks really interesting!Ughhhh...can't concentrate.*plays Bohemian Rhapsody on repeat*I think the best thing to do in this situation is take a nap and feel bad about it later.Time to think about how many people will judge my character based on my review of this book...Biggest reading slump ever.I am so done.
