I didn't realize that this book was based on Fundamentalist Christianity when I downloaded it from Audible.com. The story started out just like any science fiction fantasy book and then introduced a Christian component which I was perfectly fine with though I originally thought it was merely a basic good vs. evil type story. Being a C.S. Lewis fan (also of his Christian essays and books) I didn't have any problem with the book until it started to demonized and vilify "Eastern Mysticism". Now many religions and philosophies fall under that umbrella and while it was never specifically stated it insinuated that, among other religions that strive to do good, Buddhism is anti-Christian and even Satanic in nature which just isn't true. Part of the reason I believe that it was Buddhism that was being rebuked is: the importance of meditation, the reference to dragons (described as dragons but written as demons) (which mean a different thing in Buddhism than it does in Christianity) and several other practices I saw misinterpreted and maligned. The book portrayed these aspects in a very ugly light and was often out and out incorrect in what the Buddhist practice is about. Granted, Buddhism is non-theist religion, but it isn't anti-theist. There is a big difference. Western Buddhism often has no problem having od or Christ incorporated into its practices. The 2,500 year old view is to be compassionate to every living thing. There's also the Three Pure Precepts: to not create evil, to practice good, and to actualize good for others. Not very demonic in my book. Saving the environment and animals that God created hardly seems to me a heretical or blasphemous act.The message about God and Christ would have been quite enlightening and influential if it weren't for the Eastern beliefs bashing which really turned me off from the book. If it weren't for that I would have given the book 4 stars **** As it was well written for fantasy writing, and had a decent adventurous story line.It would have been very easy for them to be a quiet satanic cult under the guise of Christianity which they did cover, but it satanism that uses, always, Eastern 'Mysticism' or religion as its right arm. Again, I would have liked it had it not equated Eastern Religions with Satanism. One's failure to believe in God does not equate being evil. There are many who are moral and ethical who believe different things or incorporate different aspects into their beliefs. Hate is not what Jesus proposed but loving those who may not be awake in the manner in which you think they should.
