I certainly didn't intend to spend the larger part of my summer getting through The Blind Assassin. I can't really put my finger on why this didn't engage me. The writing was interesting and brilliant, but the story itself just didn't propel me.There is the story of two sisters growing up in the 1900's in Toronto. Their mother dies at a young age and the tale is of their father trying to raise them with their wise housekeeper's help, his business failings, the World Wars, and the elder sister's arranged marriage; as well as a series of events leading up to the younger sister's suicide at the age of 25.Then there's the story within the story...of two lovers meeting secretly. He spins for her science fiction stories...one of which is entitled The Blind Assassin. Not until the end do we find out the true identities of the lovers, the writers of the story, and all sorts of paternity issues and family secrets.The epic nature of the book is ambitious, and the writer sees it through. No stone is unturned as the plot revelations come to fruition. What's unusual about the main character, the elder sister, Iris, is her lack of emotion about the tragic elements of the story. It's like she's not even remorseful that she turned the blind eye to her sister's sufferings, as if she herself were the victim.I wish I had picked another Margaret Atwood book to begin with. I think I would have liked another better. I'm glad I got through this. I enjoyed some of the philosphical quips and the flat tone of the book, but I feel like I have already forgotten the story. Maybe I'm just missing something, because it's evidently a modern classic.
