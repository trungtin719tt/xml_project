~*~*~*UPDATE, September 2017*~*~*~ It's been nearly ten years since I wrote this review and I continue to be amazed by the response to it. I'm totally blown away by all the chords I've struck and nerves I've hit with this dumb thing over the years. I'm frankly a little embarrassed by it and I've toyed with the idea of just taking it down all together, but I think I'll leave it up because it seems to spark conversation. I would just like to reiterate that it's been ten years since I wrote this and I don't know that it actually reflects the way I would feel about the book if I read it now, so please don't yell at me about it - I don't even know how I could possibly respond. I can't remember the book all that well and I double can't remember why I felt the way I did about it. I think there's actually a pretty good chance that I might like this if I were to read it again.I'm sorry younger me was a little brash. I'm also sorry for calling out Radiohead the way I did. I still don't care about them, but I also don't care if you do!~*~*~**~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~I wish there were someway that a sigh could count as a book review.House of Leaves is a really, really damn good story. It's about a guy named Johnny Truant who finds a manuscript in a dead man's apartment. Said manuscript is entitledthe Navidson Record. It's essentially a dissertation on a documentary of the same name, by and about a man named Will Navidson and his family. Navidson lives in a house that is larger on the inside than it is on the outside, sometimes only a small fraction of an inch larger, sometimes miles.After a quick bit of research Johnny figures out that the Navidson Record, and pretty much everything related to it, does not exist. Johnny becomes obsessed with the whole thing and it drives him crazy.I think it's a really great story. However,House of Leavesis the perfect definition of bullshit.You see, it's got an experimental narrative. People will tell you that it's hard to follow, but those are probably the same people who told you that the Matrix required multiple viewings to understand. The book is written by a fictional character named Zampano, he is the dead man I mentioned above in my synopsis of the story. Johnny Truant, who is more or less the books protagonist, chimes in via an introduction and constant foot notations that he's added to Zampano's work. Most of his foot notes however meander off into him rambling about things that have happened to him in his day to day life (mostly fucking a million super hot babes). It should also be noted that the Zampano character has made a retarded amount of foot notes. See, notthatcomplicated.What really got my goat here is all the goddamn, cutesy little "look how clever I am I"/"I'm a major in art and a minor in lit" bullshit. It starts off simple enough with that kind of stuff. Every time the word "house" comes up the text is blue, no matter what language (and there are several), no matter what. That's a kind of cool little thing, I'm ok with that, but then Danielewski decides that he's going to masturbate from page 119 to page 709. There are annoying text blocking boxes in the middle of about thirty pages that contain text in them that is so clipped and cut off that you can't read it. You have to turn the page sideways and upside down continuously for hundred page stretches at a time, and these pages tend to have a small paragraph at the very best (often times only one or two words), making you flip through the pages very fast. There are footnotes all over the fucking pages making it a big pain in the ass to know what you are supposed to be reading and in what order. Then at the end he has the fucking gall to imply that there are hidden messages encoded throughout the book andyou should go back and find them. It is a seriously frustrating book to read.There is no doubt thatHouse of Leavesis extremely clever, and it's undoubtedly the most exhaustive work of fiction I have ever read. The foot notes alone, which I gather are 98% referencing material that does not really exist, are impressive. Danielewski really worked his ass off on this and it shows. I respectHouse of Leaves, I cannot stress how much I loved the story, but I pretty much hate the book.This book looks at you with this smug fucking smile on it's face, daring you to say that you don't like it, knowing that masses of people are going to go along with it because they don't want to look stupid. That's what this is. It's the fucking Radiohead of books. Well,House of Leaves, I am not stupid and I'm calling your bullshit. Fuck you.
