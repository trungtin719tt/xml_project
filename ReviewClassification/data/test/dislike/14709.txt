Wow that was a whole lot of build up for not much to happen. Might have worked better for those reading this series as each book came out, but since I'm binge reading all these books back to back (for the first time) this felt pointless. I finished it yesterday and am already struggling to remember what happened in Opal as opposed to the previous book.While I am starting to understand Daemon more and am feeling more emotion behind his and Katy's relationship, I'm also getting more annoyed with how angry Daemon always is and how often he beats up Blake. It's a one note song.Audiobook review:Same narrator as the first 2 books. Aside from pronouncing Daemon's name wrong, she's a good narrator. Would recommend.tw: One line of strong fat shaming. Violence. Imprisonment. Different characters are grieving the loss of a partner, sibling, or friend.
