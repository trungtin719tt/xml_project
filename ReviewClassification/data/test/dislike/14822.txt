Problems with rewriting Hamlet as a story about dog-breeders in Wisconsin:(1) Hamlet is already pretty good, and most writers don't profit by inviting the comparison.(2) It makes the plot pretty predictable, which is a problem for what was apparently supposed to be an adventure novel. Yes, Claude did it! (By the way, DW, why did he do it?) No, it's not Claude listening to your conversation with mom! Sigh.(3) The worst mistake you can make in an animal story, I think, is killing off a beloved pet for dramatic effect. It's like kicking the reader in the groin: it's a cheap shot, and no one can feel good about it. Almondine should have been Horatio, not Ophelia -- I was quite willing to see all the main characters die if it meant the dog made it out alive.. . . The second chapter of this book was absolutely beautiful. The rest made me grumpy -- Wroblewski obviously has enormous desciptive talent, and there's a sense of joy in his description of dogs that made me want to love the book, but I think his good intentions were hijacked by a misguided interest in Hamlet that gave him cover for his failure to figure out what to do with all these interesting ideas.
