This book was chosen by my book club, otherwise I wouldn't have read it. To be honest, I just couldn't wax philosophical with Anne. All I could think about when Anne was discussing marriage and women's roles was about her personal life and the affairs both she and Charles had. I'm not judging them, only they know what went on in their marriage, but, at the same time, I didn't find myself inclined to take marriage advice from her. I thought it was strange that she kept quoting Antoine de Saint-Exupery throughout the book until I found out that she had an affair with him. Then, her apparent admiration for him made more sense (don't get me wrong--Exupery wrote some amazing things, namely The Little Prince). I think Anne had some thought-provoking points to her musings, but it was overly poetic and also a little depressing for me. Her continued mentioning of needing to be alone and getting away from everyone gave me the impression of a woman who wanted a different life.In short, I didn't get out of this what I was hoping to. The best part of the book was the imagery of the ocean in the first chapter. 1.5 stars, rounded to 2.
