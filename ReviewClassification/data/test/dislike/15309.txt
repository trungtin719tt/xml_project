This book could have been subtitled "How to Wind About Four Different Tiny Storylines into One Relatively Small Book and Maintain a Ridiculous Level of Detail So That Readers Can Calculate Exactly How Much Coffee My Heroine Drinks Each Day". Yes, it would have made marketing the book a bit difficult, but might have given readers a better idea of what to expect.Sookie encounters a war in the were community, then a war between the vampires, then she breaks off her relationship, then she discovers a long lost relative, then she discovers another long lost relative. Phew. I liked a couple of the storylines, but mashing them all together like that made them lose their potency and makes the book a lot weaker. This is the most recent published book in this series, so I can stop reading for a while now and feel a bit relieved at the prospect. I think the only thing that kept me reading these mediocre books was the fantastic TV series based on the series,True Blood- can't wait for season 2.
