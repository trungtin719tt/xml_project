Well I enjoy my light reads, particularly Marian Keyes, so I thought I'd get a kick out of the Shopaholic series-not so.The protagonist is irritating and irrational to the point of annoyance.I surmise though that this series and it's popularity has to do with how people view money. I like shopping, but have never spent outside my means to the point of debt. I personally think that's stupid.I don't fully get the "have-to-have-it" mentality ESPECIALLY with pricey goods.So I didn't relate to the character at all.I gave it one star because everything has it's place, and it was good I read it to find out that I didn't like it.haha
