The review is for the part that I managed to read, between 1/3 and 1/2. I didn't finish the book.I lied. I didn't drink, but I'll tell you anywayWow, this heroine is just the stupidest and the most selfish out there. Think of a crappy woman and then multiply it by 10 and you have this chick!SPOILERS!!!!!She says she loves her boyfriend and when he took a job for 2 years in another city she flips out and dumps him. That wouldn't have been so bad if she didn't get drunk(not the bad part) and THAN slept his his friend! The idiot left his job and got home to her and the crazy bitch didn't even tell him that she cheated! She just f*cks his brains out and the next morning asks his friend, Kellen, if they are still ok!My problem isn't that she cheated(ok.... about 50% it is), it's just that she pretends it never happened wants to keep things like they were before the fact, and, believe it or not, keeps cheating with the guy when her boyfriend is home!I just can't fathom such a selfish, moronic, naive, imbecile of a human being!/SPOILERSBesides this the author kept repeating the words: sweet, cute, adorable... about a dude! And she kept saying and saying and saying and saying it till she drove me cray-cray!I'm never picking this author up again.Summary:(it doesn't cover everything, but it works)
