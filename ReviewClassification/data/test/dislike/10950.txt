Before I begin this, I'd like to say that it's a rant. For those of you who don't like ranting- Don't read it. I actually happened to love this book, but I'm just a tad mad at the ending at the moment.Dear Christopher Paolini,How. Could. You.(view spoiler)[ You wrote four MONSOROUS TOMES of creative genuis, and you couldn't even SPARE ASENTENCEfor Eragon and Arya! I don't care if you're the author, and you have your little creative steaks of whimsy, but it's just damn logical that they should be together- They even admitted it themselves!!! And okay, fine, maybe they didn'thaveto traipse off to some mystical, magical other land together, but a kiss would have been nice?! Or even some form of romance other than... well... I CAN'T EVEN COMPARE IT TO ANYTHING BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T PUT ANY ERAGON/ARYA ROMANCE IN THERE!And then you had the AUDACITY, to go and hint at the Nasuada/Murtagh romance and then PULL IT OUT FROM RIGHT UNDER OUR NOSES! NO! THAT IS NOT RIGHT!I want a re-write of the ending! I know that your plot was amazingly brilliant and that all the details were intricate and perfect. To be honest I couldn't help but love every single damn page of that stupid story- but to me the ending just wasn't right!Thus, it is with much regret that I invite everyone who was as dissatisfied as me to a bonfire that uses the last 80 or so pages of Inheritance as kindling (I WARNED YOU PAOLINI!)... But not really. Because I would never destroy books, and I don't actually own the copy I'm reading.(hide spoiler)]Sincerely,A Very Angry Fan.
