I am speechless. Where do I begin?It was sort of good, I was even heading toward 4 stars when I started the book, giving me interesting, emotionally connective banter (see my notes) that I was starting to feel glad I continued with Book 2. But right now, unless my reading buddy group dragged me or persuaded me with arguments too powerful to resist, I am NOT getting Book 3 or any other book in the series.Where to begin with the disappointment? I will preface by saying that maybe my expectations about the book/ series is just wrong. And if so, I feel kind of bad about giving a low rating because of my own misaligned expectations. Nevertheless, I paid for the books and read them. So the low rating stands.My review of Book 1 is still how I feel about Book 2. With the following adds:* Events that happen in this series seem to be planned so that the reader can slowly discover the various powers of the various characters, and the ultimate mystery that keeps people going - who is Jericho Barrons? What does he want with the book? What do the other characters want with the book? (but the other characters are secondary.)The most compelling character in this series for me is not the heroine, I honestly couldn't care less for her. The only compelling character is JB.And if I'm in a better mood I might pick up Book 3 just to see where JB is headed. OR, I might just read other people's reviews and save myself the $ and time.* Given above,events in this series don't seem to follow much plot or evolution. They're just devices to pepper in more mystery and pseudo discovery- Oh, Malluce isn't really who we thought. He's just weirder and scarier. And the twenty odd pages of torture was for... what purpose exactly?* There's no real emotional connection between the characters.I said this already for Book 1 and I was hoping things would change in Book 2 and was almost optimistic they would, and then we're back to flatness. There's a pseudo sex scene that is extremely weird and displaced given the situation and did nothing to further the relationship between the two main characters. I am left deeply unsatisfied after reading it.I don't get it. Is this a paranormal thriller? paranormal horror book? certainly not a paranormal romance, nor really all that fantasy like. But maybe I haven't read enough fantasy books to judge. It's just weird.I'm stumped.
