Spoilers be everywhere in this one.I have had some irritation with this series in the previous books, but nothing even close to how pissed off this book made me. Was there even a point to this mess? Because I didn't really see one.The missing memories courtesy of Mencheres seemed to come out of nowhere. When previously unknown events, that are a secret to all but one, pop up it doesn't seem clever, it just seems like the author pulled it out of her ass. Also, the fact that these events centered around another vampire who just happened to have a previous husband claim which conveniently led to tension between Cat and Bones... You see what I mean? Where did that come from?The relationship between Cat and Bones hit the skids big time here. I read this book with a huge knot in my stomach. It wasn't a nervous-but-excited-to-see-where-this-is-going knot. It was the kind of knot you get when you hear your parents having fight. You feel sick and wish it would just stop.Unfortunately, it doesn't stop. For about 3/4 of the book they snipe at each other and say horrible things. Cat also continues to fix any of her problems with a Gin and Tonic. It really seemed like they weren't the same characters anymore. If I didn't know it was the same series I wouldn't even recognize them. All the caring and love that characterized their relationship before seemed to morph into a weapon to club each other into misery with. It wasn't fun to read about. I don't enjoy watching characters treat each other this way and spew out these things they can never take back. For Gods sake, Bones had the nerve to question her commitment to their marriage because she wanted to know the truth of her marriage! (total jerk move by the way) Does that seem like the Bones from the last book? It sure doesn't to me!Vlad was the shining star of this story. When is he getting his own book? He is a great friend to Cat. I love that he pushes her about her feelings about Bones. That's what real friends do. They push you until you finally admit the truth. I felt so bad for him when he admitted that he missed sleeping with someone. Sleeping alone is one of the hardest things to get used to.Mencheres also played a part in this one, obviously. He didn't stand out much, but one thing did catch my attention. When and why did he lose his ability to see the future?Regarding Bones and Cat: There was no "right" person in their fights and separation. I felt more sympathy for Bones, but mostly because Cat burned through any sympathy I had for her in the last book with her handling of the Tate situation. That doesn't mean Bones was justified though. I do think the rant he blasts her with before he leaves is completely justified. I've been dying to say that to her for a few books now. But, Bones shouldn't have deliberately let Cat be hurt by her false assumptions. He knew exactly what she would think and he just let it happen.The whole point of the book seems to be to provide an extremely complicated set up to compel Cat to finally become a vampire. I can't help but think there was an easier (and more likable) way for the author to go about this. I find Cat's differences as a vampire intriguing, although I feel bad that she still can't be just one of the masses.As of this moment I do not plan to read anymore of the books following Cat and Bones. I do still plan to read the spin offs, but I just can't handle the mess they have made of their relationship anymore. I should have stopped reading at book 2.One last thing: How lame to be stuck with Justina for all eternity.
