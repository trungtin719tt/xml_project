For anyone looking for good, brainless, PG-13 rated vampire fun, this is probably the book for you. The author has a straightforward writing style and tells a straightforward story about an unpopular girl who gets the short end of the stick in a town ruled by vampires, until she makes some oh my god like totally cool and hottt friends. (Yes, "hot" needs three t's--one for each friend.)The book has a slightly juvenile tone, which is ironic since the main character--a brainiac who is sixteen years old and in college--spends much of the book insisting that she's not a little kid. I feel like a lot of the events weren't really thought out and were there to move the story along without really considering the repercussions. It's kind of like how, in Harry Potter, Harry always managed to get away scot-free--and sometimes even with a congratulatory pat on the head--in spite of all the times he ignored rules or authority to save the world/his friends/stuff. Except that this book doesn't even go that far. Eventually, I kind of just gave up all hope for at least some bit of realism.Long story short, not all that great for a first book, but I've been told the series gets better, so I'll give the second book a try.
