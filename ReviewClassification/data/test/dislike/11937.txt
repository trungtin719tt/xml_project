Finally finished the 5th book in this series (sometime this month) and I'm getting to the review part - YAY!I kind of really wish these books were a lot smaller. They just take so much time to read and to absorb all of the information thrown at you. I need time to decide if I like the book, characters, storyline, and everything else. Also, things definitely dragged on. I didn't care about what the hell was happening for more than half of the book. It just seemed like I was reading so much unnecessary information.The Fiery Crossis about Brianna, Roger, and Stephen. Oh look! Another triangle with a dash of awkwardness. Then there's the details about Brianna and her freaking boobs - I was getting annoyed a lot in this book if you couldn't tell.Now don't get me wrong, I have liked (maybe loved) most of the books I've read in this series but this book was a toss up. It should have been a much smaller book with way more interesting details. Diana gave you unnecessary drama and pages and pages of worthless crap. You could probably skip tons of chapters and not miss anything later on.Unlike most of the book, the ending was a whole lot better and actually piqued my freaking interest. The ending is what makes me what to read the next book - which I already know is not a small one. I just hope it's a lot more interesting.
