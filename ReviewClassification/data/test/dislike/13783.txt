August 2008This book seems to thumb its nose at the 1-5 star rating scale, and I almost can't decide what to think of it. Five stars? Well, the first part of the novel--the First Hotel New Hampshire--is certainly worth that. Four stars? In places, yes. Three stars? The ending, in the epilogue and the Third Hotel. Two stars and one star? Jesus God, the Second Hotel, Vienna, the return of Freud--and that bear!In a way,The Hotel New Hampshirefeels partly like a companion novel toThe World According to Garp. Where John Irving apparently spent his first three novels paving the way for, and building up to, Garp, with hints of that great book scattered here and there, waiting to be born, this novel after Garp feels like a glorified dumping-ground for all of Irving's leftover ideas: Vienna, whores, bears, the theme of rape, unusual childhoods, New England, doomed writers, strange sexual couplings, both the comic and tragic deaths--all of that is there, though altered, slightly twisted, made to fit an eccentric father and his eccentric family trapped in a serious world instead of a serious woman and her serious son trapped in an eccentric world.Yet despite all that, I can't really bring myself to hate this book. Like I said, it still feels like a companion piece to Garp, my favorite Irving book. What drew me intoThe World According to Garpwas the way Irving took a historical setting, postwar New England and Europe, and used that as a launching point to invent his own history (rather than starting with a slightly invented setting and using that as a launchpad for his characters to be shaped by history instead, as inA Prayer for Owen Meany), and that's the same thing that drew me into this book. Whatever else happened to America and the world in the '50s and '60s doesn't matter--here comes the Berry Family!So even if the mirrorThe Hotel New Hampshireholds up to Garp is one of those crazy twisted funhouse mirrors, I still have fond feelings for it. And because three stars is the average of five, four, three, two, and one--well, three stars it gets, and yet it's still a favorite.
