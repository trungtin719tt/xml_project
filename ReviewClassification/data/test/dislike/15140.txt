I read this book due to the fact that everyone else read it.Yes, mom I would jump off the cliff right behind everyone else.These are some fucked up characters. I think the new trend in books where every one of the characters is an asshole may be the way to go if you are writing a book that you want to take the world by storm with. The thing is...It gets frigging boring. I wanted a bus to hit them all. Repeatedly.May go sorta spoilery:You have Rachel. Rachel is a drunk, she gets on the 8:04 train every morning and then on again in the afternoon on her way home. Pretending to go to work. (She got fired for drinking and basically acting a damn fool)..so she goes on that same train every day.Sometimes she can't wait to take a drink before she gets home.She sees "Jess and Jason" everyday. Or that's what she calls them in her head. They live near her old home. Where she lived with her ex-husband (who cheated on her). Coincidence? I think not.She sees Jess kissing a guy that isn't Jason. So her little mind starts to working. Then Jess aka Megan goes missing.Rachel then decides to go to the police with what she knows. Then the police find out she is not the most reliable of witnesses and tell her to stay out of it. Of course, that's not happening.Now for the twist. That one I saw coming and kept thinking "no way" it can't be that easy. This book wouldn't be so popular.I need to stay away from super, duper popular books.Because, I'm just calling Bullshit.The writing is not bad in this book, so I'm not giving it the rating for that. I'm giving it the rating because I personally hated it.#trollscankissmyfatass
