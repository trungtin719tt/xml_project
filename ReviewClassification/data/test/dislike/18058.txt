OMGosh!!!!!!!I am so in love with this series - this book in particular. I feel so many emotions for it right now. This story world just keeps getting better and better, and I keep loving Daemon and Katy more and more.So amazingly awesome. Jen's writing is spectacular. So much yum.Oh, and don't get me started on how cool it is to have a literary reference to my book in this novel!!!!! How freaking surreal is that??? EEEK!!!I give this book off-the-charts stars. Can't wait to see what Jen has in store for us next. :-)
