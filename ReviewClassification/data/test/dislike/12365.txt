I'm not sure why I volunteered to jump into another Damned Dan Brown novel. What Circle of Dante'sInfernowas designed for a cynical, but weak reader who keeps returning to those crappy, popular authors (Damn Brown Brown,Orson Scott Card,Tom Clancy) of their youth hoping to drink from the waters of Bimini? What circle do you consign the novel's author?1.Limbo? Look, the novel isn't THAT horrible. Damned Dan Brown can be tolerably entertaining if you SIMPLY ignore his actual writing. He IS (as everyone keeps telling me) the master of page-turning historical mysteries, but I'm just not sure if that says MORE about page-turning historical mysteries, Damned Dan Brown, or us as readers.2.Lust? To be fair, while I despise Damned Dan Brown's actual words, his style, and his in-artful language, his plotting does somehow turn me on (occasionally) as a reader. While I am now convinced he hit his low-brow/high water mark withThe Da Vinci Code(Yes, it's all down hill from Leonardo Damned Dan Brown), this novel is slightly better than theThe Lost Symbolso --- I can't absolutely pan it (thus 2 stars).3.Gluttony? This is the most likely circle 'Inferno' belongs to. I think Damned Dan Brown's major issue is his self-indulgence. DDB's style is inflated, but doesn't actually inform. His metaphors are swollen. His descriptions are possessed of a majority gristle with very little actual literary meat. Half of the book reminds me of some obscure teenager's fan fiction site cribbing aLonely Planet Publication'sguide to write aboutFlorence,Venice, andIstanbul.4.Greed? It is obvious why Damned Dan Brown writes this way... because we (myself included) still buy it. It reminds me of why I hate it when directors in Hollywood become successful. They stop being interesting and instead become hacks. The reading public, much like the movie going public, demands mediocrity if the writer/director is going to be successful. Real art is not usually bought, real literature is most often ignored (I know that is a cliche, but it IS true). The amazing thing is that DDB started (in the beginning) as a hack and has just perfected hackery to a point where he will certainly be able to print money in 20 years by just publishing an Italian phone book.5.Anger? No, not really. It is more like regret. If I am angry (Notice how I shifted from the circles being about DDB to the circles being about me? If you aren't comfortable with those kind of style abortions/grammar shifts, you should probably not read Damned Dan Brown) it is an anger of what now passes as novel entertainment.6.Heresy? No, Damned Dan Brown definitely doesn't belong here. This is certainly a circle the Catholic church would have like to place him forThe Da Vinci Codebut 'Inferno' is mainly heretical to scholars of Dante, lonely Transhumanists, and perhaps the odd weekend, Malthusian alarmist.7.Violence? Again, because Damned Dan Brown is aiming for the center-mass of the pulp, paperback purchasing world, he isn't going to make his novel THAT graphic (plus DDB doesn't have theCormac McCarthywriting chops to paste together a single sentence that would actually scare the beJesus out of anyone). He made 'Inferno' grim in parts, he made it painful to read cover-to-cover, but violent? Meh.8.Fraud? 'Inferno' is simple and obvious rip-off of every dystopian SF novel about eugenics + a whole shelf of discount guide books + cheap James Bond knockoffs + a little bit of the 'Girl with the Dragon Tattoo'. But, since all writing is a crib, a rip-off, I can't really condemn Damned Dan Brown to Hell, at least to this circle for doing what everyone does, but he just does poorly. If DDB is condemned to the 8th circle it will be more forThe Da Vinci Code, which I believe is a boring, watered-down and mediocre version ofFoucault's Pendulum.9.Treachery? The further down into Hell you go, the more you realize it actually takes a lot of work to earn a place at these lower levels. That alone would discount Damned Dan Brown. It would also probably discount my review, since I just couldn't bring myself to spend an inordinate amount of time reviewing a book I wasn't all that impressed by.
