Do I have a category for "mess"? Nope.What about "sensationalistic drivel"? Nope.Maybe I should be grateful and take it as a good sign that I have not had to waste hours reading books that never should have been written. I just prodded through 628 pages of everything but the kitchen sink:SchizophreniaSucideHolocaustRacismVietnam RiotsChild AbuseWife AbuseInfidelityCancerAppalachian tragediesRescue of Sea TurtlesIncarceration...and I am only half through.What a disaster. Pat Conroy squeezed so much in, he absolutely lost his way. But I could forgive that, except for the feeling that this was done simply for the hopes of getting movie rights. I can't forgive this exploitation of those that suffered so horrifically during the Holocaust. To me that is just irresponsible writing. Both the writer and editor should have their pens taken away.
