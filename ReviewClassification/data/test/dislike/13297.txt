This was definitely my least favourite book by John Green.For starters, Colin was absolutely unbearable. I disliked him so much and I hated listening to his inner monologue. He was so pretentious, arrogant, self-centred and he was just plain horrible. I didn't like the constant anagrams, maths, graphs or his theorem rants. This book didn't really have much of a plot apart from focusing on Colin and so I just didn't like it. His constant ramblings about Katherine drove me up the wall. He compared EVERYTHING to Katherine and it was so annoying. Nothing happened in the book and it felt like Paper Towns all over again. I did like Hassan. Why someone like Hassan would be friends with someone like Colin is beyond me. My feelings about Lindsey are sort of confusing. On one hand I sort of liked her and on the other I sort of hated her. At the end of the day though she is basically Alaska / Margo. Alaska and Margo were also popular and pretty yet empty inside and completely miserable. Colin also felt very similar to John Green's other male protagonists. I think characters are John Greens downfall. He kind of just recycles all of his characters and I just want more from him!There was no character development or proper plot. The best thing about it was the writing. John Green does have a way with words, I just don't think he properly utilised that talent with this book. Another thing I didn't like was the way some of the characters were described. I don't know whether that was down to John Green's writing or Colin's perception of them but I found it distasteful (particularly the way Hassan and a waitress were described).I wouldn't recommend this to anyone but I love John Green so I'm going to keep reading his books.
