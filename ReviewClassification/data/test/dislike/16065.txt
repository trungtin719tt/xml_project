I guess I got caught up with all of the vampire folklore because of the Twilight series, and I was looking for a substitute. Blue Bloods is a light and to a small degree entertaining read. It kept me interested barely enough to want to finish the book, but it definitely was not captivating.I feel the author had an opportunity to develop her plot, which was extremely original. However, the entire novel lacked some sort of cohesive concept or stimulating event to give the storyline some needed spark. This book seemed to be more about fashion, cliques, partying and drinking than about vampire mythology.I bought the second and third book before I finished reading Blue Bloods, and I kind of wish I would have held off. I'm not jumping to the sequel; it's still sitting there on my shelf waiting to be read, however I'm just not that fascinated with the story. I'm sure I'll get around to it when I've exhausted my other options.
