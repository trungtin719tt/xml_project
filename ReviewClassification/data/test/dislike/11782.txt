Pioneer, or Bra-blazer, in the Mazophilous* Fantasy Genre[*mazophilous-- an "abnormal sexual focus on female breasts, or a breast fetishism"]To my female goodreads friends, in a few paragraphs I hope to explain the two rating so please bare with me, and don't assume the negative and bust me for being male. I've been honest and candid in all my reviews, so I'm not about to make a boob of myself here.This novel must be THE pioneer inmazophilousliterature, a/k/a mazolit.I've racked my brain and don't recall reading anything approaching this type of obsession in a literary novel by an estimable author: thefemale breastas an incandescent symbol repeated and varied in its iterations throughout the novel. The female protagonist is a twiggy 30-something physical therapist/masseuse, who is also a part-time assassin of abusers of women and children. Named Aomami (meaning, literally, "green beans"), she hasfrequent internal dialogues aboutfemale bosoms, thesmall size of her breastsand the resulting inferiority complex she suffers; she even"mourns" the loss of the breastsof 2 murdered women[if you think I'm lying, ask someone who has read this].Aomami experienced puppy love in grade school with the male protagonist but hasn't seen him since they were both 11. The cast also includes "little people" borne from a goat's mouth; a butterball of a reclusive cult leader who harbors a death wish; his doll-faced 17-year-old daughter with a stone-like personality andan ample bosomwho can serve as surrogate sex partner in storms; avery top-heavylady law enforcement officer who suffers nymphomania; a married middle-aged woman with "pyriform mammaries" [look, I promise you I'm not making this up] and an abnormal possessiveness of her young beau, who is the male protagonist, a part-time writer who teaches a cram course in math; a pestering, porcine private investigator; and, the protagonist's father, a cable bill collector, whose malevolent doppelganger bangs on doors for hours as he harasses the two female leads.Good news for me was that I could finally check the box by Haruki Murukami's name on my list of 1,000 authors to read before I die. I knew from reading descriptions of his novels that I was in for a story that was likely phantasmagoric. I settled on1Q84, despite its enormity - 928 pages originally published in Japan as a series of 3 novels.While the book generally maintained my interest, I could not shake off my wish that I was finished every time I picked it up. I'm pretty sure if I'd been more attuned to the parallel universe created (called 1Q84 or land of 2 moons), I'd have appreciated its plethora of symbols and literary structure.I wouldn't read it again.
