I have a long history with Murakami. I first read him about eleven years ago. I read The Elephant Vanishes, and loved it. Then I read a couple more. I don't remember the order: Dance Dance Dance, A Wild Sheep Chase, South of the Border West of the Sun, maybe a couple more. I loved them all. Then I tried Wind-Up Bird Chronicles and I just hit a wall. I had finally overdosed on Murakami. I couldn't get into it no matter how I tried, even though I didn't see anything objectively wrong with the book. It was just as good as the others.I think Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World was next on my list, but I never got around to it, because of that block. I had heard a bunch of good things about this book, so I was excited about it, but I couldn't take anymore lonely male protagonists taken on a mysterious ride where he himself didn't know what the mission was, but knew it involved a woman in his life disappearing, or some such variation on that theme.If I'd went ahead and read this book then, I might have liked it a lot, because it doesn't follow that mold as closely. It's the only one I've read with alternating chapters/storylines and it's the only one where things get weird from the very start instead of starting normal and slowly getting weirder.But I didn't read it then. I read it now, in 2010, and I feel like I've gotten over my Murakami phase. Many passages fell flat to my ears, especially the dialogue, perhaps because of the translation? Or maybe it was flat as well in the original language? Also, the conceit felt sci-fi in a bad way, like vague and unconvincing, (INKlings?) and everything revolved around twists and turns of the plot instead of character development. These characters didn't have any depth at all, or were totally unbelievable (a 17 year old who wears all pink all the time, down to her undies?) or had totally inexplicable motivations for their actions, and even the narrator didn't feel real to me even though I'm in his head reading his thoughts.On the positive side, there were some ideas that were interesting to me. Like this one (please try to ignore the professor's phony accent...that's not the "positive part" I'm trying to show):"The encyclopedia wand's a theoretical puzzle, like Zeno's paradox. The idea is t'engrave the entire encyclopedia onto a single toothpick. Know how you do it?""You tell me.""You take your information, your encyclopedia text, and you transpose it into numerics. You assign everything a two-digit number, periods and commas included. 00 is a blank, A is 01, B is 02, and so on. Then after you've lined them all up, you put a decimal point before the whole lot. So now you've got a very long sub-decimal fraction. 0.173000631... Next, you engrave a mark at exactly that point along the toothpick. If 0.50000's your exact middle on the toothpick, then 0.3333's got t'be a third of the way from the tip. You follow?""Sure.""That's how you can fit data of any length in a single point on a toothpick. Only theoretically, of course. No existin' technology can actually engrave so fine a point. But this should give you a perspective on what tautologies are like. Say time's the length of your toothpick. The amount of information you can pack into it doesn't have anything t'do with the length. Make the fraction as long as you want. It'll be finite, but pretty near eternal. Though if you make it a repeatin' decimal, why, then it is eternal. You understand what that means? The problem's the software, no relation to the hardware. It could be a toothpick or a two-hundred-meter timber or the equator - doesn't matter. Your body dies, your consciousness passes away, but your thought is caught in the one tautological point an instant before, subdividin' for an eternity. Think about the koan: An arrow is stopped in flight. Well, the death of the body is the flight of the arrow. It's makin' a straight line for the brain. No dodgin' it, not for anyone. People have t'die, the body has t'fall. Time is hurlin' that arrow forward. And yet, like I was sayin', thought goes on subdividin' that time for ever and ever. The paradox becomes real. The arrow never hits.""In other words," I said, "immortality.""There you are. Humans are immortal in their thought. Though strictly speakin', not immortal, but endlessly, asymptotically close to immortal. That's eternal life."Towards the middle of this book, I was convinced that there would be a plot twist at the end where you would find out that the "real" world was the End of the World and the "world in his head" would actually be the one where the professor and the chubby girl lived. This ending never came to pass (I'm thankful, cause I hate guessing endings correctly), but reading another reviewer (Eccentric Muse), I realized a related and cogent point: the unicorn world was written in a much more believable way than the sci-fi tokyo supposedly real world. If this was a conscious decision on Murakami's part, he wasn't able to pull it together to make it look intentional. Instead, it just felt like some really bad writing. What gives?
