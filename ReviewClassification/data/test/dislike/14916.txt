Honestly, the only thing I enjoyed about this book was that it was an easy read, which made the process of finishing it quick and slightly less painful. Only slightly, though, because this book was pretty much a waste of my time. I got nothing out of this story whatsoever. Novalee is the least inspiring protagonist I've ever had to follow, and the breaks to Willy Jack's story line came as a relief, despite the fact that he's meant to be a secondary character.I don't understand the choice to make this book first person; sure, it would be weird to switch between Novalee and Willy Jack's perspective if it was in first, but for the purpose of the novel I think third person was ineffective. The audience is supposed to be following Novalee on an emotional journey, and yet Novalee doesn't seem to react to anything for more than a paragraph. It's as if groundbreaking moments have little effect on her, which I found to be incredibly annoying.The plot development in this novel was sporadic at best, moving slowly for some chapters and then jumping ahead two months for the next. It was inconsistent and I think it hindered the flow of the novel. I found myself struggling to envision how Novalee managed to get from point A to point B way too often, and honestly it seems like the author skipped these parts simply so she wouldn't have to provide an explanation (for example, the two months after Americus is born isn't even touched on, and details on how Novalee settled in to Walmart, how she felt about the press going after her, and Mama Nell's betrayal are left out).Overall, this book was a disappointment. I don't know what Oprah was on about when she recommended it.
