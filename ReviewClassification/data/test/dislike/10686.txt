In hindsight, I feel I was too kind with this book, it makes far more sense simply to describe it as evil.It encourages victim blaming - since they only have themselves to blame for bringing their fates upon themselves for a lack of positiver thinking, and ultimately encourages the reader to blame themselves since when their wishes fail to become fishes there can only be one reason - the positive thinking wasn't quite positive enough, or didn't have quite the perfect tone of positivity to it. And in typical dreariness it discourages through its victim blaming an understanding of yourself or of the structural disadvantages that you may contribute towards in your society though acts of commission or omission that keep the less fortunate always on the back foot.Perhaps the most worthwhile comment I can make aboutThe Secretis that it is fascinating as a cultural document(view spoiler)[ Barbara EhrenreichSmile or Die How Positive Thinking Fooled America and the Worldis very interesting on the wider phenomenon of positive thinking(hide spoiler)]. It is a book that provides an insight to the preoccupations and fears of one of the wealthiest, healthiest and long-lived societies in human history. What it evidences is an obsession with gaining even more money, having even better health, and appearing eternally youthful(view spoiler)[just likeThe Portrait of Dorian Grey(hide spoiler)]. Dressed in the language of Quantum physics(view spoiler)[fans of magical thinking seem to like mentioning Quantum physics I suppose because down at the quantum level things appear to be far weirder that we'd like to imagine - things can be in two different places at the same time, or have energy but no mass. At the same time I imagine the author assumes that quantum physicists are unlikely to read her book, criticise it publicly and even if they do, probably not in the kind of places that her other readers may come across it(hide spoiler)]there is an appeal to magical thinking. InThe SecretGod may or may not be dead, however the universe is benevolent, but stupid(view spoiler)[ the universe although capable of understanding human thought does so in a limited way understanding 'I don't want debt' and 'I want debt' to mean one and the same thing, maybe this is a hang over from Neuro-Linguistic Programming?(hide spoiler)], and functions as an infinite catalogue for the pleasure and delight of all people who can order up whatever they want from existence by simply wishing for it. However there is a catch. You have to wish for things properly, by wishing only once and visualising(view spoiler)[As with quantum physics, the concepts of visualisation and the Placebo effect are invoked to demonstrate the power of the mind. This is part of the way thatThe Secretfunctions, a stepping stone with a familiar name leads to the bizarre conclusion that the universe is a giant, friendly, mail order catalogue(hide spoiler)]what you want precisely. If you haven't got anything back from the universe this is because you plainly haven't been wishing in the proper manner.It would be strikingly ungenerous of me to say that there is nothing of value at all inThe Secret, but making much of what value there may be would be rather like pulling out a cherry from a bowl full of cockroaches. It can be done, but you wouldn't want to eat the it even if you did. This is not then a book whose contents I endorse or advise any one to take personally(view spoiler)[ not that I have anything against thinking nice thoughts, cultivating a feeling of gratitude and so on as ends in themselves, simply as a mechanistic means to material ends(hide spoiler)].The general idea is that you wish for something, visualise it. Then the frequency you emit at the quantum level(view spoiler)[I don't know whether we emit frequencies at the quantum level, and if we did what would the implications be of changing it, they would be presumably considerably weirder than what Byrne imagines(hide spoiler)]changes, the universe then responds to that frequency. If the frequency we emit is one of mega wealth, huge houses and soul mates then that's what we get from the universe. While if it is of sinking ships, world financial disasters or war then that is what we gets back.Perhaps you feel doubtful about all this - but fear not for here come some celebrity endorsements! According to Byrne all these people taught the same message:poets such as William Shakespeare, Robert Browning, and William Blake delivered it in their poetry. Musicians such as Ludwig van Beethoven(view spoiler)[Famous for his ability to attract soul mates to himself(hide spoiler)]expressed it through their music. Artists such as Leonardo da Vinci depicted it in their paintings(view spoiler)[How else but through the power of the mind did the Lady get an Ermine?(hide spoiler)]. Great thinkers including Socrates, Plato, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Pythagoras, Sir Francis Bacon, Sir Isaac Newton, Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, and Victor Hugo shared it in their writings and teachings...(p4). There's nothing like a celebrity endorsement. Particularly when the celebrity is too dead to take issue with it.Later on we are told that Andrew Carneige, Abraham Lincoln and Henry Ford also all knew and practisedThe Secret(view spoiler)[ I don't know, presumably Abraham Lincoln successfully visualised the American Civil War into existence or something, and when people mention Henry Ford in this kind of context you can be pretty sure they are not thinking of his determination to set up a rubber plantation, insisting on having the rubber trees planted so close together that parasites infested the whole lot. Carneige though was successful in encouraging US Presidents to visualise a fine new fleet of battleships with the extra thick armour plating that only his steelworks could manufacture(hide spoiler)]. But I find the mention of Goethe particularly interesting since his Faust and what Byrne is presenting is a similar kind of fairy tale. Except that in the folk tale tradition the three wishes, the genie out of the bottle, or the pact with the Devil, all come with a sting in the tale. For Byrne the sting is ignored and instead we get a pure dose of wish fulfilment. Midias and his golden touch would be seen as something positive and not as frightening, alienating and eventually potentially fatal as it was.Still, there is a sting. Firstly you have to be perpetually positive(view spoiler)[ and that's just exhausting to think about(hide spoiler)], then you have to not listen to anybody who is still than positive for fear of your thoughts being infected by theirs and thus attracting some negative outcome to yourself(view spoiler)[ so I'd say that friendship, sympathy and family relations are out, you need to surround yourself with true believers in(hide spoiler)]. Finally if you accept that you are in control of your fate and the nature of your existence by means of being able to change the world through your wish power, then it follows that all other people can do the same and have only themselves to blame for every way that their lives are less than perfect, and ultimately if you have debt, only a bare hovel to live in, are sick, or even age, then you only have yourself to blame.This is a belief that embraces the alienating effect of modern life as its centre piece. You are alone, you can't help others, you should not even listen to them. Instead you are to focus intently on your own desires. There is no room inThe Secretfor collective organisation and action. No families, no joint partnerships, no professional organisations or unions to deal with the problems and difficulties that we experience in our lives. Instead there is only the atomised individual. In place of the concrete joys of conviviality and relationships with actual people there is an abstract relationship with the universe which as mentioned above has a limited understanding of language and functions purely as an unlimited catalogue."Everything that surrounds you right now in your life, including the things you're complaining about, you've attracted"...Often when people first hear this part of the Secret they recall events in history where masses of lives were lost, and they find it incomprehensible that so many people could have attracted themselves to the event(view spoiler)[ if there is a Hebrew edition published in Israel is this sentence removed? The idea doesn't strike me as incomprehensible so much as repulsive(view spoiler)[but I do appreciate that she wasn't coy about her opinion and just came straight out with it(hide spoiler)].(hide spoiler)]. By the law of attraction, they had to be on the same frequency as the event. It doesn't necessarily mean they thought of that exact event, but the frequency of their thoughts matched the frequency of the event. If people believe they can be in the wrong place at the wrong time, and they have no control over outside circumstances, those thoughts of fear, separation, and powerlessness, if persistent, can attract them to being in the wrong place at the wrong time...You have a choice, and whatever you choose to think will become your life experience.Nothing can come into your experience unless you summon it though persistent thoughts.pp27-28If you are complaining, the law of attraction will powerfully bring into your life more situations for you to complain about. If you are listening to some one else complain and focusing on that, sympathizing with them, agreeing with them, in that moment, you are attracting more situations to yourself to complain aboutp17I find the mention ofevents in history where masses of lives were losta fascinating example of victim blaming - particularly in the context of Australian and American history. In the nineteenth century commentators took the view that aboriginal peoples would die out because of their inherent inferiority and ability to cope with the modern world(view spoiler)[ as opposed to the violence, warfare, and ecological disruption going on at the time(hide spoiler)]. Now when their populations have been much reduced we can blame that on their inability to think happy positive thoughts. This is a book that works to re-enforce the existing status quo. Those who are successful can only be so for their ability to think positive thought and attract good things to themselves, while those who are not successful are the victims of their own inability to properly visualise what they want as opposed to having face some structural disadvantage in the way that society is ordered.One can see here how this approach makes life easy in a way. One doesn't have to understand or appreciate the world and the circumstances of other's lives. One can straight away be judgemental: they brought it on themselves, whether it is cancer, war, contagious disease, or bad architecture.(view spoiler)[ But of course the something like the boom in London property prices or the Wall street crash and subsequent Great Depression do indeed demonstrate the power of positive thinking. The first could be nothing other than millions of people thinking positive thoughts in concentric rings and the other was the result of millions of people thinking negative thoughts - and what a hero Herbert Hoover was in his one man attempt to try and turn round the thought patterns of a nation by telling everybody that the economy was on the turn.(hide spoiler)]Victim blaming fits well withThe Secret's role as a cultural document. Although it does seem to refine the concept. The good news is that if I punch you it is your fault. I am innocent, you attracted that punch to yourself through your lack of positive thoughts. Indeed it I seize you, carry you off to a offshore enclave, hold you in captivity for over ten years, torture you from time to time, without any legal process this is also something you attracted to yourself through negative thoughts and quite rightly I will be well paid for doing so because I think only positive, nice, thoughts and therefore attract as a modern Midas glittering palaces, big cars and multiple soul mates to myself(view spoiler)[ I find the business of soul mates interesting, does the soul mate you draw to yourself have no agency or independent will? In the world of the secret a soul mate is the equivalent of a big house or a pile of banknotes. Its simply another acquisition rather as one might buy a Ken doll to sit alongside Barbie in her dream car(hide spoiler)].It strikes me thatThe Secretwill appeal to people who are intimidated by evidence of the world's complexity and feel out of control.The Secretsays very firmly that you can, indeed should be, in control. However since sickness, old age and death exist wouldn't belief in this book give rise to anxiety(view spoiler)[ reading this book sparked off memories of those Calvinists anxious over whether they were part of the elect or not - are you wishing correctly or are you allowing negative thoughts to leak into your consciousness causing disaster throughout your life!(hide spoiler)]? Every time you have a cold or find a grey hair you are confronted with evidence of your own inability to think insufficiently positively!You don't have to mad to live this life, but if you are...In a newspaper article I read a journalist interviewed the psychologist who wrote the second report on Anders Brevik - the one which found him sane. In response to the journalist's question about how appropriate his finding was the psychologist responded that hundreds of people have written to Brevik in prison all praising him for his actions - are they all insane too, he asked rhetorically.My response would be yes. But then perhaps to be sane in the world would be the most insane reaction one could have(view spoiler)[there was a nice short story I once read about a psychiatrist returning to his home town after a distinguished career in Europe to open an insane asylum. As the story progresses he finds grounds to incarcerate more and more of the town's population in his asylum until everybody has been finally committed. Then he realises that what he has done is also completely insane so he has himself locked up to. And then everybody lives happily ever after(view spoiler)[ the story isO Alienistaby Machado de Assis(hide spoiler)](hide spoiler)]. We don't for the most part notice the amount of insanity around us because on the whole it doesn't cause that much friction. It's only in books likeThe Secretthat the inner craziness of people's private lives gets laid out in public:The law of attraction states that what you focus on you will get, so I got a bank statement, I whited out the total, and I put a new total in there. I put exactly how much I wanted to see in the bank(p104)A game I created that help shift my feelings about my pile of bills was to pretend that the bills were actually checks. I would jump for joy as I opened them and say, "more money for me! Thank you. Thank you." I took each bill, imagined it was a check, and then I added a zero to it in my mind to make it even more. I got a notepad and wrote at the top of each page "I have received," and then I would list all the amounts of the bills with an added zero. Next to each amount I would write "Thank you," and feel the feelings of gratitude for receiving it - to the point where I had tears in my eyes. Then I would take each bill, which looked very small compared to what I had received, and I would pay it with gratitude!(p105)Still my favourite part of this book is a fine example of how irrational the rational world of business can be.The true story of a Belize oil team is an inspiring example of the power of the human mind to bring forth resources(view spoiler)[What quantum physicists and Einstein tell us is that everything is happening simultaneously...whatever you want in the future already exists(p62) it seems that Byrne believes this applies to the past too - that through positive thinking the team altered the geological processes that occurred in the region. This probably also explains why Howard Carter discovered Tutankhamun's burial to be so rich(hide spoiler)]The directors of Belize Natural Energy Limited were trained by the eminent Dr. Tony Quinn, who specialises in Humanistic Physiology training. With Dr. Quinn's mind power training, the directors were confident that their mental picture of Belize being a successful oil producing country would be achieved...and in one short year their dream and vision became a reality. Belize Natural Energy Limited discovered oil of the highest quality, in abundant flows...Belize has become an oil-producing country because an extraordinary team of people believed in the unlimited power of their mind.Nothing is unlimited-not resources or anything else. It is only limited in the human mind...(pp148-9)Oil production in Belize took off in late 2006, peaked in 2010 and remains in steady decline.Probably not my final thoughtsIf the idea of the universe as a complex place that requires understanding makes you uncomfortable, if the idea of bad things happening to good people is a problem for you, then books likeThe Secrethold the solution. It's offer is that life is simple. Everybody gets exactly what they are due to get, everything works fine just as it is, and you can be in control.This could be a reassuring message for some, particularly since it relives you of the exhausting work of having to appreciate the world, all its interactions and how we are all implicated and bound up with one another - allowing you to get on with the business of being judgemental instead.It doesn't work for me because it requires a pretty contorted view on existence as far as I can tell and its focus on material goods leaves me cold. It also doesn't just recommend ignoring a good chunk of the normal experience of human life but recommends vigorous self censorship to achieve a kind of cargo cult effect - only through the thorough imitation of the assumed thought habits of the rich and famous can one achieve the unlimited power to alter the geology of Belize.I'm left with the odd feeling that the author readFoucault's Pendulumand thought that those guys were really on to something with "The Plan".Is it is surprise that our society throws up a book likeThe Secretfrom time to time, and it is apt that it appeared on the eve of a financial crash, a clear and vigorous trumpet blast at odds with complex and shifting reality.
