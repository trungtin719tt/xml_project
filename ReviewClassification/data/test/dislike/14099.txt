If I read "naw" one more time, I'm gonna have to slap a bitch. That has to be, to me, the least intelligent-sounding word to come out of anyone's mouth--doubly so if you're answering your own rhetorical questions, Anita, as though the reader is too stupid to realize that no, the vampire probably won't let you go.Anita's a stone cold bitch; in all three hundred pages I think the only real concern she had was for a character we barely met whose name I've forgotten. (In fact, this review had one star, but just remembering this fact made me remove it. No stars for you, Anita.) I get the feeling that Anita's just in this job to kill vampires legally. Her entire feeling towards vampires seems to be summed up as "I hate them all and want to kill them but I guess Jean-Claude's OK because he's kinda cute."I wanted more, lots more, of Edward. He was the most interesting character in the book, and he was clearly a sociopathic killer with no real emotions or empathy. When that's the best character in a story, something's gone wrong in putting him in a sidekick role.Half this book could have been eliminated if clothing and gun details had been removed. Every chapter seemed to have a lengthy description of just what Anita was wearing to hide her super cool, heavily detailed guns and knives. I only need to know once that she's wearing something that will cover her weapons and it's gonna be hot because of it. Briefly mention how the guns are special and then just call it "the gun." I don't care to begin with and I won't care the third time you reference a gun I've never heard of.I'm still amazed that I read three hundred pages and not once was there any explanation of the vampire myths; the most we got to explaining how any of these creatures came to be was a vague "no one really knows" for the ghouls that was poorly explained later in a way that was supposed to be definitive but never actually explained anything. Three hundred pages in a world where vampires are possibly getting the right to vote and you're not going to explain where the heck they came from? That's a severe lack of detail. I wanted to know how vampires came to be, why they have a pulse and can bleed, what exactly is going on with the mind connection and "four bites"; all these things are so drastically different from any other vampire myths that they need to be explained. All Anita's concerned with is killing them--some expert; if she does know anything about vampires (and all she seems to know is how to murder them), she doesn't bother to let anyone know. I get the feeling she knows just enough to hate and that's all she wants to know. Her loathing for the Church of Eternal Life was palpable and insulting; her attitude there as well as elsewhere seemed to be "How dare people be different from me? They should all die, the monsters."This book needed less of Anita's bigotry and demeaning attitude and more explanation of vampire origins and how they came from feared monsters to nearly getting the vote.
