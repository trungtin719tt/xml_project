Video full series review (spoiler free)-https://youtu.be/V3TuI9iCvoUUpdate 2/11/17- After reading the second book and having more time to sit on it, I'm lowering my rating of this one from 3 stars to 2.5 stars. The sequel was fine, but this first book was a rough start and was a mostly negative experience for me.Original 2/6/17-I wrote some harsh things about this book on Twitter and in earlier reading updates about how it was offensive, so I want to address that. This book is a dystopia, which I didn't realize going in. In some respects, it is intentionally offensive. A terrible society is set up that you are supposed to hate and want to be overthrown.I never know what people consider to be spoilers so I'm hiding some of the following points. Open if you want to know more.Race-(view spoiler)[Race is something that was handled questionably. The society in this book is monoethnic. They are described as having darker, olive toned skin and dark hair and eyes. When the main character Amy is introduced with her pale skin, red hair, and green eyes, the other character Elder immediately sees her as more beautiful than anyone else. I felt that this reinforced white beauty standards. If the races had been changed, however, it may have also reinforced exoticism (though I'm not the right person to ask on that)."She is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen, but also the strangest. Her skin is pale, almost translucent white, and I don't think it's just from the ice. [...] How can this girl fit into the monoethnic no-differences-at-all world Eldest says provides perfect peace?" - p57I think it was just an unfortunate situation that the book wrote itself into. The main point the book is trying to make is that our differences should be celebrated and there is a line in the last half about identity being tied to race, so by trying to erase race the leaders of this society were erasing what makes humanity so beautiful."He has no concept that a race is part of a person's identity - he just sees it as a difference, a difference that's better off eliminated." p306Ultimately, I can appreciate the point the book was making by showing race erasure as a flaw in the society, but I think it was done a bit clumsily.(hide spoiler)]Mental Illness-(view spoiler)[Another part I didn't like was the handling of mental illness. There is a mental ward on the ship and every time it was mentioned, I was uncomfortable. Again, the way it was portrayed did have a reason in the end. You are supposed to dislike it. However, there were some truly awful stereotypes used in regards to mental illness that are not ok, and did not need to be included to make the point the book was trying to make. Every character in the mental ward is called a creative type. They are painters, writers, poets. This reinforces the stereotype that mental illness equals creativity, or vice versa. There was also a line that equated being organized with having OCD."The doctor starts straightening the pencils I dumped on his desk. He's seriously OCD." p109While other aspects of how mental illness were treated were challenged, these 2 things were not, perpetuating harmful stereotypes.(hide spoiler)]Possessive relationship &amp; male gaze-(view spoiler)[This is the part of the story I ended up hating the most. Sure, Elder is a product of his flawed society, but there is no way I am excusing his actions enough to ship this. The first time Elder sees Amy, she's naked and unconscious and he spends several lines describing her breasts and saying how he can't look away from them."My eyes devour her body, then drift back to her breasts. The ice is a little foggy there, teasing me, but I can see enough to know they're lush, and even if they're frozen, I imagine that if they were warmed up..." (character's thoughts are cut off) p57Many times in the book they are interacting and he has internal thoughts of grabbing her or slamming her against walls to crush her lips with his."Amy bites her lip, and all I want to do is seize her, crush her against me, feel her lips with mine." p173His thoughts are very sexual and aggressive in tone. He isn't aggressive with her in action, but he is very jealous of other males talking to her, and acts generally possessive towards her. Because he is the only male on the ship her age, Amy just kind of goes with it. I cannot, will not, get behind this ship. She has no choice. (To be fair, Amy brings up this very point about choice at the start of book 2.)(hide spoiler)]Sexual assault- I felt it was also worth mentioning that there is a scene of attempted rape in the book for anyone who needs a heads up. I can see how it serves to make a point about the society, but I hated reading it.In short, the society in this book is pretty offensive, but I can see now that it is intentionally that way in order to make its point. I think that if I had known this book was a dystopia rather than a space adventure, I probably would have realized earlier that of course the society would be awful and I wouldn't have reacted so negatively at first. Though, some of the things were just plain offensive without excuse. Basically what I'm saying is: it's bad, but not as bad as I initially thought.As for my enjoyment of the story, I thought a couple of the plot twists were super obvious, and I really didn't enjoy reading about this society (though as I've said, you aren't supposed to enjoy it). The characters both seemed very childish in the way they spoke, although I listened to the audiobook and that very well could have been due to the way the narrators read it (book 2 has different voice actors and has a totally different feel). By the end I did decide to pick up the next book, mainly just because I'm trying to read some of Beth Revis's work and this series is the most easily available one to me on OverDrive.
