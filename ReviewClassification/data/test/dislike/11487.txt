I can't believe I am giving a Le Guin book 2 stars, I have nothing but respect for this writer and her work, but alas,A Wizard of Earthseawas a chore to get through.Frankly, I only enjoyed the very beginning and the very end of this story. What's in between is excruciatingly boring.A Wizard of Earthseais an introspective book. What I mean is, it's all about one wizard's personal quest to overcome the dark entity - Shadow - that he unleashed during a youthful boasting about his magical powers. Ged spends the majority of the novel feeling ashamed of his deed, or running away from the Shadow or, in the end, finally confronting it.It is not a bad tale on the intellectual level, that's why the book has such a strong following. But as a reading experience it was underwhelming. There are no interesting personalities or relationships in this book, no adventures. Just a very, very dry, almost didactic, quest. I look back at some science fiction works of Le Guin's -Four Ways to ForgivenessorThe Left Hand of Darkness- they blew my mind.A Wizard of Earthseajust didn't.Listening to this novel as read byHarlan Ellisonwas an experience in its own. This person really overdid it, emphasizing stuff and yelling and stammering every other sentence. None if which was in the novel. At times I could almost feel him spitting during the reading. But in the end, this narrator did the job for me. When I tried finishing the novel on my own, I was bored to death, so only thanks to him I was able to get to the finish line at all.The lesson here, I guess, is that I should stay away fromUrsula K. Le Guin's fantasy, which I will gladly do.
