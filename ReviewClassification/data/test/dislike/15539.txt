Sorry to say this one was really disappointing. I think Charlaine Harris' writing has come a long way since the start of this series, but I think Dead and Gone is a considerable step backwards, and really has me thinking this series should be given an honourable end...meaning sooner than later.Obviously there's at least one more book coming in the series. Sadly, I'll be hoping for one last reasonable attempt, rather than waiting with great anticipation as I have for some of the previous books.
