So does Cremer like Harry Potter? SeamusFinniganDoran. That Neville dude from one of the wolf packs. How dare she use their names in her book?Just for that I'm going to use the epic dating site serial killer memes for you, Cremer. That's the theme for this review.Stupid, wacko loser of an author. What is your problem? Do you not understand the annoying traits of insta-love? Do you not learn from other young adult paranormal romance writers that demonstrate that horrid concept of "love"? Must I remind every author out there? Cremer, the next time you write a book, remember that. Nonsense.And what is with your heroine? Why does she hate everyone except SeamusFinniganDoran? What's gotten into her? She's almost as whiny and pessimistic as the Queen of whinyness and pessimism, Bella Swan. Whatshername anyway? The heroine? Ah, yes. Calla Tor.And that guy that lusts after her? What's his problem? He's so dirty and disgusting. He makes me cringe. Whatshisname anyway? That guy? Ah, yes. Ren Laroche.The cover was so splendidly gorgeous! Why? Why must the nicest covers have the crappiest insides? I'm leaving.Andrea Cremer, can I say something to you?Yes, I've seen your new haircut. And I loved it.
