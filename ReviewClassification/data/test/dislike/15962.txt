Southport, North Carolina sets the stage for this book. Katie is running from a bad relationship right into the arms of Alex, the local store owner who has two adorable kids and is a widower. As with most predictable love stories by Mr. Sparks the bad relationship catches up to the good one-- this one ending with a massive firestorm and a unrealistic twist that doesn't quite make the heart strings pull. I found this one overly wrought with scenes that would never happen in real life, and the ending made me roll my eyes so hard I almost had to close the book before it was over.
