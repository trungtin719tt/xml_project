If you had read the first three books of the Hush, Hush series, you will know the author, Becca Fitzpatrick, has nothing new to offer; she did nothing to redeem her creation, she made no attempt to make anything in her story better.review for book 3 here:https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1...In short, it's one hell of an uninspiring, boring, dull book, stuffed with bad YA romance, Mary Sue heroine, cardboard cutout sexy bad boy love interest, villains who are as badly written as the good guys, charmless and toneless *utterly boring* writing, and nonexistent tension and suspense. In fact this book is just so dull, its characters so utterly stupid and unrealistic (but they think they're all so smart and complicated!) to a point I find it difficult to write a proper review about it.In other news, this final book demonstrates Ms. Fitzpatrick knows not a damn thing about world building, about writing battle scenes, writing characters with personalities and depth. Plus it also demonstrates she cannot handle writing anything with a slightly more complicated angles than a simple cliched love triangle and stupid teenage dramas, that's it.One more thing, I find it really stupid for the male lead (an angel who has been around for unmemorable time) to act like a horny teenager all the time. It's also stupid for fallen angels to travel from one place to another by *driving in cars*.And it's super stupid for the heroine, Nora Grey to care more about whether her boyfriend is cheating on her or not than about a war which is going on around her and her people. *sighs*
