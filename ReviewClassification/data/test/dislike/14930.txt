Another good installment in the Sookie Stackhouse series.I enjoyed the story, once again, but I was disappointed by one thing, which has sort of been bothering me since the 1st book in the series. It seems to me that at times Charlaine Harris isn't able to keep her details straight. Granted, she has written A LOT and I can certainly understand confusing the details in that situation, but surely any decent editor would have caught these types of discrepancies...For example:- (Book 1) Fang-bangers became fangbangers. (This isn't a huge issue, but the hyphen was used originally, and therefore should be afterwards.)- (Books 1-5) Kevin Prior turned into Kevin Pryor, and then back to Prior, and then back again to Pryor.- Jason's boss is Shirley (Catfish)Hennesseyin Book 4, but in Book 5, all of a sudden he's Shirley (Catfish)Hunter. What?!?This is kind of a pet-peeve of mine. It's a petty thing, I know, but it is annoying. In my opinion, Harris has created a world of detail in these books, and it seriously detracts from the enjoyment of the story when those details change from book to book in the series.I wish that Sookie would stop being so friggin' unreasonable when it comes to disagreements. If she would just hear someone out one day rather than storming off in a huff, she might be better off!
