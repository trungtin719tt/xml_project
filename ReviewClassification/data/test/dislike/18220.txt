ICK.I borrowed this book from a friend while on vacation, because I was DESPERATE. She promised it was amazing.It was not.I did not like Taylor. Denise was a flagrant Mary Sue (did the woman have a single flaw?). Melissa and Mitch's main functions were to push Taylor towards (or back to) Denise. The writing was flat - it seemed rushed, and watered down.A friend who is a speech therapist had some very critical things to say about the "therapy" presented in the book. I defer to her opinion on the matter for the most part, since she is the expert. Speaking for myself, I did not find the therapy methods Denise used very convincing. It seemed as though what she was doing was just inducing Kyle to copy her, instead of teaching him. I can't see that strapping a child in a chair for HOURS AND HOURS would be helpful, either. It seems torturous. For a half hour? Sure. For an hour? Okay. For 8 hours? (as described by Mr. Sparks in his Author's Note) no way. All that would teach a child (it seems to me) is that learning = pain, or at the least, discomfort.Next time I'm that desperate for reading material I'll read the back of my shampoo bottle instead.
