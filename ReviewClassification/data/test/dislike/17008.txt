Birdsong? More like Birdshit. I may have given this book one star, but I really give it 20 piles of steaming birdshit.I can't even contain the hatred I feel for this one. It's just horrible. Everything and I mean everything about it, is just horrible.It starts off as a supposed love story between a young Englishman Stephen Wraysford and some French harlot named Isabelle. But it's not a love story, it's a fuck story that includes bastard children, betrayal and whole lot of boring WWI shit thrown in.After skimming through it just to finish it, my reaction was so strong that I threw it across the room and scared the shit out of my cats.
