I don't want this to come across like I'm desensitized to drugs and how they can screw up someone's life, because I've personally seen that happen to many times to ever underestimate the power of addiction. And while I think it's important that YA authors write about these topics in an honest and eye-opening way, I don't think that Hopkins did that, even though her story is based on first-hand experience with meth. I felt that much of her writing was cliche, in terms of language and description. I felt that her characters fell into stereotypical patterns (and could Chase's "dialogue" have been any cheesier?) The form does add some appeal to the novel, though again, I've seen that done before and done much better. Some of these issues, I think, are because of the form's limits (it's hard to develop secondary characters at all when you're writing first person poetry), but others are just limitations of the story itself. I think that there was a lot going on with Kristina that wasn't caused by the drugs -- sure, meth amplified those things, but there were other issues at the root of her bad choices and I thought the author really glossed over them (maybe because she wanted to be able to lay all these problems at the feet of the "monster" rather than take some responsibility herself? I'm not sure.)
