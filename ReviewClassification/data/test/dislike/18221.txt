I was so mad after I read this book I actually sat down and wrote a letter to the author. "Dr. Mr. Sparks: This is why I do not read fiction!" Basically I thought it was incredibly sappy and trite, and I resented the characters for wasting my time. Presumably all the main figures in the story are "rescued"--the little boy is lost and then rescued, the single mother meets the rescuer of her little boy and falls in love with him and marries him (I think that is supposed to be HER rescue!) and the main character (after failing to rescue his buddy from a burning building) is "rescued" by his wife and stepson and, of course, their new baby.I mean--what? Not my kind of book.Samuel Beckett could have had these characters sitting on folding chairs in the semi-darkness and we would understand more about them than Sparks' shows us in his whole narrative. The mother, the son, the fireman--they're stiff and cliched at every turn. Sparks' has a frustrating habit it seems, having also read Message In A Bottle, of substituting plot intrigue and drama for actual character development.
