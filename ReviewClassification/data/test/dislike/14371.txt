Nasty DrunkI'd heard multiple times that Bukowski was a shit to women, but a really good writer. OK, I can deal with that. I mean, I wouldn't want to have a drink with the guy but it's not like misogyny's a new one on me. Bring it on: I will read your stuff.I gave up about halfway through. Not because he was vile to women (he was vile to everyone) but because there was nothing, I meannothingto engage me.Sparse writing style is only a boon if you have something good to writeabout. This has the typical Beat directionless self-aggrandisement - listing every single nothing-much thing he does - but whereas someone like Kerouac had an infectious enthusiasm for life which carries you through, Bukowski just hates everything. He doesn't hate everything in an insightful or funny way, there's no life history to clue you in on why. He's just bitter. Really bitter.So: we have no plot, an unlikeable protagonist/narrator, and a stripped-down prose style which gets straight to the point. Except that the book completely lacks a point - so we just have threadbare descriptions of how much he hates his landlady, how many beers he's had, how little change is left in his pocket, how crap that blowjob was, etc.Maybe there's a meta-point going on about disaffection in the 20th century or something. But I've got better things to read.
