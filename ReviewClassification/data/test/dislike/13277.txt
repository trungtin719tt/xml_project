This was by far the worst experience I've ever had reading a John Green book. I really always enjoy his writing and humor, but this one just didn't do anything for me.I don't think the book was horrible, but it couldn't hold my attention too long so I was happy it was very short. If it was any longer I probably wouldn't have finished it. I couldn't stand Colin. He was annoying and whiny and just because he acknowledges that fact himself doesn't mean it makes it any less annoying to read about. His friend Hassan was alright. I didn't mind him and I thought he had some funny parts, but most of the humor with him was about his fatness and man boobs. That's not exactly my kind of humor, but I'm sure there are other people who love that kinda stuff. Lindsey wasn't that interesting either. She wasn't annoying like Colin, but I just found myself thinking they would hook up and that's it.To me this book was just bland. It didn't have any good twists or an engaging plot. Usually I feel lots of emotions when reading one of John's books, but with this one I felt nothing but boredom. He does include his signature road trip where the character learns some lessons about life, but getting that far was a struggle for me.I wouldn't recommend this book to someone who wants to try John Green, because I rate this so much lower than all of his other books. The writing style and formula is present, but it's just not as good.
