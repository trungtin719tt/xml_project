I honestly expected much more than this. It was utterly mediocre from the beginning to the unsatisfying ending. This series started off so good with the first book being amazing, but then the books kept deteriorating.Loving certain characters and then having them getting on your nerves is more annoying than I had ever imagined. Most characters of this book, even those I liked in the first and second one, now I just found plain annoying. Well, for starters, I find it annoying that they didn't even want to help out in saving the human race, I hope they're satisfied with where they ended up being.This book, felt like stalling. Honestly, minus some action scenes and the main storyline parts which where poor to the point of nonexistent, there wasn't anything of much importance. This book could have honestly been 50 pages long it wouldn't have made a difference.Having characters running around with a no-brainer explanation and making them pigheaded, it was just frustrating. Thomas, Minho, Newt, they were all fools although I felt bad for one of them in the end but it wouldn't have made a difference.The ending inspired a sense of doom, and it's one that is unpredictable, you can imagine a hundred different ways they could end up. Yes, oh yes, I came up with some nice ideas about hyenas creeping up on them, or dying by venomous spiders. Is my imagination running wild?The only reason I gave this 2 stars is because I enjoy immensely the way Dashner writes, with his quirky dialogues, snarky comments and all. I just wish this author would come up with more rich and original storylines, because he really could be great.Do I recommend this series? Well, the first one HELL YES, the second one HMM YES and the third one UGH NO. That about sums it up.For some dystopia fans this could work, it didn't for me much as I wanted to.
