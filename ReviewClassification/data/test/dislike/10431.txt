The first time I remember reading this I was leaning against a convenient wall, reading while waiting for a fencing class to begin, well actually for somebody to unlock the hall and cupboards. One of the instructors spotting the book opined that there would be a lot of sword fighting in there - but there is is not. A couple of suicides and the murder of Caesar and that's your lot, though if you were directing you could add a bit more, but unlike sayHamletit's no fight fest.It is delightfully balanced with (ahem, spoiler alert?) the death of Caesar just before the middle. Exit Hubris pursued by Nemesis. No it's not much about sword fighting more about persuasion, ambition, and the ideals that can lead us into disaster (cough, cough et tu Brutus). I wonder what the audience made of it in the last years of Queen Elizabeth, leave in power those who are in power? Murder resolves no political differences? There will always be work for gravediggers? Who knows. Perhaps best not to take the disposable pop culture of another era too seriously.ANTONYFriends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.The evil that men do lives after them;The good is oft interred with their bones;So let it be with Caesar. The noble BrutusHath told you Caesar was ambitious:If it were so, it was a grievous fault,And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--For Brutus is an honourable man;So are they all, all honourable men--Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.He was my friend, faithful and just to me:But Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.He hath brought many captives home to RomeWhose ransoms did the general coffers fill:Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And Brutus is an honourable man.You all did see that on the LupercalI thrice presented him a kingly crown,Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;And, sure, he is an honourable man.I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,But here I am to speak what I do know.You all did love him once, not without cause:What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,And I must pause till it come back to me.
