So many glowing reviews forThe Sea of Tranquility, yet, I DNFed at 50%.Why? Because:1. Nastya is a twit.2. Josh is a caricature3. Both sound virtually identical. At a point, I couldn't distinguish whose POV I just read. Josh and Nastya were the same character, IMO.4. Why should I care about their class schedules or which teacher was an idiot or the high school angst? I mean, who cares?5. Nastya is a twat and I felt zero empathy (sympathy) for her ordeal.6. Not enough plot. I respect all the 5-star reviews but, I simply don't get it.
