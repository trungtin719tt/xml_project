I give this one a couple of meager points for addressing the difficult subjectI realise I'm supposed to love my own child but actually I don't because frankly he's a weirdo and always with the backchat, if he fell in a cementmixer how much better would my life be, a lot, and would the world be any the worse, no.Doris Lessing addressed the topic also in her weedy novel The Fifth Child. It's a big taboo, and all that.For my money though, bypass these poor excuses and go straight to nettyflix or where you get your movies and rent IT'S ALIVE!This is a snappy underrated movie about a baby who is frankly unloveable because he tends to slaughter everyone within a 25 foot radius of himself. He's very difficult to get close to. Because he keeps scuttering away into the sewers.So Kevin, of whom we must speak, is this dweeby young sociopath and yes, there are such people, and we should talk about them, yes, that's true, but not - please - not like Lionel Shriver talks about them. Any more of those creepy overwrought letters and I would have been reaching for my Kalashnikov. They are like an overstuffed Edwardian drawing room with beautifully framed autopsy photographs hung all around and poisoned angelcake waiting for you on a plate on the reproduction Sheraton. It's all more than a little sicky. The writer of these letters which make up this novel needs her head shrunk too, as well as her jolly son. As do I for reading this hunk of chewy gristle.Frankly ridiculous 1970s movie : 1Much talked about big fat socially concerned novel : 0
