I guess I can now write this review since I've settled down from doing a victory lap around my house as a result of completing this steaming pile of hot garbage. Maybe before I totally slam the book, I should say what Ididlike but to be honest there was very little to like. The plot wasn't bad. The love story &amp; connection between Tengo &amp; Aomame was somewhat cute. I could roll with all this. What blows my mind is that Murakami felt he needed 900+ pages to drag this whole shebang out. The prose was so mundane and the narrative dragged on and on and on that it was difficult to accurately gauge the turning points and climax of the story. Oh, and let's not talk about the constant repetition and writing about wasting timewhilewastingmytime because I'm reading abouthimwriting about wasting time. Are you still with me?I enjoy mind-twisting and mind-bending elements in a novel but I need some sort of anchor to base these things on. Murakami introduces Sakigake, dohta, maza and the Little People yet he only explores the periphery of these concepts (especiallythe Little People! Murakami, please tell me who they are and what the deal is with them. Like seriously, I really want to know).So then the question is what did he use the 900+ pages for? Honestly, your guess is as good as mine because after this slugfest I remain completely and utterly bewildered. Things also happen in this novel just because. There is no explanation and very vague character development. Upon completion, I just felt I was left with nothing.Nothing.I've heard positive things about some of his other works but after this experience I cannot say when next I will be picking up another Murakami to read. It shall surely be awhile yet, if ever.ETA (on 24 January 2014 1:35AM Central European Time (CET)1. By some miracle this review has garnered a boatload of likes. Thank you good people.2. However, I must say I am tired of random people flocking over to the comment section to (loudly) voice their disagreement, question my reading choices, question why I finished the book and just generally be condescending. This is my review space. I read the book, didn't like it and expressed it all in a review. If you disagree and you loved it, that's absolutely fine. Use your own review space to worship it. Don't come to mine and be a nuisance.3. Goodreads, please introduce the option to lock the comment section of specific reviews for the love of God.ETA (on 10 February 2014 12:30AM Central European Time (CET)1. On January 31 2014 Goodreads honored my request and locked this review.2. I am grateful that Goodreads honored my request and even though I am aware of the setting that blocks non-friends from commenting on my reviews that still seems to me to be an extreme option. I'm not averse to non-friends commenting on my reviews. I would just like the option to lock certain reviews to prevent them from descending into an unnecessary bitch fest from non-friends like this one did prior to the lock.
