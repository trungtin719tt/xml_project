I hate when this happens. I see it all the time.Great writer writes book. Book gets discovered, gets really famous. Writer makes a billion copies of said book in deteriorating quality.Rick Riordan should've stuck to his Percy Jackson series and his sister-series to that. Instead, I can see the dollar-signs in his eyes and the mocking "cha-ching!" in the background, and here we have the Kane Chronicles.Part of the reason I enjoyed The Lightning Thief so much is because the insight and dialogue were very true to a teenage boy. Awkward, confused, and with the emotional range of a teaspoon, yet he still had the depth of a good and likable character.The Red Pyramid switches dialogue between a sister and brother, Sadie and Carter, in which he drops the awkward dialogue, picking up a sort of vague, non-specific voice for both of the characters.I hate switching POVs unless it's done VERY well, and the problem is, most people who are good at creating voices don't switch. Because they're smart, unlike these sorry souls.And if you're going to feel the need to switch POVs, have some sort of difference between the two, ESPECIALLY if you're going to mention how unlike the two characters are every bloody second. If they're so different, how do they have the exact same dull voice?Also, I found the characters themselves dull, just like their vocal counterparts. Sadie had no depth at all- she just acted bored, snarky or confused and helpless. While the Lightning Thief's characters might have been slightly cliche, that's something I could get past. I just snoozed through the whole book. Carter was pretty much as bad.The plot was already used; I liked the whole son-needs-to-save-mom thing in the Lightning Thief, but you can't just use it twice! Also, in The Lightning Thief, Riordan spent time nurturing and explaining the relationship between Percy and his mom, so you actually cared when she got captured. Honestly, I didn't give a flying ankh whether Mr. Kane lived or died. Frankly, by the endIwanted to be crushed by a Rosetta Stone. Plus, as they explained so well, Sadie didn't even know her dad.The plot itself was used and meaningless, and the characters bored me to tears. And there was no Leo Valdez or random minor god to crack me up either, I mean seriously. Go do yourself a favor and buy Les Miserables, it's funnier.
