I hate, hate, HATED this book.*****SPOILER*****Pro (there's only one): Raphiem becomes a full human. Awesome.Cons: Almost everything else about the book. It felt like space filler. Why release this thing? It doesn't advance the story at all, it barely gives us anything new, it's basically a collection of instances in which Zoey and Stark are naked and Stark gets taken over by Kelona (big surprise there, since Stark has a piece of Kelona's soul). Oh, and Jack Dies. While singing a Glee song. Glee, really? I know you are trying to keep things current, but some how this really made the story seem less realistic than more (not that its realistic at all, with Vampires in it).When I first started reading this series, I thought it was some what interesting, nothing super exciting. Loved the two Bulls of Good and Evil, loved the Native American reference and Kelona as the bad guy with slightly redeeming factors, loved Raphiem, love the goddess.Hated that Heath was annoyingly stereotypical and forced, Zoey's stupid use of words like "bull-poopie" and her love of any soda "as long as it's brown", Eric's basically a Vampiric version of Heath, and the "twins" aspect thing was super annoying, do they have to call each other Twin? Do they , REALLY? We get it. They look nothing alike, ones white, ones black, but they share a brain, GOT IT. And Jack Twist. Jack Twist? Really? Come ON.
