***Cover Review***This is the cover?Are they serious?Every year the book cover for the series gets a little more unlikable.The Brown (eeew) clouds seems out of place.The girl looks so fake. Her shoulder blades are very disproportional to her torso.The hair looks filthy and her face looks creepy. Not the face that belongs to a heroine. It's not the face Daniel Gregory would fall for.If there's one thing that I liked about the cover it would be the lower half of it. Just starting from the word PASSION to the bottom. That's it, nothing else.It's an Emo art gone bad.But I know what they say about not judging the book by it's cover. I'm still excited for this book.
