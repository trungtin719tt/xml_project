There are numerous poems throughout this book by Robert Frost. The stories the poems create are simple and understandable. Even the longer poems that spread over a few pages are easy to get through if you want to.My favorite poem in the book is "Leaves compared with Flowers." It was memorable and I had once had it memorized. Works like these bring meaning to poems and cause me personally to want to read more.
