The book upon which my whole life is based...how could I not recommend it to everyone!!?!?It is challenging, and not intended for the reader looking to conduct an exercise in literary critique (although I would stand by it in such a test), but meant to provide the means by which you can find truth--about God, about this life, and about yourself. Not only is it straight forward, it also contains much deeper knowledge that you cannont gain anywhere else. This is what allows me to not follow blindly, but to be guided and lead in light and truth.
