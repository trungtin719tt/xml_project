Sigh. I don't know how to write a review for this book without it sounding like a full-out rant. So I guess I'll just rant.First of all, I will admit that I only have myself to blame for picking up this (audio)book. I wasn't a fan of the first one, and yet I still decided to giveThe Scorch Trialsa try. Somehow, this one was worse than theThe Maze Runner. How so? Let me count the ways...1. Character development.James Dashner deserves an award for achieving the impossible by being the first author to establishnegativecharacter development. I cared even less about the main characters than I did in the first book. Everyone started to blend together and there was no one character with any distinguishing features. Thomas/Minho/Newt were practically interchangeable, and I swear Teresa and Brenda were the same person. Oh, I guess Jorge's dialogue was pretty memorable though... in the sense that every sentence he said ended with the word "muchacho." I don't think it can get any more stereotypical than that. Putting the main characters aside, it seemed like Dashner just threw up his hands and said "Oh, shuck it!" when it came to giving the other Gladers even a splash of personality.(view spoiler)[At the end of the book, when a bunch of the Gladers died/didn't make it to the Safe Haven, Thomas thought something to the extent of, "Oh well, I didn't know them very well anyway." Even Thomas didn't care about these people!(hide spoiler)]2. Writing style.This is the type of book that convinces me anyone can get a book published. Something about the way Dashner describes things is so offputting that it just makes me cringe. The dialogue is predictable and not at all clever. Emotions are for the most part relayed through phrases like "Thomas was angry" and "Thomas didn't know why he was so frustrated." Some of the descriptions were akin to a five-year old's writing. I distinctly remember one part where Thomas was taken aback at the sight of blood, and he called it "crimson goo." ... Let's all take a moment to reflect upon such inspired word choices.3. Storyline.While the Scorch Trials are considerably "action-packed," they somehow don't feel substantial. I couldn't put my finger on why this bothered me so much at first, but I think I've figured it out now. This book was like a YA and crappier version of the TV showLOST. A series of mysterious events occur, monsters pop out of nowhere, the motives behind WICKED are unknown, memories are clouded, etc. While that's all fine and dandy, the thing that's irksome is that there is no way every single one of these mysteries will be explained in the last book. What was the purpose of the maze? What are Grievers? How do Thomas/Teresa/co. have the ability to communicate telepathically? How did WICKED choose what variables to include? Why was it necessary for Thomas to be betrayed? Okay, even if they're not answered in the second book - fine. I like suspense as much as the next person, and I enjoy guessing... but if Dashner thinks he can build me up and not answer a SINGLE one of these questions, then he is delusional. And if these questions ARE answered in the last book and I'm totally wrong.................... I apologize for jumping to conclusions, Mr. Dashner. Maybe I shouldn't be so prematurely irritated. (But I seriously doubt he'll deliver.)4. This entire book is pointless.As in, it literally contributes nothing to the plotline. It doesn't feel as if any forward progress has been made. I bet if I readThe Maze Runner, skipped this book, and went straight intoThe Death Cure, I wouldn't be missing out. The important outcomes of this book can be summarized in about three sentences; I feel like Dashner wrote it just to make the series a trilogy.Anyway, sorry for being a rambling Debbie Downer. I feel better for getting all that out though, whew... unfortunately, I'm just setting myself up for more self-inflicted torture because I'm still going to readThe Death Cure. I've already made it this far, so I owe it to myself to justify the pain of readingThe Scorch Trialsand at least finish the damn series. I mean... the third book can't be worse than this one... right?... Right?
