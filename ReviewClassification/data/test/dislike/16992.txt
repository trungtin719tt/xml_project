I have one question .WHY??WHY??WHY??I was so excited to start this book because of all these amazing reviews and its high rating.Unfortunatelly it turned out to be a nightmare for me.The prologue was amazing and quite promising.The fact that she(view spoiler)[lost her family in a car accident(hide spoiler)]added a dramatic tone in the story which I really liked.The first chapter described the first time they met each other.Guess what???Everything wasOKuntil Braden opened his mouth."I have a girlfriend but I'm not blind.Just because I cant do anything , doesnt mean I'm not allowed to look."Hmmm because he is not in love with his Barbie?? Yup maybe.Braden is your typical millionaire who is a little ruined.Among the other ruined millionaires that I've read about Braden is my favorite.He wasnt that annoying butstillsometimes I didnt like him.Joss had many issues.She was having panic attacks(view spoiler)[when she remembered her family(hide spoiler)].I get that she has ruined and traumatised but she was a cold(view spoiler)[bitch(hide spoiler)]most of the times.I liked her confidence but not her personality.She was so immature and she was acting like she didnt care about anyone while she obviously did.Let me give you an example .(This was happening through the whole book but in this moment I wanted to kill her)"You're lying."Yes I'm lying babe but I wont survive you and you wont survive me."I'm not.I dont love you."Ughhh SERIOUSLY??She was torturing both of them whithout any reason.I wont judge her because she accepted his proposition but I will judge her because she was freaking out all the time.In this book I enjoyed a lot the side story . Adam and Ellie were so unique . Adam was acting like a caveman which was really funny and Ellie was the most adorable person in the book!If I continue reading this series , I'll only read their story.Last but not least , the biggestWTFmomentEVER.In that chapter Braden was teasing Joss by tickling her.Things got out of control and he tickled her more than he should.I'll blame my bad english in this point. I read that she(view spoiler)[broke wind(hide spoiler)]and I didnt understand what that actually meant until a few lines below where the word(view spoiler)[fart(hide spoiler)]was mentioned.Anyway , I hope I wont get flagged because almost all of you guys love this book but mostly I hope I didnt offend you .If you havent read this dont get discouraged by this review you may love this book like many other readers did.
