This book was so bad, it ruined the author and book's audiobook narrator for me.Soooo boring, superbly annoying character and an extremely mediocre story.This is the type of books I ask myself "why is it so popular?"Like why do people like this?I didn't even bother completing this crap. When I wasn't dozing off while reading, I was annoyed by the fucking heroine and her love interest.
