I am so pumped for the finale of this amazing series! It's the final show down where The Heroes of Olympus, our heroes finally show the giants who's boss.I know I'm coming across as conceited by saying that theywillwin, but:1. This book is pitched for tweens - how can therenotbe a happily ever after?2. My brainwhich is slightly irrational when it comes to anything Riordan relatedrefuses to accept the possibility that anything bad could happen...Oka so I might be in denial here, but who isn't hoping for the best?Mingled amongst the excitement, there's apprehension. Because it is the end. No more laugh out loud Leo, adorable Percybeth moments, or the final quests where nothing goes according to plan? Nada. I'm feeling a little weepy insideOkay, so maybea lotwould be more accurateThe only plus side I can see to this whole 'last-book-int-the-series' dilemma is that if there is one person who can conclude a book series like no other (recall;The Last Olympian), it is Riordan!
