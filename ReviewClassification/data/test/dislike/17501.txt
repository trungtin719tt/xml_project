I received this book via BookTasters in exchange for an honest review. Due to the intensity and seriousness of this book, I'm going to veer from my usual standard of reviewing books. Here goes...1. This book is tough. It is very detailed and graphic. If you have a high sensitivity regarding child molestation and abuse, let this review serve as a warning. As a victim of child molestation, it raised so many uncomfortable emotions within me that I did not think I would finish it. This is not a negative. It is life. It helped me be honest about what I have buried and what I have resolved. It helped me be honest about the amount of work that I still have to do within myself. For that I am grateful.2. The author has shared her story with unbelievable intimacy. I love that she has found peace, and continues to seek such peace, in God. I know what it is like when every single person who should love and protect do not. In such a situation, the journey towards God is quite precarious. For me, it was damn near impossible. Nikolov's story definitely reignites a long extinguished hope.So... why a rating of 2?I did not feel any connection to the characters. The story came so fast, so hard, so raw...with very little character development. A story this intimate needed more development. The style of writing caused the characters to fall a bit flat. This made it very hard for me to connect to the book.This is my personal review and I have to be honest; however, I would advise those interested in reading the book to read the book. I will most likely read this book again. Any book that incites such emotions can also provide healing.
