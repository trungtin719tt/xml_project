Well, I don't know what I was expecting . . . thesewerea bunch of stupid tales.I mean, maybe something with a little more humor or wit? Then again, my mom read one of these little stories and laughed out loud, so it's definitely a hit or miss thing.To know if you'll enjoy this little book of stories, here's what's basically inside:"There once was a really ugly duckling. But then he grew up and just became a really ugly duck, The End."The illustrations were beautifully detailed and painted in a very unique style that reminded me a bit of reading Coraline, which was nice! But I just couldn't enjoy this little book overall. The humor wasn't my thing, sorry!
