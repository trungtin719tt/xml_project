It took awhile for me to finally determine where exactly Allan Ginsberg sits in my book reviewer rating scale.Truth is, I was lured in by all the hoopla this collection received in 1956 when it was seized by U.S customs. It's just not easy for me to review poetry.Do I understand why AG set the world on fire in 56? Totally!Was it the type of writing that made me HOWL ? Mmmm ..maybe more like a whimper?Goodreads Review 24/06/19
