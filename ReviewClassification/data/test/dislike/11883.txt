After readingTwilight, I can't forgive myself of buying the expensive hardback set and for the punishment I won't read any paranormal books or vampire related books. But after I met this girl in Goodreads she recommended a lot of young adult paranormal books and I was likeHuh?, no idea of the books she mentioned.I met her last December, face-to-face, and I'm glad she include one of her vampire books. No doubt I grab it and hide it, I know nobody is interested in reading the book except me, the girl and the other girl. Yes, both girls, I don't know why they liked to read this kind of books.This is better thanTwilight, in my own opinion. First (1) I find it more realistic, I want the old tradition of vampires not the sparkling vampires. Although the author added some additional new formed vampire facts that I find it ridiculous. (Can't remember it anymore.) Second, (2) She included a ghost in the story, it's kinda weird but I find it interesting. Third, (3) No hardcore romance. Lastly, (4) I can relate to the protagonist of the book always being bullied by others. Don't pity me and I don't like somebody will look at me that I havemajor majorproblem in life.Claire Danvera first year student of TPU been bullied by bad girls called theMoniketes. (Almost the books that I've read bout college thing, they always have this protagonist that always been bullied, a nerd or something. Have they ever think of changing that concept?) They are the queen bee of the school, like a bitch modeling there ugly bellies in the hallway as if they looked beautiful.So Claire, decided to find a new place, rules are rules, students who are below 18 or 20 are not allowed to find a new apartment or room outside campus. But Claire can't take it anymore, so she entered this weird house called Glass' House and met Eve, Shane and Michael.Eve, is a gothic girl who works in a bar and had this mysterious co-worker,Oliver.Shane, an experiment vampire who had a crush on Claire. WhileMichale, the owner of the house and a ghost, he usually the one who protects the place and he works as the Protector.They have been chased by the ugly vampires and the ugly Moniketes who are unbearable because of there spoiled attitude because of the lost book which contained the secrets of the vampires.Glass Houses.The things I hate about this books is that the author always makes the character mysterious until the middle end of the story and it makes you busy thinking of the characters than reading the story. Like Shane and Oliver, you thought both of them are just simple characters or supporting ones but they had big roles in the ending.I thought the Glass' house looks like the house above. It was walled with mirror and windows. Don't blame me guys, but it was the author's fault, I don't know that it was Michael's surname. But I want to have one of those glass houses.Rating-Glass Housesby Rachel Caine,2 Sweetsand wishing those vampires with prosperous days of garlic and chili. (Not bad for those people who really likes to try books that are far from there normal reading list. I recommend this to people who likes to read urban fanstasy, swear you wont regret it.
