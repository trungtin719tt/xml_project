............................"Vampire of the Banalities"This is a very unimpressive work. So very hyped up at the time of it's publication! And so representative of the worst of one our most self-inflated and shameless decades.Certainly, the eighties produced some good literature; but that did not include this work.This book purports to tackle some of the more challenging issues of our times: race, power, capitalism, etc. But this ends up as a superficial writing exercise in the author's own conceits. It is like listening to that show off at the party. You learn about as much. And you enjoy it about as much. I read this more than twenty years ago; and I still can't get the taste out of my mouth.There are other books much more deserving of your time. And you already know their titles.Your time is precious. Go read a book more worthy.
