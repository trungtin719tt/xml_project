Having finally finished reading this series, I now sit here utterly dumfounded as to how people can straight-facedly refer to them as classics. The first book in the series, A WRINKLE IN TIME, I thought was sort of OK, but that was because I expected the events of the story to be continued and expounded upon in the next book. When I saw that such wasn't the case, my appreciation for it deteriorated to the point that I'm no longer even happy I read it. The rest of the series is hardly even worth mentioning. Sure, they're creative and do a great job of challenging the normal boundaries of YA literature, but...BUT...they are also a big, steaming pile of poorly-written nonsense. For example, in the second book, the main character takes a tour of her brother's mitochondria while riding a magic unicorn and using telepathy to communicate with her school principle. The science in these books is highly suspect, the continuity is near non-existent, and L'Engle's philosophy is...well, in some ways, I'm still trying to get my head around it. L'Engle follows in C.S. Lewis' footsteps by incorporating creatures from pagan mythology into what are, essentially, Christian fantasy stories--only L'Engle's tales also contain a surprising amount of Darwinian ideas, as well. Also, the fourth book in the series reminded me a lot of TWILIGHT for some reason. More specifically, TWILIGHT mixed together with the story of Noah's flood. It featured lots of seductive young men who were half human and half angel and could transform into such things as dragons and lions--whenever they weren't hitting on virginal young maidens, that is. As with the third book in the series, I couldn't even bring myself to finish it.
