I decided since I had never read the Bible this was the year, so I've started. Here's what I learned: Genesis is interesting with a good narrative, and has some good funny names, like the brothers Huz and Buz. Exodus is engrossing while they're still in Egypt, but once they get out of Egypt, it's a big bore. All that happens is that God gives them directions for building the tabernacle and so forth, so it's basically like reading instructions for a piece of Ikea furniture. Leviticus is pretty interesting, in the sense that I see where all those bizarre rules come from. Numbers -- well, they don't call it Numbers for nothing. Kind of like reading spreadsheets. I'm hoping Deuteronomy picks up.I'm reading the King James Version because it's the prettiest. Don't care much about accuracy of translation.I do like Psalms (I skipped ahead a bit); it's basically like reading poetry.Further updates as warranted.Update January 2011: Well, I finally got through Numbers. What a slog. I have to admit that I started skimming because if I had read one more description of a burnt offering I would have offered myself up just to make it stop.And here's the really bad part: I start Deuteronomy, and what do I find but that the first part of the book gives a short summary of what had happened in Numbers. So I could have skipped the entire thing and basically read the Cliffs Notes. Oy.Anyway, onward.Update August 2011: Finished with Deuteronomy. Finally! Moved on to Joshua, which is lots better (I'm having the feeling that the histories are going to be a lot more interesting than the Five Books of Moses, or at least more interesting than Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy). But I keep getting distracted by other books, so, in keeping with the Jews' wanderings through the desert, this might actually take 40 years. I hope someone sends manna.Update September 2011: Finished Joshua and onto Judges. The book itself is pretty good, although it drags in the middle, as the text in that part of the book is pretty much the same thing as reading property titles -- not exactly pulse pounding. But the stories of Jericho and Ai pretty much make up for it. What I learned from Joshua, mainly, is that Joshua was one BAD MOFO. Go read Chapter 10 if you don't believe me. Also, Joshua contains what will undoubtedly be my favorite Bible verse ever: "And the children of Reuben and the children of Gad called the altar Ed, for it shall be a witness between us that the Lord is God." Ed! I love it. Names that the children of Reuben and Gad considered but rejected: Lou, Joe, Frank.Update May 2014: Well, it's taken me only three years or so, but I'm resuming this month. Into Samuel 1, although for some stupid reason I keep getting stuck on Eli and "Here am I." Maybe because it makes me think of Yoda.
