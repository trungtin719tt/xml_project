John Grisham's concept is intriguing , but there's not much else to his credit when it comes to this novel. This is one of those instances in which Hollywood completely improved upon the story. The characters and the plot were improved upon in film- even the subject matter itself, gun control being a hotter topic than the corrupt tabacco industry. I had already seen the movie when I started reading, so my perception of the book was tainted quite early on.There was something really bothering me about this book from the time I began it, and I couldn't identify what it was until I was about 3/4 the way through, and I realized that not one of the main characters were likable. Every character, major and minor seemed to be either dishonest, deceitful, spineless, unkind, or simply under-developed.Not having read Grisham since I was a teenager, I was also quite unimpressed with his writing style. This is probably the last of his books I will ever read.
