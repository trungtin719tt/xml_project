Confession: even though Dessen's novels are generally cheesy and melodramatic, I could not resist picking up Lock and Key. The blurb made it sound good; unfortunately, it is not.This is the story of 17-year-old Ruby Cooper. Her mother recently abandoned her, and she's been living in squalor for the past few months. When social services is alerted to her situation, Ruby is removed from the house and taken to her older sister's home. Cora, who is ten years older than Ruby, hasn't seen Ruby since the day she left for college. Since then, Cora has accomplished many things, including becoming a lawyer and marrying a wonderful man named Jamie. And she has a pretty posh pad, too.Leaving her friends and her independence is difficult for Ruby. With the help of her sister, her brother-in-law, and a few new friends, Ruby will accept help from others and blossom.Here's my gripe: I think the author knows one topic--wealthy and wholesome suburban teens. When she tries to write about the disadvantaged or the outsiders, she displays her ignorance. I never really bought Dessen's "pothead" characterization of Ruby. Nor did I buy the maternal alcoholic scenario or any of the other not-so-pretty situations presented. Also, the melodrama was a bit much in this novel.Really, this novel was not my kind of teen novel. At all.
