This was incredibly disappointing and is the perfect example of rare times when a book is worse than its film adaptation. The audiobook is also painful to listen to- the voice actor is panting constantly and it made some of the dialogue incredibly uncomfortable and perverse sounding. I did not find Forrest lovable at all (see book description). If you hold the film near and dear to your heart, as so many do, proceed with caution.
