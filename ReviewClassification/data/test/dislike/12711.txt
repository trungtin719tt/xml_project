i hated this book and i try not to be offended that so many people i know liked it. basically it was too insanely triggering to me to get any enjoyment out of it whatsoever. i generally don't really enjoy people using metaphors taken from other people's experiences, and this happens a lot around amputation. since amputation is something i have actually experienced, and has impacted my life in ways i can still only begin to understand or describe, there is nowhere for me to go with a book like this. this is a tale of parents' profiting from the manipulation of their children's bodies, the horizontal abuse between siblings, the feelings of entrapment as "freaks"/disabled people who can't leave their family, and cult status of one of the children who convinces followers to amputate their limbs. what should i take from this, other than the fact that people are entertained by the freak show still. there can be no dialogue between my experiences and those of the characters - they are trapped in the reality of the author's imaginings. i can't look to them for survival skills, just a reflection of the confines i already feel in the world.
