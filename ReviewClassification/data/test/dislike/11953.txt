I think it's hilarious that these books dominate the "chick-lit" scene when they are, in fact, the most sexist books I've managed to come across. And this one really takes the prize.This is my third Kinsella book, and so far the women are always complete idiotic dip-shits that only barely manage to bumble through their careers while managing to make an ass of themselves at every turn. I find it's quite painful to read and not at all amusing. And if that's not unbearable enough, in this one Rebecca Bloomwood personifies materialism---AND THE MORAL OF THE STORY IS THAT IT'S OKAY! There will always be a sexy, successful, intelligent, no-bullshit kind of guy who will find your stupidity and poor impulse control endearing. You can rely on the fate and good-fortune of womanly endowments to make all the trivial problems in your little, frivolous bubble of world disappear.I know what you're thinking. Debt? How is debt trivial? Debt is the New-age Pandemic.No. This isn't Angela's Ashes, people. Anyone who believes that a maxed out credit-card is the definition of strife deserves this book. These are the superfluous qualms of the privileged. If I ever read another review of a book like this on how "sad it was beneath the surface" all I have to say is how sad you are beneath the surface.SL and MMM. Only good advice in the whole damn thing. You can start by spending less and not buying this book.
