This monstrosity is about to make me takeLess Than Zerooff of my favorite books list. Could this book have been worse? I don't know. I really am not sure how. If we refer back to my list of things Douglas Coupland did to screw upJPod, BEE here does them all and then some, by adding in less pornography thanGlamorama(remember the like 20+ page threesome in the middle? That was like, one of the least arousing things one could ever read, where with every page turn it was like, PLEASE let them be done having sex already? Can't you describe the people dying in the plane crash again?) but bringing in nearly as much violence as inAmerican Psycho, mostly by making us relive the kills from the aforementioned tome plus adding in some new ones.With a more-famous, possibly more-drugged-up version of himself as the main character, BEE sinks to new lows with:a) impossibly dated pop culture references (look at the date this piece of crap got released, yet in the book his kids dress as Posh Spice and Eminem for Halloween. Um, not exactly timely!);b) violence to the extent that I actually almost threw up. Like I actually clamped my hand over my mouth at one point, and I am not exaggerating this at all;c) life history of his own famousness and drug use that I mentally narrated by thinking to myself "don't care, don't care";d) the death of his (admittedly horrible sounding) father perpetrated by possiblyI) the author himselfII) Clayton fromLess Than ZeroIII) Patrick Bateman fromAmerican Psycho.I've read all his other books so god knew I'd read this one, but I finished it wishing I really, really hadn't. If I can keep you from reading it, I've done my job.
