What I didn't like:The characters were not likable to me, especially Phoebe, the main character's friend, which I found very annoying. Even the main character was hard for me to relate with. All the adults in this book had major flaws and no strong moral values. The plot was slow, filled with unnecessary mystery, and didn't make sense to me at all (for example: a teen girl telling her story about her friend to her grandparents almost nonstop for a six-hour car ride, Grandpa letting his inexperienced granddaughter drive his truck on a dangerous mountain road, a teacher reading the students' journals in front of the class, ...). The ending disappointed me. I feel I've been cheated, led to believe one thing when the narrator knew all along it was something different. I found this book in the MG section of the library, but it had a YA feel to it, with heavy themes such as a mother leaving her family, death, betrayal, and the mention of Grandma running away with the milkman for three days because Grandpa was swearing too much. Um... Okay! Sorry, not for me.One Positive Point:The writing itself was good, and I felt like I was in the hands of an experienced writer.
