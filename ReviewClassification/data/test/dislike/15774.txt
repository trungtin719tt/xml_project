One of John Grisham's books that I liked less than many of his others. This one reminded me why I stopped reading him for so long. Maybe I need to stay away from his mid-to-late 90s books. I listened to this one on audio nd there were so many characters introduced that I had difficulty in keeping people straight. I have a background as a litigation paralegal, so this should be right up my alley so to speak, but I felt my eyes glazing over and just feeling confused who was who and what was what. Maybe this was one of those books better off read, but I still don't know if that really would have helped that much.
