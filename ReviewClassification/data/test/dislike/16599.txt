Well, that was a waste of time. I LOVE the film. It's one of my favourites and I've seen it dozens of times. The book, however, was not even remotely impressive. The dialogue was just so...flat. I felt no emotion in any of the characters and none of them really felt individual to me. I couldn't bring myself to care about any of them and their interactions seemed so stiff and forced. Most of the book is taken up with references to fashion labels, so much so that it was like reading one big giant advertisement. I am quite disappointed but I guess it's just a rare case of the movie actually being better than the book.
