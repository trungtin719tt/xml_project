Too many storylines, so little cramped space. I think J.R. Ward spent so much time interweaving the various storylines that she let the main love story lapse. This is supposed to be Phury/Corima's story and it ended up becoming a race to see how many characters she could cram into the book. Yes, she moved alot of different plots foward but in the end, she ended up not giving Phury/Corima the storyline that they deserve.One reason I love her books is because she gets me invested in her characters. She brings them to life. She wants you to get to know them in every way. She used to tell the main love story and yet involve everyone else in a way that still drove the main story forward. But this time she dropped the ball big time! I was so disappointed. She gave Corima so little personality that her pairing with Phury was lifeless and dull. Her decision to kick Phury out of the Brotherhood was just wrong, wrong, wrong and even more wrong!
