This is my husband's favorite book. Obviously he is more effective than I am.Dividing my life into squares, writing in those squares the things I have to do, then doing the "most important" may make me effective, but is that my best life?Choosing to do the things that I want to do rather than the things I need to do, adds interest to my existence. If I take the scenic route, and run out of gas doing it, I find adventure, and often meet AAA wrecker drivers who could write books on their experiences. By forgetting birthdays and anniversaries, I find out who really loves me for myself. By forgetting about the time and shimming the door knob that has been bothering me for weeks, and then remembering that it is time to pick up my child from school, he learns independence and I can cross the darn rattling doorknob off my to do list. It's been driving me nuts.I am tempted to write the 7 habits of highly haphazard people.1. Be creative with your to-do list. Add color and doodles. If you can read it, you are not trying hard enough. Lose it.2. Buy something you will never use, but if you can use it in a unique way (for which it was not intended) do that. (Colanders make great Halloween alien helmets. Add pipe cleaners for antennae.)3. Set some clocks in your home ahead by a few minutes and some behind for a few minutes. You will learn a great deal about yourself and others.4. Get a cat. Dogs make you feel important. Cats teach you humility.5. Relish the wonder of soap bubbles blown in the sun.6. Take the road that you've always been curious about. See where it goes. Learn how to turn around quickly in tight places.7. Really listen to a small child as often as possible.I am enjoying writing this, especially since I have company coming in a few moments and scads of things to do before they get here.
