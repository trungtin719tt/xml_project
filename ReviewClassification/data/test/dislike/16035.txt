There was a time when I had to read a book before seeing the film adaptation, which led to some rather unlikely choices for me.The Horse Whisperer, for instance, was not even my kind of movie, let alone book, but its three stars made a date in the movie theatre a must.I have always been a big fan of Robert Redford, especially his work as a director, and his choice to makeNicholas Evans' novel intrigued me. I have always been in love with Kristen Scott Thomas too. Lots of people roll their eyes up at my crush on her, but there has always been something darkly attractive about the woman, and I'll gladly watch her in any movie, any time -- even playing a depressed, spoiled Mom who rediscovers love. Finally, I'd heard that there was a brand new actress in the movie named Scarlett Johansson who Robert Redford expected big things from, and I wanted to see her for myself.So I was stuck going to the movie, and that meant I was forced to read the book. (Luckily I don't feel compelled to read the book before I see the movie anymore, or I'd have had to readTwilight, and I wouldn't want to do...oh, wait a minute...)I don't remember much aboutThe Horse Whisperertoday that doesn't appear in my mind as pictures from the movie, but none of what I remember is negative, and that has to count for something.I remember the love affair between Annie and Tom fondly, appreciating how it took place between mature people who could recognize what their love meant and still go back to the other people they love, stronger for their moment in time. My memories are not clouded by anger or frustration (a common feeling I retain from wildly popular best sellers that disappoint), despite the fact that I remember the prose being pretty uninspiring.And, finally, I remember thinking the book and the movie were about as good as one another. Interesting diversions, but nothing more. Still, if I were to recommend either version to anyone, I suppose I would recommend the film, if only to see Scarlett Johansson in her first major role.I'll never readThe Horse Whispereragain, but it was good enough that I haven't entirely forgotten it a decade later, so that has to count for something too. Doesn't it?
