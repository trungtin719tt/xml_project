I have read this book. Really. It took more than a year, laying at my bedside (the book, not me). Mark Twain was spot on when he called it "anesthesia in print." I have rarely been so underwhelmed. I only wish it were possible to give it less than one star.Five thousand 5-star ratings? Come on, people. The church may have suggested such an obvious ratings campaign as a means for proselytizing. But a 4.57 rating is unlikely to make me read it again: this is hardly a popularity contest. Far more important is what this says about the critical abilities of 12 million people who believe what is propounded here and in other official church dogma. I am embarrassed that so many of my fellow citizens are so gullible. How desperate must their spiritual lives be to find succor here!For those of you intrepid enough to have got throughThe Book of Mormononce, let me recommend an antidote:Who Really Wrote the Book of Mormonby Wayne L. Cowdrey, Howard A. Davis, and Arthur Vanick.Update 12/06/11: I continue to be fascinated by the Mormon phenomenon and check now and then the reviews of the BofM. The spread of votes doesn't concern me, since it is obviously a public relations manoeuvre on the part of the LDS church. Look instead at the paltry number of votes at 2, 3 or 4 stars: apparently you either worship this book (literally) or see it as a very human creation and not a very good one, at that.Someone felt compelled, in the spirit of openness, to suggest that my review was harsh. I took a look at their reading list and remain unconvinced.
