Burroughs is a good author, but this book made me sick to my stomach.This book is about Burroughs childhood. He lives with his crazy mother and alcoholic father until he's ten. Then his mom moves him in with her crazy psychologist. They live in squalor.I can't even describe to you all the horrible things that go on in this book. A lot of pedophilia. When Burroughs is 13 his 33-year-old stepbrother starts having sex with him. His step-sister, Natalie, gives her first blowjob at age 11 and is sold for cash by her father at age 13 to a 41-year-old man who has legal custody of her as his "daughter" but is really having sex with her and also beating her.Many other bizarre and horrifying things happen in this book. Besides the rampant pedophilia, there's a lot of severe mental illness and some animal cruelty.It's 10x worse since it is non-fiction.My low star rating has nothing to do with Burroughs's writing, but instead with how this book made me feel. Depressed, hopeless, and disgusted with what can happen in this world.
