I love the film, but hate this dang book!RUN, READER, RUN!There are very few books that I really hate, and definitely this is one of those few books that I truly hate and even I regret the time invested to read it.There are several books that I didn't enjoy to read them or I thought that they could be better, etc...However to reach the level of hating the book that's something that it's not usual for me.So, you're being warned! Run, reader, run!PLAYING DEVIL'S ADVOCATEMaybe (juuuuuuuust maybe) my hate it's not fair with this book.Since my hate for the book is due my expectations about it, after watching the film "adaptation". (I used quoting marks on the word adaptation, since book and film couldn't be more different! Actually, I believe that Robert Zemeckis, director of the movie, could film it with other title and there wouldn't any court able to say that he used the book without permit).Too much of devil's advocate!Returning to hate mode!THROUGH A MIRROR, DARKLYYou have to understand that I love the movie.It's a fantastic film with such lovely characters that you care about them.However, my experience with the book reached the realms of traumatic and awful repulsion.When you really liked a novel, it's quite easy to make a review about it without using any spoiler, but I think that when you didn't like the book, it's quite complicated to avoid to point out why you didn't like the book.Especially if I hate the book as much as I do.So the following text contains spoilers comparing the film with the book...(view spoiler)[ First of all, I have to explain that Forrest in the book is really a big strong guy with some mental retardation, so it's not anything like Tom Hanks.I comment that, not in a negative light, but that it's crutial for many following things in the book.Since Forrest in the book isn't an innocent sweet guy but a dirty minded creature.OK, Forrest and Jenny weren't friends in their childhood and so, there isn't a scene of them hiding in the corn field escaping from Jenny's dad.In the book, they barely met for a few days on first grade and...BAM!, no more relationship.They met again in college, and Jenny looks for him, BUT not for some tender reason, no, she is looking for him due that he is a very big and strong guy, so, he must have a really big pennis and she just want to f**k with him.Later, Jenny didn't get AIDS and she didn't get married with Forrest.However, she got pregnant alright with a baby from Forrest but she sued him for an alimony, and she married another guy...Aaaaaaaah????!!! Whaaaaaat???!!!What kind of evil mirror universe is this?!!!But what it's this crap?!!! Dang!!!No, no, no!!!(hide spoiler)]THAT RISKY THING CALLED EXPECTATIONSorry, I know that the book was first and it's not a fault of the book if the film presented having a very different story.However, I think that with the events as resulting in the book, I don't think that I'd be able to enjoy that story, in any case, since still it a very depressing and gross story.Maybe I could be not so harsh about it, but still I honestly believe that I'd give it a bad review anyway.To be fair, I think that the only scene in the book that I found out quite amusing was when Forrest got into the Apollo Space Program, since that particular scene isn't in the film adaptation, therefore I have nothing to compare to it.So, if you really, really, REALLY, haven't anything else to read instead of this, AND if you are up to read some twisted dirty minded tale, well, maybe you'd be able to enjoy this book.But I hardly doubt it.
