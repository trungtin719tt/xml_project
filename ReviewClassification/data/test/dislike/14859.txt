Is it possible to have a hesitant relationship with a love or hate book? Because I think that's where my mind is at. Parts of this book were enjoyable for me, while many others were "I want to choke a bitch right now" moments.Thoughtless has been compared to Beautiful Disaster, and I can see where the comparisons are coming from. Both books are high on the back-and-forth drama. Both books have a male lead who is a lady- killer, able to bag any woman he wants, and often does. Both books feature a female lead in college, and have a roommates falling-for-each-other scenario.This review sort of has mild spoilers, but I say to read it anyway because I'm not going to divulge anything major or reveal the outcome. I just want to bitch about Kiera's insensitivity. Go on this bitch-fest with me, please. I need to rant to you strangers out in the Goodreads universe.The couple in Thoughtless was a 1 step forward, 15 steps back, type of deal. If you thought Travis and Abby were stubborn, you'll find Kiera to be stubborn, clueless, and ridiculous to the extreme. This woman has two incredible guys willing to do whatever she wants, and instead of picking one to settle down with, she strings them both along selfishly, deciding that she can take her time to make a decision and pick one person to be with. After all, cheating is the cool thing to do, right?If Kiera had figured out her shit earlier in the game, I would have enthusiastically given this book at least 3 stars. The cheating didn't bother me to start. People make mistakes. We're all human. That said, this girl should have put on her big girl pants and figured out what to do after it happened once, twice, etc. She ran out of excuses pretty early on, and I never warmed up to her because of it.Will I read the next book in the series? Uh...hell yeah. I do love me some drama, after all. I wish it had been nipped in the bud earlier on, but a little bit of drama is always fun, up to a point. Here's hoping the next book won't frustrate me as much.Who knows? You may find that Kiera doesn't grate on you the way she did with me. I actually liked both Kellan and Denny and didn't have problems with Kellan the way some others did. He was pretty upfront about who he was. Was he a bit too much of stereotypical caveman-type male? Possibly. But hey, I like my guilty pleasure men. Sue me.P.S. On a completely unrelated note - part of me really wants to rename this book toChuckles and the Blushing Crybaby. If you read this book, you'll understand why.*edit* to add that the second installment didn't bother me as much. It did actually have one extremely funny scene (one of the only scenes to ever make me actually laugh out loud). I did end up liking where book 2 went, so my thoughts are not all negative.
