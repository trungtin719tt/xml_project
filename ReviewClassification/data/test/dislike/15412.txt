I'm working on a major project, and I figured, since I've got several books on my currently-reading list that I'm not likely to complete for years, I might as well add another, and share my progress here.I am trying to read the entire Bible, as an adult, for real (no cheating, skimming, or skipping, not even dietary rules or geneologies). I have been meaning to do this since childhood, because, beyond the religious aspect, I feel that the Bible (or at least some big chunks of it) is essential reading for any educated person; furthermore, knowledge of the Bible is a great help if you're interested in literature. It's a book that many claim to have read, but few have actually read cover to cover, and understandably - this is not easy stuff. It makes the Odyssey look like a trashy adventure novel.I've been working on this for about a year now, and I'm obviously not moving too fast. My motto is "baby steps, baby steps."Why the NIV? I'll be honest. Of all the translations I've looked at, this one is the easiest to digest, without being totally dippy. ("The Message"? Uh. No.) I tried the NKJ, but wow, that was slow-going. I prefer its poetry, but I also like to be able to progress through more than one sentence per sitting.As you can see, I started with the NT, but skipped Revelation (because ... whoa ... I have no idea what I'm even reading about there) and then started back into the Hebrew Bible, where I've almost polished off (survived?) Leviticus. It seemed easier to start with the NT (because, um, it's shorter) but now I'm realizing I'll have to reread it when I finish the rest of the book, because, hello, the NT actually doesn't make much sense without the Hebrew Bible. Smart people warned me that this was true, and I ignored them, but they were right.Ahem. This is gonna take a while.So here's where I am right now:1.	Genesis - Read2.	Exodus - Read3.
