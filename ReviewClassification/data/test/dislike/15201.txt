This book was mediocre.The author has some good ideas but the execution is terrible. His writing is amateurish and frustrating to read. None of the main characters are likable. Still though, I find myself wanting to know what will happen next, strange as that seems.I didn't hate this book but I'm glad I didn't spend money on it.Seth and Kendra's parents are going on a cruise and they need to dump their kids off at their grandparents' house. Of course, Seth and Kendra are grumpy for being left behind while their parents get to enjoy a vacation, and they prepare themselves for two weeks of boredom spent with grandparents they don't even really know. Once there though, they realize that their grandparents' home and the land it sits on is not at all ordinary and proceed to get themselves in all kinds of trouble with fairies, witches, and even a few satyrs.My single biggest problem with this story is every main character is either unlikable, irresponsible, or both.First off, I wanted to smack Seth on more than one occasion.He's selfish, stupid, and a horrible brat. Seth is the type of kid that takes out a magnifying glass to fry ants. Even when he does something wrong he barely gets reprimanded. And no matter how many times he's told not to do something he does it anyway, getting himself and others into trouble.Many of the problems that the characters encountered could have been avoided if Seth wasn't such an idiot.Kendra isn't much better though.Her main personality trait is not getting into trouble. She's a flat character that comes off as bossy and know-it-all. She also avoids trouble by making her brother do dangerous things that she doesn't want to do. Kendra uses Seth as a guinea pig for things that could kill him, for real, and she barely thinks twice about harming her younger brother.I think the main thing that bothered me about this book was the relationship between Kendra and Seth.I don't know if my younger brother and I just got along better than most siblings, but a lot of the things that Kendra and Seth say and do to each other are downright mean.It really made me like both of them that much less.The kids' grandpa is the most irresponsible one of the them all, considering some of the minor and a few of the major problems could have been avoided if he had been more upfront and honest with Seth and Kendra.He either doesn't trust them or thinks they're on a need-to-know basis, but whatever the reason he keeps them in the dark throughout the novel which results in plenty of mishaps. He even says that "what you don't know can hurt you" but still doesn't tell them the whole truth most of the time. This was very frustrating.The mythologies and legends told throughout the story are convoluted at best.The author tries to blend these things together and it just ends up a mess with naiads, fairies, witches, demons, and ogres running around. Nothing gets developed really well and it just seems like the author through in creatures that he liked or wanted to write about, not ones that would necessarily make sense.I was surprised about the amount of violence, death, and nudity in this book.Not to mention; giant teats. Kendra even drinks blood at one point. I honestly don't care, but I can imagine some parents wouldn't be happy about it.I plan on trying the next book against my better judgment. I'll be getting that one from the library as well though, I can't justify spending money on this series.I want to know what's going to happen with some of unresolved storylines enough to pick up the second book.Here's hoping the series improves.
