This book was horrible, if I could give it half a star I would. It's really unrealistic, if someone was living in a Wal Mart in real life, they'd be arrested, not given a job. And I thought Forney was a complete loser &amp; Novalee was dumb to be so attracted to him, &amp; I think the author had way too much fun thinking of ways that God could punish Willy Jack, the loser father of the baby, because all these horrible things happen to him. It makes teenage motherhood look glamorous &amp; sends the message that if you get into the situation that Novalee did everyone will love you &amp; embrace you. And one last thing, I thought "Americus" was a really stupid name for the baby.
