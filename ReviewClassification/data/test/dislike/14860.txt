Oh. Oh, my.This the single most outrageous book I have ever read in my life.Haters of Twilight, 50 Shades, Beautiful Disaster... you have read nothing yet!This is the epitome of everything that is rotten, unhealthy.... and just intrinsecallywrongin a romantic relationship.This book takes the concept of Too Stupid To Live to a whole new level. I really don't think I've felt so strongly about a literary character EVER in my life. Loathe doesn't even cover it. I wanted to murder the book. Kiera is the most idiotic, selfish, undeserving, lying bitch in the whole world. Actually: Kiera, the only thing you deserve is to die, really.I cringed so many times. I would think, "no, she is not possibly going to say or do thaaaat" ... and then she would!If you want to know EXACTLY what never to do in a relationship, read this little 1000 page tome. It wasn't a 1000 pages? Really? 'Cause it felt like it. The story was over by the time I was 20% in. Then it only draaaagged and dragged. But I was good: I skimmed right through the end!The fact that there's a sequel to this, after all the pain and heartache and plain bad writing, and the fact that Kiera is, in fact, still alive, terrifies me to no end. Kellan, rock god, run away while you can!!!I don't wish this book on my worst enemy.
