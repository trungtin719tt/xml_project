Specialsis the conclusion of a trilogy; the Uglies series technically extends to a fourth novel,Extras, but the story follows a new girl and not Tally Youngblood, the perspective character of the first three books. However, there was no satisfying conclusion to be found inSpecials, as it seemed like the same story recycled for the third time.That's not to say there weren't enjoyable parts. Westerfeld knows how to write action sequences, and despite my frustration with the story, I could occasionally pause to enjoy chases or escapes, even if the Armory seemed to drag for far too long. Also, many elements that needed to be resolved were to some degree: different cities, Tally's interactions with Dr. Cable, and even the wilder people established inPretties(although it wasn't quite resolved enough).However, much of the story fell flat. Zane's death was particularly unmoving for me, which is not the way a romantic relationship over two books should end, especially when death is involved. And as I mentioned in the beginning, the formula of Tally being forced into a change and having to overcome it really got old. I read the first two books quickly, even with my misgivings, but getting throughSpecialswas a slog, to say the least.What I missed the most was the strong descriptions of the wild and the city as presented inUgliesandPretties. The Rusty Ruins and New Pretty Town were amazing in my head; I'm a sucker for interesting world-building. I was so busy trying to get throughSpecialsthat I couldn't enjoy any of the description, so I can't really say whether or not it was the failing of the author or just that I didn't read carefully enough. The fake slang was also really starting to wear on me, since it seemed forced.My initial reaction toUglieswas to not read the rest of the series, since I didn't get enough out of it to justify reading more of the same. I should have listened to that reaction, but now that I'm this far, I'm going to try to get throughExtras.
