I fully understand that disliking a John Green book is tantamount to asking to be shot in the head, tarred-n-feathered, and thrown in a flaming box over a cliff into a gorge of molten lava. I know that, I get that, I apologize to all whose lives I've destroyed with my hatredy.But, man, I did NOT like this book.I'm going to start by saying that from the outset of Colin's theory of dumpativity, I understood - and thought he would, too...like, immediately - that these things only work in reverse. I'm no mathematician (I was just telling my sister recently that I only got a D- in Algebra because the teacher felt so very sorry for me after all the tutoring, all the hours and tears and effort, that he didn't want to kill me with a full-on F, even though I totally deserved it, mathematically speaking) and I still get that you can only plug in all the factors necessary for this equation after the incident is over because you don't know what the factors are until you look back and see them.That's not all that bothered me, of course. But instead of listing my many complaints, I'm going to linkthis reviewI found moments ago because, seriously, I totally thought I wrote it. I was all like, "Woah! That is precisely what I was about to say!" so instead of duplicating the effort, just read her thoughts and know that my thoughts ran parallel.
