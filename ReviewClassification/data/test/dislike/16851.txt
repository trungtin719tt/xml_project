I went intoLast of the Mohicansknowing that it was by no means an accurate depiction of either the Native cultures or history that occupied so much of the tale. I approached the novel as an entire fabrication, and if anyone else elects to read this book, I strongly urge the same attitude. As to the story itself, I'm torn. Hiding in these pages is a truly great adventure, but the greatness - and sometimes the story itself - is obfuscated by the author's heavy-handed use of language. I sincerely believe that this story would only profit by trimming away the excessively verbose detritus inflicted on it by the author.Ultimately, you could do worse for yourself thanLast of the Mohicansif you feel the urge to read a classic, but you could definitely do better as well. I don't consider the time I spent in the pages of this book a total waste, but neither could I say it was enjoyable wading through all the linguistic chaff to extract what pleasure I did take from it.
