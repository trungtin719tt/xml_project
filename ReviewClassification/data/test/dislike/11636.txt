Conspiracy Theorist FantasyOh, brother.I had high hopes for this book. Such high hopes.I read and really enjoyedThe Collector. John Fowles is a wonderful writer. This book is no exception. This story takes place mainly in Greece, on the island of Phraxos, where English 20-something misogynist Nicholas Urfe goes to escape his recent relationship with his Australian girlfriend, Alison. He meets an enigmatic man who looks like Pablo Picasso, named Maurice Conchis. And then the inexplicable, the surreal, begins to happen. Mysterious twins, people in costumes. Things that make Nicholas question reality. The reader begins to question too. It's compelling at first. Seductive and erotic....all naked women become the same naked woman, the eternal naked woman; who could not die, who could only be celebrated...It becomes quite tiresome though, after several hundred pages of the same "Twilight Zone" music, the same "woo-woo" stories and odd behaviours, the endless ambiguity. It was painfully long in this regard. It lost its power - after a while I just stopped caring whether whatever Maurice, the master puppeteer, said was true, or what the real intentions of the other characters were, or what. What is real? What is truth? Is it all a big conspiracy?(view spoiler)[In the big "reveal", Nicholas is kidnapped, drugged, gagged and taken to a dramatic procession in which a bunch of people dressed in masks a laEyes Wide Shuttell him he has been a subject of a [totally unethical] psychological experiment. Perhaps that's where it should have ended. But no. Many many many more pages to follow, with an ending as limp as can be - somewhat didactic, it seemed to me - in which Nicholas has to learn how to treat women properly. Sorry, but YAWN.(hide spoiler)]An answer is always a form of death.I tend to agree with other reviewers who say this would be better read earlier in life. There are interesting ideas here, and bits of gorgeous, sensual prose, but ultimately served to frustrate and bore me.
