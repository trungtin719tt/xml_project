I deeply admired "Interview' w/its rich writing style of place and period, and its dispassionate portrayal of characters like Claudia, who after being a 6 year old vampire for decades has become a steely-eyed predator(ahem instead of a 100 year old vampire vegan w/an insatiable desire to...sit through high school english again and again). The Vampire Lestat was equally good w/a wonderful shift in perspective that gave a great new spin to the character an events that transpired. The books that followed were slight but entertaining affairs, but this latest is awful. A thinly disguised telling of Anne Rice's personal mythology of the Abrahamic religions. Nothing new: The Devil is a misunderstood humanist, while God is a brutal patriarch who walked the walk but never forgot he was the Big Cheese.There's no need for Lestat, no need for Vampires. Just a long, very long, explanation by Lucifer about the nature of reality.
