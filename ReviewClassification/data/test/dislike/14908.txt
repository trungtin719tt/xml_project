This book was pretty much a worthless piece of fluff. Anything this book does, any Barbara Kingsolver book will do about 2000 times better. This book is right on the border of dreadful.I must have gotten this book out of the trash. I hope I didn't pay even 20 cents for it at the Social Services League. Maybe I got it on $5 bag day at the Friends of the Library book sale. All I can say is that any amount I paid for this book was TOO MUCH!I read it when I was on a trip. I read it in airports and on airplanes and in hotel rooms. I left it behind in my hotel room when I checked out. I didn't want to put it in the trash can, but I sure as hell didn't want to tote it home. Maybe the person who cleaned my room found it and her/his life was changed in some positive way. I hope so. All it did for me was keep me from dwelling on the possibility of a plane crash.This is one of the Opra's book club books, which is kind of surprising because some of the books in her club are actually decent. Not this one.
