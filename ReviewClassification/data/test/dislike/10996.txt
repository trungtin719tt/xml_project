"With a little practice, writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog! Want to see my book report?"-Calvin &amp; Hobbes (Bill Watterson)Indeed, Calvin. You speak the truth. And thanks to slogging through a sample portion of that intimidating &amp; impenetrable fog known asPossession, I've learned an important lesson. Lend me your ears, gentle reader -- I'm about to whisper another truth that's been missing from your day-to-day literary drudgery.A.S. Byatt is smart.Oh, yes.A.S. Byatt is smart, &amp; she wants everyone to know it. If the world refuses to listen, she'll wedge the truth into our ears with a handful of steel-plated swabs. I suspectPossessionisn't a novel so much as an intellectual mercy killing, as she's taken it upon herself to correct the error of our feeble dreams -- i.e., that the common masses have received an education sufficient to understand the higher thinking of Literature. (Nothing culls the herd quite like an intimidating capital letter, right?)After suffering through the entirety of another impenetrable Byatt fog (Angels &amp; Insects), I'd guessed myself prepared for the onslaught. But no. There was zero chance of harmonious discourse between my inferior brain &amp; the superior Literature ofPossession.It's the simple result of a simple equation: I failed to appreciate thatA.S. Byatt is smart,therefore I failed to appreciate why I should give a rat's ass about these fictional academic blowhards &amp; their bloated, self-indulgent dialogues....But perhaps the failure isn't all my fault.A.S. Byatt is smart,remember. My undergrad-level education &amp; leisure reading hobbies are but a minor blip -- what hope did I have to appreciate Literature that proposes to celebrate the written word &amp; Victorian culture? Call me a fool, gentle reader. But even after failing to meld withPossession, I'm gripped by the most ignorant of blind faiths. I believe my wounded pride shall recover. Surely those of lesser intellectual proportions can aspire to greatness -- even yours truly as she tosses &amp; turns through another sleepless night, weeping salty tears of ignorance into a soggy, mildewed pillow.Yes, it's true.A.S. Byatt is smart. That's the beginning, the middle, &amp; the end...so please excuse me while I postPossessionon Paperback Swap. Maybe I can trade it for something I'll actually enjoy reading.
