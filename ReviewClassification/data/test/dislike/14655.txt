My interpretation of the first 60+ pages of Emma:"Oh, my dear, you musn't think of falling for him. He's too crude and crass.""Oh, my dear Emma, you are perfectly correct. I shan't give him another thought.""Oh, my dear, that's good because I would have to knock you flat on your arse if you were considering someone of such low birth."Yawn. I tried, but life's too short. Plus, I like 'em crude and crass.Cross posted atThis Insignificant Cinder
