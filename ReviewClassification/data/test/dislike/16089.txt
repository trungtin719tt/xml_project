Author's noteat end of the book ... brace yourselves, you might fall of the chair, laughing. I know I nearly did."From first to final draft, the novel went through eight major revisions until my editor and I were finally satisfied that the novel accomplished what it set out to do, that is, be a love story first and foremost, and secondly - in a way that sneaks up on the reader - a compelling thriller.""A COMPELLING THRILLER"!! This author needs to either sack the editor or read some "compelling thrillers" himself. Such a half-baked plot. It was SO OBVIOUS what was going to happen. Ended up skimming but, even so, I got the gist of it. And Mike - seriously, he came across as a bit of a simpleton. I thought maybe this was one of this author's early books or even his first book but, no, he wrote a few prior to this one.
