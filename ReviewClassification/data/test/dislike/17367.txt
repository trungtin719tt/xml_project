To me, The Iron Daughter is a book ruined by the horror known to readers as silly unrealistic YAromancelove triangle.Can you see the horror? I think we need an exorcist here...please...somebody, HELP!I actually like the setting about feys, I also like the description about the otherworldly landscapes and the different fey kingdoms, I enjoy the concept about the Iron Feys and the little twists and turns the author had offered.But what I can't stand is Meghan, the main character, acting like a whinny, impulsive, lovesick teenager, not to mention she's a total fool to believe in every single thing other people tell her. She's an opened book even after she had been warned not to show her weakness in front of the feys. Last but not least, the love triangle between her, Ash and Puck is sickeningly unrealistic.Evil love triangles, stay away from me!!!!The romance between Ash and Meghan is so bad that I don't know whether I should LOL or start crying. But eventually I decided crying is more suitable.Ash and Meghan fall in love? Just...when did it happen!?As to Puck, I know from the very beginning he doesn't stand a chance no matter how nice and funny he is, for this dude has 'friend zone' written all over his face.Puck is doomed at the very beginning, because there's a LAW for every YA girl to fall in love with the brooding, mysterious bad boy. I'd told you before!Plus, I really don't think neither Ash nor Puck act and talk like they're powerful immortals who are hundreds if not thousands years old.There're still some plot holes in the story, for example(view spoiler)[Meghan's power is supposed to be sealed off by Queen Mab, supposedly the seal cannot be broken without the help of Queen Mab or Meghan's own father King Oberon; but at the end of the story she can use her power all of a sudden without any explanation. *sighs*(hide spoiler)]And the book turns out to be a bit too predictable,(view spoiler)[I dare say Meghan will turn out to be Iron Queen later.(hide spoiler)]It's too big of a dead giveaway.
