This series is much beloved of my friends, both here on Goodreads and out inthe wilds of meatspace--he's even been referred to as Fantasy's answer to one of my favorite authors: thesuperlatively funny and insightful Douglas Adams. As such, I was excited to start the series at the beginning, hoping the wit and wisdom would overcome the warts of this early outing. Unfortunately,the jokes drew more groans than guffaws, reminding me of Mark Twain's comments on the book of friend andfellow American treasure Ambrose Bierce:"There is humor in 'Dod Grile', but for every laugh that is in his book there are five blushes, ten shudders and a vomit. The laugh is too expensive."Pratchett has none of the wry, oddball musings of Adams, and seems to me to be less the Fantasy version of that author and more the British version ofendlessly 'punny' writer Piers Anthony(though thankfully without the unsettling implications of pedophilia). After finding this one unpalatable, a friend suggested I try one of his later books, so I startedMoving Pictures, but while it was more competently crafted, I found it no more amusing. I guess you can't trust your friends.I've since been told to try another of his books--most oftenNight WatchandSmall Godsare mentioned, but I find it impossible to work up any enthusiasm for another outing with Pratchett--perhaps one day, I'll get there.My Fantasy Book Suggestions
