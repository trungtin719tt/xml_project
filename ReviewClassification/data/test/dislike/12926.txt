Scrounging around for a short book this morning, I came across this on the hallway bookshelf. Long ago, my great aunt had it on her table. I remember her telling me how wonderful it was. But this is not her copy. I opened it. The signature inside was my wife's grandmother's. What looks to be a first edition from 1955.1955! Life must have been so simple then. The good old I-Like-Ike days, after the (World) war and before the (Vietnam) war. I started to read. At first, it seemed similar toWalden--all about simplicity, only in this case a well-to-do suburbanite woman on an unnamed beach vs. a middle-aged man slash pencil maker on a pond named Walden.On p. 42 I found a bookmark. As far as my wife's grandmother got, apparently. It was a business reply card to the Doubleday Book Shop, Bishop's Corner, West Hartford, CT. (Open until 6 p.m.)Interestingly, it reads: "You have bought this book anticipating a satisfying reading experience. If the book does not upon closer examination appeal to you, bring it back to us and exchange it for another book. Our only requirement for an exchange in our shops is that the book be currently salable and in new condition. Thank you for your patronage."Wow. We're really going back in time. The LL Bean pledge, from a bookshop yet! Try finding that on Amazon today!And, turns out, my wife's grandmother was on to something, stopping as she did on p. 42. The decent start quickly devolved into stereotypes (women are inward-seeking, men outward, for instance) and 5-cent, self-help philosophizing, 50's chick-book style. The abstract words began to fall over each other as Lindbergh compared stages of marriage to various shells found on the beach.Still, I struggled through. And finished. The last of 2017, after I thought the one I finished yesterday was the last. Leaving the problem of what to read tomorrow. The first of 2018.Eh. Maybe something else short, like the back of a cereal box. Something deep, like LIFE.
