I wonder what Waller, the 8 year old doofus responsible for "The Bridges of Madison County" is like in real life. Like, is he for instance the dashing "last cowboy" he so "romanticizes"? Or more like the tepid housewife who looks at the nothingness that is Iowa (oh forgotten state! what did you ever do to deserve this?) and nods in approval. Did he grin in a stupid daze with his mouth full of Oreos... all the way teeheehee to the bank? All I know is that this belongs in the same category as (The Granddaddy of S*** novelists) Nicholas Sparks. Yikes. "Literature" doesn't come in a worse package than this. No doubt a best-seller, it was the garbage that the people yearning to learn how to make out sentences read once upon a time. Ouch.This is a genuine insult to American (&amp; non-!) readers.
