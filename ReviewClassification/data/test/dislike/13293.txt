I think I already said this in a review but I might just need a break from young adult fiction, because everyone I know who reads YA raved about this novel and I read it from cover to cover without once really engaging, and with far too many inward groans and eye-rolls.I mean, for starters, the quirky teenaged characters were, um, very quirky. Very reliably quirky. Everyone had their schtick and everyone talked like they were in a Joss Wheden show. And hey, I LOVE Joss Whedon but it's a different animal altogether when you're reading it. And by "different animal" I mean "sort of annoying after a while". For another, the book kept trying to TEACH me. Always be yourself! Think about your choices! I'm not seventeen so these messages are, well, I'm a little old for them. And christ, every other word was "fugging" and after a while you just want someone to unleash a decent FUCK to get the party started.Don't get me wrong, the plot was original albeit a little contrived and there was definitely enough awkwardly endearing teenage moments for it to be funny and authentic. And there's nothing worse than an inauthentic YA novel so for that alone, I give Green massive kudos. If I were seventeen I would have lapped this shit right up.
