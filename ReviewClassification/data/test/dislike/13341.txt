As a stand alone book it may have been 3 stars.But this is the final book of a series so it should bring things to a close with a bang. This did not.(view spoiler)[It was just a confused jumble of scenes with no continuity and no real closure. You figure that all the mysteries of the first couple of books will be solved or explained. They were not.Every element of this series is the Polar Bear from the TV series Lost - weird and suddenly there, but never explained.(hide spoiler)]As a whole, a mediocre series with a pretty decent middle, but a flat and disjointed resolution.
