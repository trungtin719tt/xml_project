I mostly enjoyedBrent Weeks' Lightbringer series so I thought I would be on a winner with Night Angel. Not so however. I persevered through some 600 pages of this, the first book, but never actually became enthused about it.I should have enjoyed it and I can see from reviews that a lot of people did. Somehow it missed the point for me. I struggled with the author's endless efforts to absolve his two main characters from the guilt of killing people. They are assassins - what else are they supposed to do? Killing people can never be right so just accept it and let them be bad guys. (think Sand dan Glokta in the Abercrombie books). And while they are being bad find a better name for them than Wetboys. That really got me down!Sadly this is a series I will not be following up:(
