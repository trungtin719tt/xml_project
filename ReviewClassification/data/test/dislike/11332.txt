Dribble, dribble, dribble. To amuse myself I compiled a top 5 list of things from this book that any future bookclubs book shouldn't include:1- a herioine who regularly wears spandex shorts (I see it was wrote in 1994, still...that was past the 80's...no excuses).2- the term "crotch wrinkles." Used in a sentence: "By five o'clock I was feeling antsy, and my rayon skirt had serious crotch wrinkles."3- a scene where a man masturbates on Ms. Plum's door (or any woman's door)4- the term "boinked" especially if it is used multiple times through out the book5- sexual references regarding a cousin and a duck, and using these as blackmail (for the record any person and a duck shouldn't be allowed, regardless of blackmail)r
