2 bemused yes bemused stars !Veronika has a mild personality disorder and attempts a serious suicide attempt. She is placed in a private psych. hospital in the capital of Slovenia. She is beautiful and artistic and hypersexual and "special" (I suspect that this is the way Mr. Coelho views himself as well)Through pretentious and contrived conversations and situations filled with half-facts, pseudo-wisdom and a whole lot of malarkey she is cured. This is not a novel but rather a vehicle for Mr. Coelho to brand his own personal philosophies to the masses. (almost like propaganda)This book elicited a bemused response from me at this age so I decided to imagine what Jaidee at other ages would have thought and felt about this book.Jaidee at 14 - 1 star- "really weird and kind of boring"Jaidee at 19 - 3 stars- "Wow that Veronika is one cool and sexi chick."Jaidee at 23 - 3.5 stars- "Poor Veronika -she is so misunderstood another victim of patriarchy"Jaidee at 28 - 4 stars - "Wow there is some pretty cool stuff in this book...very deep"Jaidee at 37 - barely half a star- " what a bunch of ridiculous bs"Perhaps this book has elements of all the above and that is why Mr. Coelho sells so many damn books.
