Went something like this:50 chapters of camping and sexual frustration where nothing really happens.Nothing happens, repeatedly.50 chapters of a wedding with a LOT of sexual frustration followed by a murder most foul, an autopsy, and sex in the stables (FINALLY!)More nothing happens.50 chapters of a large scale battle.Confrontation where guy gets his balls shot off. Maybe.Ending with us waiting for the revolution to happen.Throw in a couple of major characters almost dying (okay, she really got me with the bit about Roger, I'll admit it...)Also, a lot of assgrabbing. Which is probably better than the spanking. But still. EVERYBODY is grabbing butts here. What is up with that?I question why I keep reading these books but they keep me just entertained enough to keep going. Also there is some self loathing involved.
