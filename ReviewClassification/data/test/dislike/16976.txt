My Rating: 1/5Everyone recommended John Grisham. So I bought The Client. The reviews for the books have been mostly positive. So I thought that this is a good read but It isn't. I couldn't go more that four chapters of the book. I tried again and again but It's just not good, So you know.....So, This is a bad book. I won't recommend it to anybody. Thank you.
