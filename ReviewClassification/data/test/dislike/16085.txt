Blah is the word to describe this novel.Blah, blah, blah, and more blahs.I got it because I want to see the movie, I'll admit it. And I hope it's a whole lot better than this book.It's a remake, modern-take on Beauty and the Beast. From the beast's point-of-view. I don't know, maybe some people enjoy reading a book that is kind of a silly take on themes that could be a bit more serious. Personally, I couldn't finish this because it was very boring, and the characters seemed lacking, stereotypical, and just odd. I don't remember any of the names even! And most of all, the girl who he gets to fall in love with him drove me crazy. If someone had kidnapped me, along with my father having handed me right over to the guy, I would have not reacted like her at all. Heck, I would be grabbing the first sharp object I saw and not stopping to think whether or not this kidnapper was a good guy.I gave it two stars because I liked the whole concept, but in the end, the way the author carried out the story kind of made me want to burn the book, despite every book I buy being like a child to me.One of the first books I would mark as DO-NOT-READ-UNLESS-UTTERLY-BORED
