Okay, so I promised myself I wouldn't do this but here I go..... asKatwould sayUNPOPULAR OPINION TIME....I hated all four of these books..... hated.....UNADULTERATED LOATHING!I had posted this as a two but am changing it to a one .....muahaha... because I am not as nice as I used to be!Elena is our spoiled, popular, idiotic MC.... and I hate her, she gets everything she ever wants! She has no compassion and is completely self absorbed - how is this different than any other teenage girl you ask? She is the embodiment of all that times ten!! I HATE her!!And I love L.J. Smith, guys.... I do! I've read herNightworldseries many, many times... and herDark Visionshas one of my favourite love interests of all time..... Gabriel *swoons* :D. So hating these bothered me, A LOT, and not just because I love the show!!Okay, okay.... the reason I'm breaking my rule to not review this:I am 100% team Matt!And I'm gonna tell you why:He is sweet, he is funny, he is strong and he is kind..... he is everything I would want a teenage girl to love!! He isn't brooding, he doesn't hold grudges, he is loving and understanding without being martyrish! So why is he alone? He is alone because he is not supernatural.... and that fucking pisses me off!! Teenage boys have a raw deal right now, girls are fangirling all over vampires and werewolves and superheroes, how can a red-blooded - most likely clumsy - human boy compete with this fantasy world? He can't! And that makes me sad :(Dear Ms. Smith, if you wanted to make me love Elena and Stefan .....
