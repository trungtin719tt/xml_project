I'm afraid I was just glad to finally be done with How Green Was My Valley. It's one of the most popular of the Welsh books I've read -- the one whose popularity has been most enduring, anyway -- and it's hard to understand why, when comparing the cloyingly nostalgic and sentimental story here to the vivacious and real work of Jack Jones and even Caradoc Evans. I guess that's it, though: it's nostalgic and sentimental and it lets the reader feel all weepy about industrialised Wales, without anger or overt political leanings. B.L. Coombes and Lewis Jones weren't mourning for a hopelessly lost past, but arguing in their moment for change, for fairness, for their lives.Richard Llewellyn was writing after the fact, I read, based on other people's memories. He didn't live it, so he could afford to look on it with purple-prose tinted glasses. And I wonder how much he came in contact with Welsh Nonconformism, because the chapel was a part of his story but it definitely didn't have the same effect I see even in more modern Welsh work like Emyr Humphreys'.So, maybe I would have enjoyed How Green Was My Valley more if I hadn't read it at the same time as I was reading the hard, unshowy works by working class writers who were also miners. It definitely suffered in comparison with the passion of those, and spoke much more to nostalgia. It does capture something of Wales, I think -- parts of it made me feel hiraeth so fiercely -- and parts of the story are compelling, but I don't want to pine after a long-gone Wales. The work of the miner-writers might no longer be relevant, but Wales was very alive to them, and I'd rather spend time with that.
