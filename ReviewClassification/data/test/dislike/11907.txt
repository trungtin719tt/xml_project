I'm not Mormon; I know that this book is merely fiction and nothing more. Someone already pointed out the major flaws in credibility (horses, wheath, cities, dozens of events that never happened). This makes this book rather funny than historical. I'm pondering about sorting it under "fiction"... ;)
