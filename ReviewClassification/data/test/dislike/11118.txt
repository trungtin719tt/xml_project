Edit: I originally rated this book 2.5 stars, but on further consideration, it is more of a 1.5-2 star book for me.The writing and themes explored in this book are excellent. The writing style is unique and part of the world building in a lot of ways. I found the actual plot, particularly the "twists", as well as the characters, especially the villains, to be lacking. A predictable plot and villains who are evil for the sake of being evil can really kill a story for me and that's what happened here.I will not be continuing with this series.
