Never come across a book series that makes me hate reading so much until this one. I have an OCD-ish habit of having to read every book I buy, and for some reason I bought three more of these damn things. Yikes.My biggest issue is how come an idiot girl with vampires, werewolves/tigers/panthers/(any other random animal) in her life can be so unbelievably boring. The book is full of people telling Sookie she's wonderful, special, they love her, no less than three men/vamps/weres/whatever go all macho and protect her, and she's thrilled with that. The author feels the need to tell the reader every single piece of information about a person's clothing (which if she's female generally ends with the conclusion that Sookie hates her), or life even if they're only in the book for one page or two. Like Portia. Why does she keep showing up? Her scenes are so small and pointless, and it takes Sookie paragraphs to describe her and then she'll have only one or two sentences to say before never being seen again.Oh, and Quinn. Vomit. Gary-Stu alert. And he's a weretiger. Come.The.F**k.On.On top of that the plot is all over the place and doesn't seem to take into account a normal human/superhuman reaction. Jason's girlfriend is suffering a miscarriage, so he comes to Sookie and tells her. Her response is to make a call, and then make him lunch. Neither of them visit the poor girl in (presumably) pain. The girlfriend, Crystal, who I feel the need to again remind someone that she miscarried Sookie's niece/nephew, is never seen or heard from during this trauma nor once throughout the rest of the book.All these books lead me to the same conclusion: I hate Sookie Stackhouse.Anyone want my 9 books?
