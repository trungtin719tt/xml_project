Don't be sucked in by the hype- it just isn't that good. The story really wanted to be a tragic work of art, but it ended up being a disjointed collection of thoughts. The writing was excellent. There were great descriptions of the dogs and the landscape, but the characters missed the mark entirely. The story of Henry was promising, however after all the build up we find out that inciting turmoil of the character is that he is "ordinary". How heartbreaking.Like the Winchester mansion, the story was filled with unexplained oddities that just seemed to go nowhere. This is the second time I have bought a book that was lauded by Stephen King. I won't fall for that trick again =)
