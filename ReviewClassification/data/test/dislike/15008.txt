So bad. I was annoyed that it took so long to reveal how bad of a book it was that I had to finish just to see where the lame plot twists ended up.It is just too far fetched. The Father Sexton character is not believable at all. No father would act like that. Dan Brown looked up a little science to base his book on but "Deception Point" is about logic and statistical accuracy which he didn't research at all. The holes in these scientists' logic made the book unreadable.
