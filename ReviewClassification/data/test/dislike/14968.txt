The back cover of this book doesn't give a very good description of what the plot is about. And why would it (howcouldit?), when the plot is this much of a mess? In short: Jack McCall is an American who moves to Rome with his young daughter after his wife commits suicide, intending to never see anyone from his past again (including his own family), but he eventually comes home and starts dealing with the past.The long version of the plot is... I don't even know where to begin, the book is such a mess. In the preface alone, all this happens: Shyla (Jack's wife) kills herself before their daughter is two years old; Shyla's parents sue Jack for custody of his daughter, claiming he's an unfit father and even lying in court that he beats his daughter; everyone believes that if Jack had only been a good husband and a good father, his wife would not have killed herself; Jack retains custody of his daughter not because he's actually a good father but because of a letter his wife wrote before she died; and Jack moves to Rome to be a travel writer there and escape his past. I feel exhausted just recapping that - and it was only thepreface. Good grief. What more could happen in the next nearly-800 pages? Jack is conveniently everyone's confidant, he's at important places when big events happen, and he's pivotal toeveryone. Let me give a rundown of the book's topics:-Family secrets. Shyla's sister-in-law tracks down Jack with a private investigator and says her family wants to make up with him and they realize he didn't kill Shyla, it was hermomwho'd driven her to suicide! And if Jack would only let her explain, he'd understand. Also, they want to know his daughter and they have family secrets to share with him.-Suicide. Shyla's death is a huge factor in the book. Everyone seems to have the idea that Jack wasn't a good husband because of it. Jack even says that one of his high school friends would have put him on her list of available guys but since his wife killed herself, he's clearly not good husband material. Huh?-Hollywood! One of Jack's high school friends gets in touch with Jack; he's a big Hollywood producer now and wants Jack to write a miniseries about their childhoods. I understand that everyone thinks they have a story in them, and lots of people think the story of their lives would be a great movie, but dang. Really? This producer is convinced he needs Jack on board or it won't be a huge hit.-Abuse. There are abusive fathers and abusive pastors. There was also an incident in which Jack stopped a man from hitting a woman (everyone was in disbelief that Jack stood up to this beast!) and then ended up in jail for the night with his daughter by his side. Yeah.-Religion. Jack is Catholic and Shyla was Jewish. And yet they made it work! Everyone is shocked by the fact they worked so well together with this religious difference.-A faked death/disappearing act. One of their high school friends had supposedly died and everyone went to his memorial service, but the Hollywood producer claims the man is alive... and Jack knows where he is! This is actually true; the guy had faked his own death to get away from his abusive father and reinvented himself as a priest in Rome. Jack is the only friend who knows he's still alive. But how did everyone else hear the rumor that this guy had faked his own death? Simple: one of their old teachers, on vacation in Italy, went to confession and heard his voice as her confessor! Since she never forgets a voice, she immediately recognized who it was by voice alone and spread the word back home!-The Nazis.-Orphans.-The Vietnam War - Jack and his friends protest during this, all of which is shown in flashbacks.-Leukemia. Jack's mom is dying of cancer, which brings him back to the US. He's initially skeptical, because she'd faked cancer before for attention.-Schizophrenia.-Alcoholism.-Loggerhead turtles and their eggs.I could go on, but I won't. This book was so melodramatic, so sappy, that I felt as if I were reading aLifetime Original Movie, only for men. And covering so many topics that it wasn't even movie-length. It was more like a seasons-long series that I'd never, ever want to actually watch.Jack's daughter, who plays a bigger role early on in the book but then gets sort of lost in the rest of the madness, is precocious and completely unbelievable. The dialogue between her and Jack is particularly awkward in a book filled with tedious conversations. She never acted her age, and the author wrote Jack in a way that tried to make him seem like the perfect, absoluteperfectfather doting on his perfect, absolutelyperfectdaughter, but it was done in such a sappy manner that they never actually felt real.The writing was also poor. It wasn't completely awful - it wasreadable- but it certainly wasn't stellar. The book did not need to be so long; the book sorely needed to be edited. An example of the purple prose:After we finished the pasta, I assembled a large army of greens and arranged them deftly until they took on a disheveled order. The olive oil was extra-virgin and recently pressed in Lucca and the vinegar was balsamic, black from its careful aging in rimmed barrels, and soon the smells of the kitchen coalesced to make me dizzy as I kissed the two women in my life and poured the wine to toast the health of the three of us.This is why the book ended up at nearly 800 pages.Jack has four brothers, three of whom blended together to the point that I couldn't distinguish between them; the fourth only stood out because he suffered from schizophrenia and would rant obnoxiously. It wasn't funny, it wasn't clever, and it didn't make for good filler material - especially since so much else was contained in this book!There was a random flashback when Jack visits Venice and he recalls another time when he'd visited Venice and a masked woman led him to her house, where she proceeds to have sex with him (in pretty explicit detail) and he realizes that she would never reveal her identity to him. It was rather odd, since it affected the plot in absolutely no way.Also: there was a Jewish man who'd moved to this town way back in the day, befriending Jack's grandparents, and everyone loved him. Everyone refers to him (to his face, behind his back) as The Great Jew. I am not joking. The Great Jew.I did like one short part of the book, a flashback in which Jack and some of his high school friends go fishing on the water and end up stranded for days, having to rely on the survival skills of one of them in order to live. This part was actually interesting. But that was it. And it wasn't worth the 500+ pages it took to get there. It also had no effect on the rest of the book. But then again, so much of the book had no effect on the rest of the book.Just when the book finally, FINALLY ends... there's more disappointment! There's an epilogue! As if more needed to be said aboutanything. But it was a way to jump forward in the future and show how perfect life had turned out for Jack. This was all done in a super sappy, melodramatic manner that seemed more fit for a made-for-TV movie-of-the-week than a supposedly big saga about family and whatever else.This book was awful and way too long; I skimmed most of it because it definitely was not worth the time to actually read. I would have stopped on page 2 if this hadn't been this month's book club pick. I can't believe this book has ANY good reviews, let alone the fact that the author is a bestseller!
