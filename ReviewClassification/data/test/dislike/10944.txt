It's been three years since Mia woke up from her coma and since the car crash that killed her family. It's also been three years since Mia left Adam's life forever.One fated night, Adam walks into Carnegie Hall when Mia is doing a concert, and it seems like destiny had brought them together again. But when old wounds open up and constant questions are rolling, any hope of rekindling their relationship is broken. Told from Adam's perspective, this is a book about despair, heartbreak, music, sex, hate, anger, hope, and love.This book seemed like kind of a waste to me. AfterIf I Stay, it wasn't really necessary.Oh sure, it's written all beautifully and nostalgic and everything, but does that hide the fact that the whole story was just utterly ridiculous?Not to me.I don't care what Mia says, I don't think she had reason enough to leave Adam. Okay, I haven't lost my parents and brother in a car crash, so I can't even begin to understand how that feels like. But when someone is around you who loves you and only wants to help you, you don't push him away. If you're experiencing the problems that Mia was having, youtalk about it.Not just stop talking to him and erase him from your life!In the great words of John Green, and I can't stress this enough;USE YOUR WORDS!!!I just can't get over the fact that if Mia had just said what she was feeling, none of this shit would have happened.I believe the author maybe had this story in her head afterIf I Stayor even during it, but her agent or publishing company or whatever made her write it because the first one got so popular and they saw a big opportunity for more money.I also didn't really like Adam in this. I loved him in If I Stay, but this...I was a bit scared of him. Sometimes he would think or say something that would have me going;For example:I look at her there in the shadows of the shut down city, her hair falling onto her face and I can see her trying to figure out if I've lost it. And I have to fight the urge to take her by the shoulders and slam her against the shuttered building until we feel the vibrations ringing through both of us. Because I suddenly want to hear her bones rattle. I want to feel the softness of her flesh give, to hear her gasp as my hip bone jams into her. I want to yank her head back until her neck is exposed. I want to rip my hands through her hair until her breath is labored. I want to make her cry and then lick up the tears. And then I want to take my mouth to hers, to devour her alive, to transmit all the things she can't understand.Need I say it again?I'm going to go hide under my covers now.
