Pre-review:I am still not sure if I want to read this sequel, after suffering three books, I think I have had enough.And today I read thisreview:(view spoiler)[Rape. There is a lot of rape, attempted rape, and mind rape in this series (so far). Personally, I don't think this author could handle the subjects she was trying to talk about at all. She brushed them under the rug, which means that all of her characters also brushed them under the rug. The male love interest REGULARLY MOCKS THE WOMAN HE "LOVES" ABOUT BEING GANG RAPED. This is the man the ladies are pining after. He tells her it was her fault for not calling for help, he jokes that she shouldn't be kissing a Fae because she's had enough Fae in her mouth recently (when she was gang raped), he says that she seems perfectly fine for having been gang raped recently, he continues to humiliate her by bringing up all the times they had sex together when she was basically drugged. When she tells him that he raped her too (WHICH HE DID) (THE EQUIVALENT OF ROOFIES), he tells her that it wasn't rape because she didn't crawl away, she walked away.(hide spoiler)]Guess what? I don't have much problem with sexual violence in novels, but I'm absolutely sicked of thosewomen have to get raped first before they become badassescheap plot device and character development (if you can call it that...).Plus, have anyone ever noticed that throughout the first three books of the series, no one seems to show much sympathy nor concern toward thosePri-ya, female fey-seers who are addicted to sex with the feys. You know, feys can use seduction to force themselves on mortals, whether the mortals want it or not. So why shouldn't thosePri-yabe viewed asvictimsinstead of SLUTS who asked for it?So, don't ask me to feel sorry for Mac whennone of the characters seems to feel sorry for those Pri-ya in the first three books. No one seems to care that they might just be as helpless and victimized as poor Super Special Innocent Snowflake Mac. Those nameless, faceless Pri-ya do not deserve to be sympathized because they are not Mac, you know.But of coruse, God forbid that sympathy and care to be showed among women, that's how things usually go in this Fever series, women can only hate, slut-shame, be jealous of, try to control each other instead of showing sisterly concern and sympathy, and it sucks.Edited@25/06/2015Actual review starts here:Looking for great urban fantasy novel series with strong heroine, realistic characters, heart-stopping suspense, brave men and women going up against truly horrible situations, and great battles between good and evil? Well, please look somewhere else, you are not going to find any of these withinDreamfever, book 4 of the best selling Fever series.Yes, right. It's the fourth book already and guess what? Things still aren't getting better. Arguably, it gets worse.Okay...to be fair, the world building and the setting about the deadly Fae and their supernatural realms are still doing great, and this book really isn't as awful as the previous book:Faefever, mostly because there are a decent amount of battle scenes and action scenes with this fourth book (Faefever had even failed to provide us this,nothinghappens in Faefever), plus it's nice to see Mac finally taking matter into her own hands. Still Dreamfever continues to be marred by the same old flaws which plagued the previous three books. To make matter worse, new flaws can also be found, such as:Warning: There are unmarked spoilers for the previous book and its ending in the follow part:(1) How rape is handled in the story:You think you are going to read about a heroine surviving the traumatic experience of sexual violence and violation against her free will and body, and rape will be addressed in a meaningful way? Sorry, you had picked up the wrong book.By the end of the previous book, Mac, the main character, was raped by three Unseelie princes and lost her mind. She became addicted to sex with the deadly Fae and became mentally enslaved. Then the Male Lead of this series, the What Is His Name Dangerous Sexy Alpha Male Bad Boy (see? I'm still not going to dignify this guy by remembering his name) came to her rescue and helped restoring Mac to her sanity by...having countless of monkey sex with her until she slowly came to her sense months later.To tell the truth, I'm not against this particulate plot development, but I do know many readers are upset that What's His Name did it with Mac when she lost her mind, which made the guy as much a rapist as those Fae princes who gang raped her. And I fully understand why people are upset about it. However, I still found the scenes with Mac and What's His Name together and how things go between them to be satisfyingly written (especially the nice things What's His Names had done for Mac). I also found Mac a great deal more tolerable when she was crazy and had nothing but sex in her mind. I mean, it's still better than her hateful, judgmental old self (am I a horrible person for saying that?)Then, let me tell you what I truly have problem with. It takes place after Mac came to her sense, then she faced What's His Name once more,only to have the guy insulted her over the fact of her being gang raped.He also went out of his way to remind her *repeatedly* how she had just been recently raped. Not only this, the guy also threw rape jokes at Mac's face, for more than once.(Link:http://www.jpopasia.com/forums/posts-...)Oh, my goodness. As much as I hate Mac and want a monster to eat her, Mac still doesn't deserve this. It also makes me wonder:isthatreally the kind of guy whom women from both within and outside of the book are wetting their underpants for?A guy who insults women for being raped? A guy who says BS that basically telling the raped victim: "You had been careless and unwise, you brought it upon yourself"?(Link:http://kathy-kyuhyun.deviantart.com/j...)Not only this, who can forget Kat, a female character's loving remark of "she (Mac) asked for it"?Hell, to the no.(2) Too Stupid To Live characters (and Mac is not the only one)By the middle part of the book, Mac and Dani, the two main female characters had done a couple of dumb things, rushing headfirst into dangerous situations without checking and thinking about it first for too many times, it makes me wonder why they still hadn't gotten killed yet.And they are not the only ones. The other sidhe-seers, who hidden themselves in a 'heavily guarded abbey' to avoid the evil Fae and other monsters, are no better. Not only Mac can just went to the abbey, firing a burst of bullets at the handle of the front door and then kicked the door in and then walked into the abbey, simply because those stupid bitch sidhe-seers were so stupid that they just left the front door unguarded and unwatched.Later on, they also just left the side door unguarded so Dani could just slip back in.Later on, Mac, What's His Name and the Fae Prince (I also have no desire to recall his name) had a fight on the hallway, and none of those stupid-bitch sidhe-seers heard anything and came to check on them.That's ridiculous.(3) A lot of stupid things just...happen.I wonder had the author of this book even paused and thought about what she was writing when she created this book? I have a good guess that she hadn't because a lot of stupid things just happen in the story and characters are making some really stupid choices.For example, Mac kept on calling the guy who killed her sister 'LM', short for Lord Master. *facepalms*For example, Mac did not hesitate from drinking a cup of coffee handed to her bythe Lord MasterLM, a.k.a the evil guy whom arranged for her to be raped and whom she believed had murdered her sister.For example, Mac and Dani repeatedly and publicly disobeyed Rowena, the leader of the sidhe-seers, even stealing important Hallow Objects from her, but they never had to face any consequence.For example, no one seems to suspect(view spoiler)[Rowena for being a traitor, even after she left the sidhe-seers poorly trained, keeping life-saving information from them and then sending them off to the war zone.(hide spoiler)]For example, Mac became finer shaped and able to kick asses right after she snapped out of her sex-crazed trance. During said trance, she wanted nothing but sex, she didn't even want to eat food. But obviously tons of sex with What's His Name keep her body in shape and better than before.Ladies, let's find a Big Strong Guy and have tons of monkey sex with him! it will make your bodies more healthy and better shaped!(Link:https://www.tumblr.com/search/yamamur...)(4) Mac is the most Super Special Innocent Snowflake Mary Sue ever.It's an old problem actually, butby now Mac is so special there is a prophecy about her.Give me a break.(5) The ending.Mac was finally going to face theLord MasterLM and save her parents!(view spoiler)[But not really! Suddenly Mac is sent magically to another worlds through the Fae Slivers! So no confrontation between Mac and the villain!(hide spoiler)]Seriously, what kind of author does this kind of thing by the ending of her book?Whoever had claimed the latter books of the series are better, now I'm holding you responsible for the loss of my time and the death of my brain cells.
