hmm.. where to begin...First, the title: The Death Cure. A little misleading perhaps? I THINK SO!! There's NO cure. There's not even hope for a cure! Let's just all give up on our ridiculous plan to save the world that ended up having NO medical support at all! La de dah de dah!! The death cure my foot.Second, this book really got me thinking.... why the heck is Thomas the almighty one? I don't know how old he is, but I'm just going to go out on a limb and guess 16ish... Okay, so stick with me on this one. Thomas is a young teenager who is immune to the flair. He works at WICKED because let's be honest, what major scientific/medical research facility doesn't hire young boys?? The Creators die somehow and for who knows what reason, Thomas and his equally young friend Teresa get to be in charge??? And are just the smartest leaders WICKED could have? What the? HE"S NOT THAT SMART!Third, RIP Newt. But don't worry, Thomas will remember you every paragraph or so and his chest will ache or clench or whatever the heck it keeps doing.Fourth, no one knows who Chancellor Paige is. Convenient of her to show up though.Fifth, (are you getting tired of my counting?), I'm so glad we got to listen to Thomas complain about having no memories for the first two books and then when he finally gets the chance to get them back, he super wusses out and says no. LOVED that part. Totally ensured I'd get to read more of the stupid vague sentences that have no reward at all like "it reminded Thomas of a memory that he couldn't quite grasp," or "it frustrated him that he couldn't remember why this detail stuck out to him." Totally hooked me in with those show stoppers. (insert eye roll)Sixth, lots and lots of death. The end has a fleeing scene similar to the first one and it's hard for me to imagine it being realistic. Over 500 people tried to escape and only 200 made it?? Come on, 300 people died? In a chapter where they're escaping nothing more than a crumbling building? Those are some very poor statistics.Seventh, Peace out Teresa! You were replaced by Brenda....in the second book. You really had no other option but to be killed. No hard feelings.The end.
