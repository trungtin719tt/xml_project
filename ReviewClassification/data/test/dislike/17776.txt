I don't like Mac. I don't like Barrons. I'm not even really enjoying the story.So why keep reading, you might ask. Masochism? Some vague sense of loyalty toward friends on here who constantly berate me with, "Keep reading, it gets better!!!" Or, is it really just my obsessive compulsive NEED to see how something ends? Probably a little of all three.Once we get into the meat of the story, it's very plain to see that Mac hasn't changed, although she sure would like us to think so.She goes on and on about how she's isn't a dumb kid anymore and she knows more now than she did just weeks ago, but really she doesn't.She still makes dumb mistakes. She still talks about her clothes and appearance. She still keeps Barrons in the dark with things she should have told him in the first place to save them both from trouble. If anything, she acts MORE arrogant and entitled in this book than the last. She's a fancy sidhe-seer now, she doesn't need to worry about some pesky humans."My problems were so much bigger than this. It was an epic waste of my time."She says this after being interrogated about the death of a human. She wanes back and forth over wanting to save all of humanity or only caring about herself and her family. If you save the world, then you ultimately save your family. She's still very selfish and immature in this book and it's hard to take her seriously.My main problem with Glam-girl Mac and fierce sidhe-seer Mac is the inconsistencies that pop up.True, these trials she's gone through were thrusted upon her and she's dealt with them in a very short amount of time. But she constantly slides back to the Before Mac so much that you want to just slap some sense into her. Stop flirting with boys. Quit getting dressed up in nice clothes. Don't go blurting to a stranger/sidhe-seer in public that you can see the Fae too. If you want me to think you're serious about being a badass and that you've changed, (like you've told me NUMEROUS times throughout this book,) then actually SHOW me with your actions. Get serious, train, learn some basic self defense at least!If your problems are as big as you think, then prepare for them.Don't tell me you've changed when you haven't.Barrons is still a dick.He abuses her and she makes excuses for him. I think I know who/what he is though. I won't say though, but I have told a certain someone who shares my prediction. We'll see if we're right.V'Lane is ... interesting.I compared him to Mircea from theCassie Palmerseries, and even though I fear being flayed alive byThe Flooze,he's the best comparison I can make. They're both insanely gorgeous, immortal, want a lowly human woman who has unique powers, and view humans as tools to further their goals. I find him to be the most interesting character in the whole series.A couple ofnitpicksthat probably won't bother many people, but did bother me:Spoilers for Darkfever:(view spoiler)[Regarding the cars parked in the alley. Why leave them? Why not hire someone to come pick them up and dispose of them. Barrons has to be familiar with a chop shop or two.If a bunch of people were murdered and their cars were left behind my work and/or place of residence, I would find some way to get rid of them so I couldn't be interrogated about them.If the cars hadn't been there, O'Bannion's brother wouldn't have had a reason to grill Mac and be suspicious of the book store though. I hate when the plot is forced in this manner.(hide spoiler)]The use of acronyms.I can't imagine Barons saying OOP. I understand the need for acronyms, they do have their place, but it bothers me when it's constantly used in a novel. Just spell your words out!Asking question after question after question.Do we really need one or more paragraphs of just questions that Mac is thinking in her head? There has to be a better way to integrate this into the novel.The constant spewing of metaphors.People don't think or talk like that, sostop it.I thought this book was weaker than the last, and I felt angrier while reading it.Maybe I shouldn't have waited so long in between books and let people gently (and not so gently) prod me into reading this. Is it possible that all of the hype surrounding this series and the recent release ofShadowfeverhas soured my experience? It's very possible. I am trying to give this series a chance, but so far it hasn't won me over.Here's my review of the first book,Darkfever.
