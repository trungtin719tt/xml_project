I put it down after 190 pages of nothing. I'm tempted to burn it. It's that terrible. When I say nothing, I almost literally mean NOTHING happened.- The word u-we-tsi-a-ge-ya or whatever the hell her grandmother calls her in EVERY sentence was used probably 756 times. Listen, grams. I know you're trying to be affectionate, but Zoey's actual name is only 2 syllables...it's got to be a lot easier just saying the two as opposed to the six. Hell, why not just "Z," if you want to really take a shortcut.. As a reader, we don't need to witness that word a bunch of times in one conversation. She used it in 4 consecutive sentences. FOUR. Give it a rest.- Jack and Damien. Namely Jack. It's completely stereotypical that he cries everytime anything happens. A gay male does not a pregnant, bipolar, moody female make. The Casts are basically counteracting their overt display of being all for human equality and accepting of homosexuality by pointing out their gayness quite often within these books. Damien is feminine and smart. Jack cries anytime Zoey sneezes. Give them some dignity.- Speaking of stereotypes: Kramisha. What the hell? Because she's black, she must automatically speak like a complete illiterate? "Them kids be bad." "You's stupid." "They is whack!" "Where you be at located from?" Okay, so each of these quotes may not be from the book, but it's pretty damn close. We're supposed to believe this girl is a talented poet when the Casts have her speaking like that?- All of Zoey's obsessed male minions. No guy with attached testicles and dignity is going to follow Zoey around like a puppy, catering to her and watching her make out with each of her boyfriends, then act like she is a victim and agree to sharing her with each of the guys. That's where Erik went right. But, of course, Zoey was made out to be the hero in that situation. Because she broke up with the guy who wasn't okay with sharing her with 2 other guys and a dead angel/demon from under the dirt. She's always the victim. And the rest of the characters are vapid enough to believe it.- Stevie Rae's impending beastiality. That is all.- The plot went like this: Zoey does something magicKal (can't forget the K.) Everyone agrees. Jack cries. Zoey considers something and "kind of" makes a decision. The Twins say "twin" 15 times. Jack cries. Zoey kisses Erik. Zoey contemplates her boyfriend situation and resolves to make a decision. She doesn't. Zoey sleeps with Stark. Zoey delegates a task to everyone. They happily oblige. 10 pages pass and they still haven't done anything. Her friends delegate to some other friends, who agree. Zoey dreams about Kalona feeling her up. She drinks brown pop. Zoey makes out with Stark while Heath is rubbing her feet and cooking her dinner, all the while knitting a new scarf for her. Everyone tells Zoey that she needs to sleep because she's so beautiful and all-powerful and wise! Grandma calls her u-wan-sum-pud-din and tells her some nonsensical and life-changing cliche about truth that doesn't actually mean anything. Then the POV changes to the birdman's and I quit reading.I'm absolutely done with this series. I thought I'd continue reading it because I'd like to see if the Casts could either a) redeem themselves through the next 54 books, or b) outdo themselves in stupidity.They've succeeded at the latter, except that it wasn't even entertaining stupidity. It was boring stupidity.I hope Neferet comes back and blows everyone up with some sort of magic-with-a-K diabolical fire power.Or that Aphrodite remembers what a bad ass she is and refuses to further take place in this Barney and Friends bullcrap and punches Zoey in the face.I've never been this angry at a book. This shouldn't concern the Casts too much, as they're likely cackling away at negative reviewers like myself from the highest tower of their money castle.And yet, this book has 5 stars on goodreads...............Make your peace with God, everyone. The end is near.
