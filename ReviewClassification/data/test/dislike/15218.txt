This book was so frustrating. I wanted desperately to like it, but it was a struggle to keep reading past the first few chapters. I had major issues with Mull's writing style, and his characters were little better than basic stock characters. His mythology seemed a little bit contrived, and the history that was offered for it was sketchy, abrupt, and in all honesty kind of difficult to believe... It did show promise though, and I'm sure that the series gets better as Mull is bound to find his stride. Maybe I'm out of practice reading fantasy aimed at the elementary-early junior high set, but all of the blunt as a stack of bricks foreshadowing got on my nerves, and the fact that none of the characters showed any form of growth whatsoever made it worse. There was no surprise in the plot, and I wanted to reach into the book and grab the grandparents to shake them into speaking like real people do.The only parts in the book where I got even a little bit excited or scared or interested were the Midsummer's Eve section and the end battle chapters. But even those disappointed by resolving themselves quickly and with no fuss. I keep making excuses for why I didn't like this book, but in the end, it was just a poorly written cover of so many other great fantasy/fairy books out there. And then it didn't even attempt to do anything interesting or inventive with those stolen plots. I may read the second installment to see if Mull improves with time and experience... We'll see.
