I don't know exactly what I was expecting, but this was only partially it.Clan of the Cave Bearcertainly didn't set the bar high, literarily speaking. However, I was taken aback by the shift in tone and emphasis. Whereas Cave Bear seemed genuinely interested in being taken seriously, Valley of the Horses is more interested in titillating housewives whose macrame plant holders still boast spider plants and ferns galore. The whole book smacks of repressed seventies feminism; politics and speculative anthropological fiction make for awkward bedfellows. Or should I say bedpersons? Or should I crouch submissively at the feet of someone whose diction I admire and wait for Er to make the decision for me while simultaneously awakening in me desires and capabilities I never knew I had? No, seriously. Cave Bear was hilarious, and Valley of Horses was gross porn for women who don't want to seem like they're reading porn.The upshot is that my cat liked this book better than I did. Either someone at the library rubbed catnip into the binding, or the aforementioned macrame housewives managed to smear so much yearning, musk, and housepet dander onto the pages that my cat went completely feral whenever this book was in the room.
