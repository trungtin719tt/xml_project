I just couldn't do it! I could not read this drivel. It's not subversive. It's not funny. It's not interesting. It's not shocking. It is juvenile.Franzen's The Corrections, Roth's Portnoy's Complaint, and BBE's American Phycho are not in my favorites by any stretch of the imagination...but at least these three have ideas and can actually write even if I didn't want to read what they were writing about.And PLEASE don't compare this guy to the genius who was Kurt Vonnegut! Just don't even go there.If you think it's funny when an adult says the word "bugger" you might like this book. Otherwise, don't bother.
