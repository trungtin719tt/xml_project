Rarely do I go to a movie and say that the movie was definitely better than the book, but this was one time that was true. I really liked the movie with the great soundtrack setting the scenes throughout the 60's and 70's, and of course, Tom Hanks played a GREAT Forrest. I did enjoy how the book portrayed Forrest landing in even more incredible situations, such as being an astronaut, almost being cannibals lunch, and even rescuing Raquel Welch. I would give the movie 4 out of 5 stars, but I can only give the book 2 out of 5...See ya later... I gotta PEE! ;-)
