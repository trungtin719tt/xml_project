So I've just recently finished listening to the audiobook of Blue Moon the sequel to the infamous Evermore by Alison Noel. Now if any of you are wondering about how much I enjoyed Evermore well, until The Host it was the worst book I'd ever read. That begs the question of how did the sequel fair...Blue Moon opens with Damon helping Ever practice with her manifestation, which is the ability to create shit out of thin air. They start making out and getting hot and heavy, but Ever isn't ready. That's okay with Damon because he's a gentleman. The first half of the book is mostly made out of telling us how much Damon loves Ever, Ever dealing with her insecurities about Damon's 400 years of sexual conquest and her preparing to do the do.In the middle of her melodrama there is a new kid at school name Roman who she immediately detects to be the bad guy. Roman manages to smooth talk everyone, including Damon, but not our feisty little Ever. She can tell something is wrong with him.More in between sections until the "meat" of the story finally comes in. After being jilted by Damon over the weekend, Ever comes into school the next day and during lunch sees the entire school sitting together. Preps and Emo/Goths (because its all the same to Ever) and Jocks and Gays; all together somehow because of Roman's doing. It is from this that we get the most entertaining quote from the book:"The lions are now lunching with lambs" I almost peed from laughter.The only thing more annoying than this is the term "immortal juice" which just sounds nasty no matter how you swing it.I'm not going to rag about the plot, because honestly the plot could work if it was written better-in fact it has been written better, my real problem is the character of Ever. She is so incompetent that it is frightening. I do understand that a lead as to be somewhat incompetent otherwise our story wouldn't get anywhere. However, Ever is painfully dense throughout the book she doesn't do a single thing right, not even in minor situations. To top it all off in the final decision of the book she proves that she needs to be lobotomized.During her final confrontation with the cause of all her problems, Roman, who is a "rogue" Immortal (which doesn't make sense because the Immortals are not an organization) that has been poisoning Damon whilst turning him into a Jerk-Ass, he offers to give her the antidote to save him. There is another character there who urges Ever nor to, saying he can not be trusted.Her choice will infuriate you.
