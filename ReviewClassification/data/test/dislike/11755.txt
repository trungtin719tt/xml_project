It's been a while since I cried "uncle" but today I had to do it again. In the past several years I have suffered through William Gibson's Spook Country AND - yes, I believe I may be a glutton for punishment - Zero History (a novel about...jeans?). I did my best to stay awake through Kazuo Ishiguro's galactically dull Never Let Me Go (but please, I do so want to let you go). I forced my way through The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (next time, YOU take it). Waded through Wicked, clumped through The Client, I even managed not to "put down" The Horse Whisperer (Get it? "Horse"..."put down"...? OK, I apologize for that one). It was over 10 years ago that I last gave up on a book, and I think it was Evan S Connell's Son of the Morning Star which was actually very well researched but just so disorganized that I couldn't get through it. And now I have to dump Papillon by Henri Charriere, a grand exaggeration (according to online accounts including wikipedia) of a wildly egotistical, "wrongly convicted" French guy who escapes prison several times using money that he has hidden from guards (think: Christopher Walken in Pulp Fiction, although I realize that Papillon came first), in order to one day write a meandering memoir full of his bafflingly bloated tall tales which would be made into a movie starring Steve McQueen and Dustin Hoffman. I understand that, as the story proceeds, Papillon finds ways to celebrate life as he endures various miseries. After suffering through about 100 pages I suddenly realized: I AM PAPILLON, and I am imprisoned in this book, and I need to escape! So there it goes, into the DNF pile, along with Shackelton's South, and Scottoline's Moment of Truth and Crichton's Electronic Life. I leave you with these words of wisdom: "It's as easy as that to drop the chains you've been dragging...'From this moment on you're free.'" - Papillon.
