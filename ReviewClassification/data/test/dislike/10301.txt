I ranked Rick Riordan's The Lighting Thief 5th on my Top Ten Fave Books for 2009, tied with Michael Scott's The Alchemist. I reasoned out that I can't choose which one is better cause both made learning history fun and both have that cool factor reliving the things in the past. Now, I have suspicion that I unknowingly can see the future cause The Red Pyramid is exactly the combination of both books. Is that a good thing? Yes, if it had been well executed. Let's review that sentence: "Yes, if ithad beenwell executed." Yeah, as what my stars above says(don't look up to the sky dumbass, I mean the rating stars.), it is not an awesome book.Its given that Egyptian History is not as fascinating as the Greek and Roman History but egyptian culture has that sense of mystery that Riordan could have played. I didn't get the Egyptian feel to it at all. The existence of the egyptian gods in the book is not that cool either. Thoth playing Rock Band is not as cool as Ares riding the Big Bike or Horus being cranky is not as funny as Dionysius being stubborn. The whole god thing is like just for the sake of having them. You can substitute them with normal people's name and would have still the same effect. The spells are cool. The thing about glowing hieroglyphs after saying the spell is brilliant but I can't see "Ha-di" replacing "Alohomora" for young people getting locked out when they go home late(It's pretty easy to guess why I know this.)The storyline even gets repetitive:Sadie and Caine goes to one place.They start bickering. [Shut up, Sadie and Carter! It's my review:](Read the book to get the sarcasm.)One of them falls asleep and their soul drifts somewhere.Enemy attacks them.They fight(a little).Their company fights alone to buy time for them while they run.They eventually be reunited with that someone.The whole recording thing is distracting most of the times especially the [:] remarks. It would have been better if it's only on the beginning and the end just like in the Lightning Thief.As for the main characters, Sadie and Carter is the least likable sibling I ever read. They are not awesome nor annoying, they are just blah. Forgettable. They continuously throw corny jokes and weak sarcasms. And at some point, their voice on the chapters gets confusing. I have to look up to the top of the page to be sure who is talking. Even towards the end, I still didn't get what kind of personality they have.Now I am unsure if I will still follow this series. Maybe if Riordan will able to redeem himself on The Last Hero(a book that tells about something he is really good at), I will read the second installment for the Kane Chronicles to make up for the time while waiting for the second Heroes of Olympus book. Don't worry Rick Riordan, I still like you and I understand that you, like every writers out there, sometimes just needs the pay check. Peace' :)
