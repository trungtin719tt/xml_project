This book would have gotten one star, except for the fact that I actually enjoyed reading about the slow, tandem recovery of the horse and his rider.What I DIDN'T enjoy was the main character, Annie. I can honestly say I disliked her intensely. She drags her family along by the nose, so certain that EVERYTHING SHE DOES is the best solution for everything, and the fact that the author makes her decisions work somehow makes the character even more irritating. She comes across as self-centered, more concerned with "fixing" her daughter and her horse than actually caring for them.Okay, that last bit probably isn't fair; it's been a while since I read the book, so I may be remembering my annoyance with the character more than the character herself. Regardless, she runs roughshod over everyone, and then seems willing to throw it all away for someone who struck me as a male fantasy about a female's fantasy version of the ultimate "sensitive guy". And then? The ending. Oh dear, the ending. I can't believe Annie's family was even speaking to her at that point, but again, she seemed to believe that everyone was just going to go along with what SHE really wanted anyway.My sister says the movie is MUCH better. It would have to be.
