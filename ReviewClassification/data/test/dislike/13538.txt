This book is so pointless, you could read the chapters in random order and probably not feel like you'd missed much. This marks my second and final attempt to read it. I almost made it to the halfway point this time. If you lovedThe Great Gatsby, don't get your hopes up for this one to be anything close to that good. You'll be disappointed.
