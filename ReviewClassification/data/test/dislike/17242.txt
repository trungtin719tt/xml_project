...Why did I even bother?Never mind how bad theTwilighttrilogy is already, this book just seemed like a fast and easy way for Stephanie Meyer to rake in some money without having to think up an original plot or complex characters. This book was terrible and I'll never read it again, the only redeeming quality about it was the nice graphic of the hourglass on the front cover.
