I'm heading for Paris on a work related trip in a few weeks so I thought I'd get in the mood by dipping into papa. BIG MISTAKE. I guess you had to be there. This is nothing but a bunch of mundane moments strung together by some boring name dropping and squalid hygiene habits.I've never really been a fan of anything other than Ernie's shorter stories and now I remember why. He didn't write briefly for effect. He did it because he didn't really know enough words. It always sounds like he's peeking over his chubby shoulder looking for the camera ready to laud-scape his every thought.A moveable feast is really nothing more than a moveable fat man looking for a meal and some hotties to hang on his precious words.Paris prep is far better satisfied by listening to some Django, sipping on a crema coffee and pondering the reason cuff links are used on french-cuffed shirts.
