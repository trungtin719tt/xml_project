I'm kind of all over the place.1. These books are so freaking big.2. These books are sooooo freaking loooooong.3. A huge portion of this book was very boring4. Wine didn't help at all5. Like almost the last half of this book made up for the boringness in the beginning.. almost6. WHY?!!?I love Jamie and Claire. I just do. Their relationship is basically goals for me. ButDrums of Autumnwas so boring. It almost put me to sleep. Then I tried wine because that usually helps me when books are boring or characters are just plain annoying. Yeah, no amount of wine made this book better to me. Which makes my heart hurt because I really wanted to love this book - but god damn Diana.. WHY!?!I feel like if this was a lot shorter then I would've liked it a lot more. Plus, it kind of felt repetitive - at least to me? It seems like the same storyline.. but again, it could just be me.I'm kind of hesitant to start the next book because I really want to finish this series and fall even more in love with Jamie and Claire's relationship but right now I have no idea what I want to do..
