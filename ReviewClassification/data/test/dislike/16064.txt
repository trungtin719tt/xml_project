In a word: Boring! I tried to get into this book several times, but each attempt was failed. I couldn't even make it all the way through the first chapter without skimming. By chapter eleven I still was not sucked into the world. The characters were very drab and lack-luster. Even the names in this book annoyed me. Kitty, Aggie, Mimi, Trinity, Jack Force, BLISS!! All seemed forced and too cutesy. WAY too much emphasis and description on the clothes the kids were wearing and the streets and architecture of New York. The twin sibling "relationship" between Jack and Mimi seemed slightly inappropriate with scenarios such as 'he was starting to look at that Schuyler girl the way he looks at me' and 'he hugged her to him, pressing his body to hers.' Paraphrasing of course. I dunno, maybe I was reading into something that wasn't there (perhaps trying to make a dull story more interesting?), but something about their brother/sister dynamic just weirded me out a bit. And sadly, those two were the only characters I found even remotely interesting in this story. I will not be continuing with this series.
