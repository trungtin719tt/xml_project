I've finished this book an hour before midnight, going into 2017 with a fuck off curled in my belly. It's a good thing I don't care about new year and don't believe in the "rest of the year will go how you start it" stuff or I would have gone cuntzilla on the author for shatting on my whole year.Last book has ended with a cruel cliffhanger and this one picks up from there. It all goes great, high strung emotions with good writing. The moment hope blossoms, Moning kills it and then starts pissing on it. We wade trough pages after pages of Mac's inner monologue and "special moments" from the first 4 book. I don't hate flashbacks or remembering important moments, but if you have to do it, give us something new besides it, make it original and keep it short for fucks sake. Don't try to boost the volume of your book -which is already too long- with fuckload of rehashing.I said bye felicia to my hopes and kept reading. Then finally came the moment I've been waiting for 4 fucking long books! Mac called herself on her denials, made decisions *even if they were prompted with death cliche, I overlooked that shitty plot liner completely*. She found a second chance, gathered her lady balls and at last we are about to get our Barrons and Mac coupling... What do you think happened? She realized her balls and spine are actually an illusion and pulled a Joffrey.At that point I carefully lowered my tablet -least I break it and screamed inside!I seriously considered DNFing right there, but I had gotten this far and at least wanted to have some questions answered. After everything happened, Mac reverted her cunty little pissant self. Again we got pages upon pages her whiny inner monologue. As if that wasn't enough we got to hear Dani's emo teenager inner monologue.Mac found out an information about herself so we had to hear it in circles. Same shit argued, monologued, written into the dairy and after more pages yet again same information... Denied, considered. And old shit heated up and fed to us.get to the point already rainbow girl! *that's how I picture Mac*If I had the paperback copy of this book, I would have torn off the unnecessary pages as I went to see how many essential ones I'm left with at the end. This drag assed book is 608 pages and if she had a decent editor, it would be 250 pages at most. And that's me being bloody generous! While the way she tied up the story could have been enjoyable, all I was feeling was a deep seated anger so I'm giving only 1 star for the story.The other star is for Barrons. By some miracle, she didn't fuck him up as I feared. He did not turn into sappy git. He was a beast and kept his assholishness till the bitter end. It just became woven with his love/madness. Even tough, I am done with this series due to anger issues, I don't regret reading it. Because Barrons is and probably will be my favourite hot jerk of all time. As for Mac...
