Wait, this is gonna be a series?After the absolute fucking train wreck that was Beautiful Disaster, there is seriously gonna be another one.Excuse me, I've gotta go throw up.What the actual fuck?Well, fuck.Book one was fucked up enough. Now we get book two. This is bound to be EVEN MORE fucked up because - of course - it's from ourbeloveddisgusting, STD ridden male lead, Travis. Travis is a sick fuck. He is psycho. He is a stalker. He is obsessive. He is in dire need of anger management.Dear Travis,Sincerely, Me.Abby. Abby doesn't give a fuck about Travis' controlling nature. She doesn't stand up for herself. She doesn't give a fuck that he bashes the fuck out of people for money. Hell, she bets on his fights. She doesn't care that he has fucked the entire female population and continues to fuck chicks even when she's present. She doesn't even care that he calls her the most God-awful nickname, Pigeon. She lets Travis control her. And I'm telling you all right now, THAT'S NOT FUCKING NORMAL.Dear Abby,Simply because you're SO infuriating,I'll do it for you. Kill you, that is. But hey, you should thank me. I mean, it's only a matter of time before Travis bashes the fuck out of you. My killing you will actuallysaveyou. So, you're welcome.Sincerely, Me.Abby would be better off filing a restraining order. Her relationship with Travis is never going to last. He is FAR too controlling. He barely gives her space to breathe. But hey, he fucked her up. At the end of book one, she fucking ENCOURAGES him to BASH UP HER FUCKING FRIENDS. WHAT.THE.FUCK.THIS IS NOT FUCKING NORMAL.I AM SO FUCKING ANGRY.I AM TOO ANGRY FOR WORDS.Basically, this is going to be the same book, just from someone elses POV. There will be all the elements from the first book; sex, alcohol, gambling, more sex, beating the fuck out of people etc, etc.[image error]I have one last thing to say...Congratulations Miss. McGuire. Yourlovelysorry excuse for a book got picked up by a publisher, made into a trilogy, and movie rights sold. Your absolutely disgusting behaviour has been rewarded. So for that, I congratulate you.But I'll let you in on a little secret... Karma is a real bitch.
