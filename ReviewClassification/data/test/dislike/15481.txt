It's appropriate that I should review this novel on the 65th anniversary of the successful test of the first atom bomb in Alamogordo, New Mexico.On the Beachis set in what was the near future to British-Australian author Nevil Shute, writing in 1957: 1963, approximately a year after World War III. The northern hemisphere has been devastated by nuclear war, and those in the southern hemisphere wait for the nuclear fallout to reach them. The story follows the lives of several Australians and one American in Melbourne, Australia, which is destined to be the last major city left alive on the planet before its inhabitants, too, die of radiation poisoning.What the novel does, it does extremely well. It draws the reader into the lives of these individuals as they live out their final months, weeks, days, and hours, and in so doing it brings the tragic waste of their deaths into high relief. The slow, inexorable march of the fallout, and the way the characters deal (or refuse to deal) with it is played out soberly, and with restraint. This is not the story of heroic leaders fighting until their final breaths, or last-minute attempts to save humanity; it's the story of husbands and wives and sons and daughters and widowers and would-be lovers who are powerless to stop the inevitable, and so accept it as best they can. As a "What if?" scenario, and an overt warning, the novel is very effective.I was, however, expecting a wider range of reactions, from religious reawakenings to last-minute scientific schemes. As the last surviving city, Melbourne didn't seem to be messy enough - socially, politically, religiously, literally - by the end. The characters behaved in surprisingly similar ways, and the world continued on with a coziness that sometimes felt contrived. Many of the most fascinating aspects of the post-apocalyptic scenario were only vaguely mentioned in passing, and I would've loved to see more of these ideas examined and explored. But perhaps Shute's narrow focus makes his point: in the end, with so much warning and so few ways to combat what is coming, people ultimately will just carry on, quietly accept, and then die.As a book on the aftermath of nuclear war, it does not rival some of its contemporaries, notably the grand vision of Walter M. Miller'sA Canticle for Leibowitz(1960) and the haunting power of Mordecai Roshwald'sLevel 7(1959), both of which I think are better novels. That said, I appreciateOn the Beach's place in history, and I'm glad I read this quiet, understated, and sensitive work.
