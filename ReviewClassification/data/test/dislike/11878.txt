Some might really like the story, but there were too many times the plot read as if it was tossed together like a bad salad &amp; cheap tricks were used to get our heroine in &amp; out of trouble. Worse, new issues &amp; fixes magically appear/disappear, while parents conveniently do the same. Worst of all, the end is a super cliff hanger, the kind that screams "Read my next book or you're doomed to never know how it turns out."It's a shame. The book had some redeeming features &amp; could have been a good story. It just wasn't constructed or told very well. Some of the trimmings were truly imaginative, but I doubt I'll look to hard for any other books by her. I was hoping this was an early book, but it seems that she's prolific enough that this is a pen name. Her forte seems to be YA novels, so maybe that's why I don't care for this as much. If I run across another, I'll probably read it to see if I like it any better, so she didn't completely turn me off.
