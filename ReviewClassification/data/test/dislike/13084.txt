You know what's annoying? The fact that all of these people waste they're time posting on here about how much they hate the series and blah blah blah. Obviously you like it enough to read every book they publish, and then even more to log onto this website and write 9 paragraphs about how much you hate it. THEN search to see the next book, and write a review about how much it's going to suck. Let me help you all out. NO ONE CARES. I don't wanna see that you think the series is dragging out. I am actually stoked that its not over. Id rather not read twilight wanna bes over and over because that's what most series are turning into. Fitzpatrick isn't running dry, she's taking the story to all of these different places. I could see if she was repetitive, or if there was nothing exciting going on, but that's not the case at all!So anyways, I'm excited about this book! Lol.
