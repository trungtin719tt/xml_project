One day in Geometry, one of my classmates was raving about this book. Now, she wasn't really an avid reader, so I figured that hey, if she loved it and it got her to finish the book, it's probably pretty good.Fast forward more years than I'd care to admit and I've finally read it. Oh my. I am so, so disappointed. I understand that a lot of people love this book--and that's great! I'm not attacking you or judging you or anything. I'm just saying that I really, really didn't like Cold Sassy Tree.The overall feel of the book was so melodramatic, yet unfocused, that it was really jarring to read. Things would just happen BAM! for shock value, I suppose, and then everything would go right back to the way it was. There was a particularly annoying tendency for the narrator (thus also the author) to say something like, "but I didn't know then that everything would change" or something along those lines. Honey, that's not really how I like my foreshadowing.Also, no one in this book was particularly likeable. I suppose we're meant to like Grandpa and Miss Love, and Will Tweedy, the narrator, but I was really put off by the way they just go along with the hypocrisy of their fellow townsfolk. They realize that their neighbors are nasty hypocrites, but oh well, what can you do? Gah.Finally, I really take issue with this being seen as the sort of "successor" to To Kill a Mockingbird. To my dismay and anger, I read a few reviews a while back about TKAM that described it as juvenile and not very well-written. Please. TKAM is so spot-on, so meaningful, and created such wonderful characters that it is leagues away from Cold Sassy Tree. Plus, besides being set in the South, they don't have similar storylines at all. Although I did get the feeling that Burns was trying to do a sort of follow-up to TKAM. No. Just no.So you may like it, you may love it, or you may not. Your mileage may indeed vary. Boy howdy.
