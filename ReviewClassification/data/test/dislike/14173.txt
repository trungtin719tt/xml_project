Call me a narc, I just can't empathize. Believe me, I put myself in her shoes. I understand that there are drug users who have reasons for taking cocaine, but what's her problem? One, her dad is a big jerkbutt. ...And that's about it. I can imagine worse situations in a second. If I were her, I would call my mom and beg her to take me home. That, and call Child Services to inspect him. End of story. Also, nobody forced her to snort. It was all her stupid mind that chose to take the step because some dude was super hot and was nice to her (Twilight, anyone?). So what horrible event prompted Bree to snort? Nothing, except that she was an angst-y and shallow teen who only cared about looks. This girl lost all of my respect from the beginning. I'm sorry about that.
