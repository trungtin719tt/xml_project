I was disappointed in this book because I loved the three before it so much. The first 3, it only took me 200 pages at the very most for me to be completely absorbed and unable to put the books down to even sleep. But this one, it took nearly 600 pages for me to feel like it was starting to get interesting. And much to my dismay the feeling did not last. I struggled throught the last 100 pages as the story seemed to drag on unnecessarily. I really want to finish the series but after this book, I'm not apt to jump into the next 1000+ page story any time soon.Reading other reviews of this book, I can see why people don't really care for Brianna. She didn't bother me that much, but her and Roger's story is nowhere near as captivating as Claire and Jamie's.
