This is your classic page-turner and bestseller. Cliched, predictable both in terms of plot and characters. Uninspiring rehashing of themes like overcoming tragedy and adversity; the contrast between the ruthless, stress-filled corporate environment and the simpler, idealised fulfillment found in a ranching/farming life. New York magazine editor supermom just has to go over to Wyoming to find meaning and of course end up the arms of our well muscled, handsome cowboy with his homespun philosophy and wisdom. The sad fact is that I, along with millions of other people not only bought the book but consumed it - not read but consumed - and in one four and half hour sitting no less. If you have a copy, do yourself a favour - save the time and dump the book now, before you too fall prey to this hogwash.
