This book is much more entertaining if you read it as a "historical novel" rather than trying to read it as a religious text. Honestly, because of the sheer volume of anachronistic errors contained in Joseph Smith's book, even trying to read it as a novel is taxing.The Book of Mormon is set in North America in the first century. Before I get "flamed" I would like to point out three of the more glaring anachronistic errors:1) Horses (actually brought to the Americas by Europeans hundreds of years later)2) Wheat (actually brought to the Americas by Europeans hundreds of years later)3) The book of Mormon claims the existence ofover 150first century"cities"(not "towns" or "villages" or "settlements" but "cities") in North America. No evidence has EVER been found to substantiate the existence of even ONE of these cities.There are also major battles recorded in the Book of Mormon and, again, NO evidence has EVER been found to substantiate even ONE of those battles. This book is probably most correctly classified as Science Fiction/Fantasy.
