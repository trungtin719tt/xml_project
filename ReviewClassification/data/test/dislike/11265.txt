The House of Sand and Fog was a book that I had high expectations for. The reviews for this book have been above average, and (which I didn't find out until after I read) it was chosen for Oprah's Book Club. While I typically act high brow towards anything that is touted by the O, she has chosen to like some classics that I have, 'On the Road' being one of them. Though I don't know how the typical Oprah watcher could really get in to this... that is not the point.Anyways, back to Dubas' book. I did appreciate his use of the Iranian colonel, a troubled man from a violent regime who is not mentally mature enough to see his own failings. Dubas' shaping of this character is actually poetic, though frustrating for a reader who learns that this negligence of responsibility is realistically in-defeatable in people who have committed human rights horrors. Behrani is never a hero to the reader, or to me, but if weighed against Kathy Nicolo, becomes the moral winner.I was not at once convinced by Kathy. Her character is so unchanging, so immature, unable to learn from mistake after mistake that you can not like her. But how can she not learn? Behrani shows growth throughout the novel. If anything, Kathy shows a degeneration. I do appreciate the moments of internal struggle she shows, but it is hardly enough to redeem her.I don't think Dumas took much of a leap with the character development, or the plot development. From the rave reviews I've heard of this book, I was expecting much better. To echo a post I read on GoodReads, this is the equivalent of a Beach Read that doesn't need to be brought to the beach. Little thought needed, easy to flip through, doesn't affect reader. Blah.
