The hype machine worked! With a delay.The Passagewas a publishing sensation of 2010 - cleverly marketed asThe StandmeetingThe Road, its gorgeous cover (will you just look at these trees!) immediately caught attention of readers, and even its bulk was not discouraging - after all, who does not enjoy getting caught up in a good novel? Publishing details topped the cake: Cronin received a $5 million advance payment: $3.5 for the publishing rights toThe Passageand two planned sequel (in North America alone), and Riddley Scott bought the rights to film the novel for $1,5 million. A relatively unknown novelists whose previous output consists of just two slim novels -Mary and O'Neil: A Novel in StoriesandThe Summer Guest- both of which having nothing to do with end of the world, vampires, infections, and an epic on a grand scale. Where did this surprising development came from? I have no idea, but apparently this goose lays eggs of gold. Stephen King sealed the deal, giving the novel a glowing recommendation:"It has the vividness that only epic works of fantasy and imagination can achieve...read this book and the ordinary world disappears"(King also blurbedHannibalas being better than bothRed DragonandThe Silence of the Lambs- I can understand much but I genuinely have no idea where he got that idea from). And did you know that the author of this huuuge novel with vampires is a professor of English atRiceUniveristy in Texas? Get it?Rice? LOL!Although the novel has been compared toThe Stand, I see another comparison which would be way more apt; Robert McCammon'sSwan Song, another gargantuan post-apocalyptic epic. UnlikeThe Stand, McCammon's novel has largely failed the test of time. Although one cannot deny the author his efforts and ambition, it remains deeply rooted in the 80's fear of a nuclear war - which is not essentially a bad thing. What is bad is that it's populated by cartoony characters and sugary sentimentality, with little or no ambiguity. Still, there is a certain merit toSwan Songresulting from nostalgia - it's the epitome of the bulky paperback novel which once was what captured our attention and kept us reading late into the night when we were younger and did not mind its flaws, captivated instead by the story which still had time to get old and cliched. Now, the Huge Post-Apocalyptic Epics are a thing of the past - most novels concerned with life after the Big Bad are much slimmer, and adressed to young adults. And here, in 2010, Justin Cronin brought it back to life! How could we not get excited? We still remember readingThe Standyears ago and hoped for at least a glimpse of that feeling.The trouble is that this is the 21st century - the author would be hard pressed to come up with new ideas instead of relying on all familiar plot devices and developments...and well, he doesn't. The novel opens with a weak first act, consisting mainly of a stereotypical story of a young mother and her troubles; eventually it gets so bad that she has to sell her body, and then she leaves her daughter at a convent. There is also a B-movie like episode of scientists investigating some wild occurences in South America. Then two cops show up on the stage and have to take the girl who was left at the convent and deliver her to the feds - for some unknown reason (probably because she's a messiah character). The author likes backstories - instead of letting these characters act and come to life, he dumps pages after pages of their past on the poor reader's conscience - care damnit! It does not help that all the characters are bland as hell - the child with hidden powers, the good cop/bad cop routine, an innocent prisoner and I swear that there's even a Magical Negro in there and this hasn't been cool since John Coffey. But something finally starts to happen - the promised apocalypse is sloowly starting to boil!Aaaaaaaand that is the moment the novel takes a surprising leap! Around quarter through it the reader is suddenly and unexpectedly catapulted into the future, and introduced to a completely new set of characters who are left in the world AFTER the apocalypse happened. The fireworks went off, and we weren't even there! The post-apocalypic world itself I did not find to be very interesting - anyone even vaguely familiar with the themes the author approaches will find little, if any, surprises in this part of the text. While the first part of the book manages to maintain at least a mild sort of interest in the reader, the rest of the book is meandering and unfocused, never gaining any real momentum.In over a thousand pages periliously little happens, and the narrative feels stretched to the maximum - and to top that any possible violent or sexual contentThe Passageis consciously toned down by the author, probably to met the PG13 and reach the younger audience. This is reflected in the relative simplicity of the storyline, complete with melodramatic expressions in all the right places ("Oh, How he loved her").And at the end of the novel there's a giant cliffganger, meaning that the whole thing was just a set up for the other two novels - the sequel has just been published. Loose ends will probably be tied in the subsequent installments - but to take a hardly original idea and stretch into a sprawling and overlong novel which barely accomplishes anything on its own makes me not be at all excited about reading them.
