Recipe for Bridges of Madison County Firestarters1. melt 20 oz. parafin in 4 1/2 quart slow cooker set on low--should take about 20 minutes.2. set several sheets of newspaper on kitchen floor next to slow cooker.3. Tear pages out of binding--I find about seven at a time works best. Discard binding.4. Crumple each page individually--you can do it two or three at a time, but recipe will go farther if you take the time to crumple each page individually.5. With tongs, dip each crumpled page into the parafin. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds. Remove.6. Carefully set dipped,crumpled pages on newspaper to dry.7. Continue steps 4 and 5 until all pages have been dipped.8. If preferred, repeat steps 4 and 5 to get a thicker coat of parafin on each page.9. VERY IMPORTANT: Carefully dispose of left over parafin in an empty coffee can and unplug slow cooker.NOTE: the next few meals you make in your slow cooker might not taste very good.9. Once all pages have been coated, place them together in attractive baskets next to your fireplace.10. Each time you use your fireplace, place a few crumpled pages of The Bridges of Madison County on your logs, ignite with flame source and enjoy watching them burn!
