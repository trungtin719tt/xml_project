The book, made into a popular miniseries in 1983, follows the events leading up to the US entry into WWII by following one Navy family.I thought the depiction of military life was spot-on. In particular, the concept of "it's not what you know, but who knows you." I saw one reviewer critique the many opportunities given to Pug just because the President encountered him once and trusted him. But this actually resonated with me - with many of those "big wigs," when they find a person, regardless of rank or circumstance, that they can trust...they tend to go to that person more than you'd expect. "Roosevelt liked [Pug] because he was knowledgeable, got things done, and kept his mouth shut." And Pug proved his worth repeatedly.It was well researched, and the characters were interesting, credible, and appealing (even Hitler, Stalin, and Mussolini. And yes, Pug interacts with all of them), but wow, was it long. At one point, I felt I had been reading for the actual duration of WWII. There were whole sections "cut" from a German General's book that Pug translated. Those were such a slog I ended up skimming them.Overall, a decent read...but it only deserved 498 pages of my reading budget. Not 898 pages.
