It was ok, I guess.Before Kate Daniels it was Anita Blake. However, it is one of those rare instances where the copy cat is much better than the original. Anita is a raiser of the undead and killer of vampires. She is coerced to help a powerful vampire queen and to investigate the murder of several powerful vampires. The main problem with the book was its heroine. She was so unlikable, so proud of herself that she does no drink, doesn't have sex and is such a good Christian. Oh, she is so judgemental. Taking in consideration that the series will turn into a porn fest after book 6-7 I call her a hypocrite. Also, the humour and the fight scenes did not work for me. Kate Daniels, on the other hand is a fun, likeable, kick ass character. Even the character Ilona Andrews copied from Guilty Pleasures, Rafael, is so much better.I might try the next one in the series but I am in no rush to do so. This was one of the first UF-PR books so it might wort a try if you are interested how it all began.
