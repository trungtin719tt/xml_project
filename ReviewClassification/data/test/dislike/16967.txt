The book tells of a boy who happens upon a mob lawyer who commits suicide. But before he commits suicide, he divulges information on where the body of the murdered Senator was hidden by his mob boss. Fearing reprisal by the mob or the FBI for lying, he hires a lawyer to get him out of this mess.I only slightly dislike this book because the premise of the book is weak. I could not get over the fact that the kid could have avoided the whole suspense by telling the FBI the truth about the body of the Senator. In that way, he and his immediate family could have gone into the Witness Protection Program and considering his mother's miserable job, the WPP would actually be step up from his current life. Also, his lawyer could have advised him to tell the FBI so the kid would be in WPP instead of a possible target of the mafia. The excitement of the book did not have purpose to it so this is the reason the book sucked.And what is wrong with Assistant Attorney General, he already knew the kid was not talking because he was scarred for his life and the life of his family so could he not cut a deal with the FBI to expedite the WPP?What is wrong with the mother? Sure it would be a hastle to be in the WPP but their lives are already in danger! So, the WPP would actually be safer for them instead of having their identity known currently.This is an idiotic and unbelievable plot.I guess the only redeeming quality about this book is the relationship between the kid and the 52 year old lawyer in which they both alternated being the adult in the relationship. For that, I will give this book 1.5.
