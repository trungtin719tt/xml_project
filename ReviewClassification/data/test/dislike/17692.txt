Please don't name your childEver. Ever.Before I even dove into this book, I got the "good luck". That being said, I was hesitant as fuck to read this book. Pretty sure I thought the first one was meh and okay but this one worked for a specific challenge.. so I decided to suffer once again.Blue Moonis one of those books you should see in a blue moon. Or never. Whichever your preference is - mine would be on the never side. Something is obviously going on between Ever and Damen (no, not the brother in vampire diaries) and I just didn't care. Sure, she's growing more powerful and shit.. and he's like dying basically. Yet, I gave zero fucks all around. This whole relationship and romance between them just bores me to death.Then she tries to save him from whatever mystical illness he has.. and she is just a trier guys. Is that even a word? Oh well, going with it. If Ever was ever given the choice to pick a decision out of two presented in front of her (one labeled good and the other terrible) she will always pick the wrong decision. No matter what.Overall, the book series is over right? It was always a duology? Don't tell me otherwise.
