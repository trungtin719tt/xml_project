Well written? Yes. Good story line? Yes. Creative? Yes. Worth reading? No.The problem I have with this book (and many of the Stephen King books I've attempted to read) is that everything in it is presented as being mean, petty, twisted, angry, cruel, etc.When I read, I'm willing to wade through sad, oppresive, heart-wrenching difficulties with the main characters if necessary, but ultimately, I read fiction in the hopes that it is going to help me feel good about life, forget my troubles, forget how awful we can be to each other. This book takes all the worst of humanity and shoves it bluntly in your face. Finally, I just couldn't stand the thought of picking the book up to be brutalized by Stephen King's and Peter Staub's writing again. So I didn't. I'm so glad this was a library book, rather than a purchase.
