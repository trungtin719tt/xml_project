2.5 starsI know I'm going to make a lot of people angry here but...I really wasn't a fan of this book.The first half was alright. Kyle's narrative was easy to follow and his personality and emotions seemed pretty authentic. I really liked the idea behind the story: hot self-absorbed jerk gets turned into a beast so that his looks match his personality. Awesome. Love it. This is how I spent my teenage years--wishing that this same thing would happen to all the douche bags I knew.I also love Beauty and the Beast stories. I go out of my way to find these type of stories all the time and I'm rarely unsatisfied. Beauty and the Beast is a classic, so imagine my disappointment when I read this book.It had so much potential.The second half is what really made me discontented. At first Kyle is that typical good looking jerk. He fits his stereotype very well and he is easy to hate because of how much he looks down on other people for their looks. He thinks very highly of himself and makes other people feel terrible. I hated him, I really did, but I liked how I could get behind his character. His personality, emotions, relationships, feelings, reactions, were all very authentic and made sense with his character. Even when he became a beast he made sense, because what he felt and how he reacted would probably be how anyone put in that situation would react.The second half of the story, after Lindy came to his house, changed all of this. Suddenly, his feelings took a 180 and he wasn't the same character anymore. He didn't just change the way he thought about and saw the world. His entire personality changed along with his emotions. He fell in love way too quickly, as does the other main character. Two years is supposed to pass in this time frame, but it feels more like two weeks. The writing in the second half was just super rushed and the characters needed more time to come to a gradual change. I am all for character development, but that's just what it lacked: development. The writing just seemed a bit sloppy, like the writer was in a hurry to finish the novel and didn't take the time let the audience digest the growth in the characters. So many details were left out. Details that were needed to make the reading experience enjoyable.Now let's talk spoilers:There was some stuff that really rubbed me the wrong way and made me a little bit angry. The first thing is that Adrian was watching Lindy sleep, without her knowing. He let himself into her room and watched her. I just felt so sad for Lindy at that moment, because if I were her I would feel so violated. And he doesn't just do this one. He does in quite a few times. If he isn't watching her sleep in person, he's watching her through the magic mirror, spying on her. I just felt extremely uncomfortable about this. It teaches young girls and boys that this type of behaviour is okay, that there is nothing wrong about it, which can be very dangerous. Words shape people's ideas and beliefs, and I would hate to think that some girl someday might run into a situation like this, and think there is nothing wrong with it. This type of behaviour is not okay, and we need to steer young men away from this.The other thing I really didn't like was how easily Lindy came to trust Adrian. He kidnapped her and blackmailed her father. Who would trust someone after this? Yes, Adrian eventually allows her to leave, but for a long time she is his prisoner, though Adrian doesn't see it this way. One week is not a long enough time to come to trust someone. And to fall in love with them? I just can't see this happening. To make this more believable I would have needed to see a lot more scenes where Lindy and Adrian just talked and opened themselves up to each other emotionally. I would have liked to see them talk about their struggles more and reveal some secrets to each other that they had never told anybody. This would have helped with the transition from hate to love.The last thing that really bothered me was how corny Adrian became after Lindy showed up. He started thinking things like "my love" and speaking to her like he was from the 18th century. This just seemed out of place because of his earlier characterization. I know it was supposed to come off as sweet and romantic, but I just felt uncomfortable. The author gives us an explanation for this change in language: all the classic books Adrian reads in his time as a beast, but again there is not enough time to make this transformation. One day he's thinking and speaking normal, and then all of a sudden he's not. I just didn't buy it, and found that this was the point where I realized I did not like the book.Will I read more of Alex Flinn's stuff? Probably, at some point, because I like the ideas in her warped fairy tales. If I see one of her books in a used store some day, I'll pick it up. But I'm not going to go out of my way to track down her work.Maybe I would have liked this book better if I was still thirteen, but being an adult, as well as an English major, has made me more picky about what I read. Because of this, Beastly just wasn't the book for me.
