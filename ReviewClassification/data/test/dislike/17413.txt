So, I liked House of Leaves but wouldn't call it great or brilliant. I liked the concept of a cache of papers found detailing a possibly ficticious film about a house with impossible dimensions and the maze of mind bogglingly large size in its closet. It was interesting but at its core it was a thin story propped up by gimmicks and pretentious nonsense. I understand that the informational footnotes were supposed to make it seem more real and the rambling narrator's footnotes were supposed to show his descent into madness while he compiled the work but the whole thing felt like the author was saying "Look at me! I'm ever so clever!" Strip away the gimmicks and you have a haunted house that's a little thin.
