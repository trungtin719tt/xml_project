Please note the shelves this book is on: It's much more "junk" than "fun." I received this as a gift, and it says on the cover, "The glorious best seller byRichard Bachauthor ofJonathan Livingston SeagullandOne", which I think pretty much sums it up. The author's note in the beginning is pretentious drivel about "I never wanted to write another book again because it's just so hard, but these characters and this story were just begging to be let out of my head..." Waah. The book isn't even 200 pages, and the print is not tiny. You can finish it in an afternoon (he probably did). It's really predictable, and I could get the same basic idea reading a book about Buddhism without having to deal w/ the BS plot. I'm trying to find one to link to, but really, pretty much ANY book about Buddhism (orBuddhist meditation) will give you the same ideas but better articulated. Which I guess is kind of funny, since the person who gave me the book gave it to me because she loves the message, and she's an observant Christian (albeit an extremely cool, funny, and open-minded observant Christian).An excerpt from the "Messiah's Handbook" (oracular book within the book):You arenever given a wishwithout also being given thepower to make it true.You mayhave to work for it,however.As a matter of fact, hey. You want to read a BETTER book about a "reluctant messiah" (not that better is really saying much) that'll give you the same basic message in a way more satisfying way?Try this.
