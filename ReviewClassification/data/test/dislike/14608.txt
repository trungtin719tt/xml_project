I always felt that this was one of those books written for women who are menopausal and in a marriage that dried up and need to hold on to a fantasy that they don't need to actually do anything in order to make their life better - it will just happen. It will just drive up to their house and hump them and it will be ok because their marriage sucks and they decide to stay in said crap marriage rather than run off - because running off would be cliche. Happiness is cliche and should be shunned.ARGH. I normally have a love for books that cause any sort of reaction in me - I think it's good when characters can evoke a strong response in a reader. But there are limits - and this book crossed the line for me.I think the other thing that pissed me off - other than the writing and the content - was that it was actually a short story that they wrote in a small book in large print. It's a study in how to stretch a short story into a "novel".
