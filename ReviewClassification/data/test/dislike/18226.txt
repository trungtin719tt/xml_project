I don't understand why I can't just give up on Nicholas Sparks. I keep reading his books even though there has yet to be one I really liked. 80% of the time I spend reading his stuff I'm bored out of my mind. I guess I'm just a glutton for punishment. This book was quite possibly the most blah book of his I've read to date. I don't understand why I can't just fall in love with him like everybody else! I'm sure it's me that's the problem. I'm defective. Sorry
