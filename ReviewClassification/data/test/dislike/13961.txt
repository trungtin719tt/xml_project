This will be just me ranting instead of writing a review. But it has a few spoilers.We pick up the story 4 years after the events of Halfway To The Grave. Cat is now Commander Cat (lawl), and she leads a special government team. She broke up with Bones and hasn't seen him since. She was never subtle to begin with, but now Cat is so goddamn hot, it seems like everybody around her is constantly trying to get in her pants. In the first book, Bones provided enough distractions to keep things interesting, but he's nowhere to be seen in the first half of the book. *yawns*Cat is bordering on pathetic; she took the same last name as her former lover, she got the same tattoo on her hip, she hasn't slept with anybody since Bones and she spends her days snapping nasty comments at people, and thinking of Bones and his tongue. Obviously she is completely oblivious to all the admirers she has, because that's what a Mary Sue is supposed to do, right? Tate has to spell it out for her. And even then she doesn't get it.The way Cat and Bones meet again is just one big followup of convenient plot devices. Cat has a best friend now, who gets married to a computer genius, completely out of the blue. (she is probably on honeymoon for the rest of the book because we don't hear from her again) And you already know this genius is going to be very useful some day (more like 10 chapters later). And you already know who is going to show up at the wedding. Only a massive amount of self-restraint causes Cat to keep herself in check when she sees Bones standing there in front of her, at the wedding. Which is completely out of character, since it's kind of her trademark. For example, when she meets the first vampire Bones made. Which is of course a woman. Who is in love with Bones. Who tries to scare Cat away by commenting on the massive amounts of sex they had over the past centuries. Result = Catfight.Of course, they hook up again, and then I finally got to read the famous Chapter 32 my friends kept talking about. WTF was up with that? I kept thinking about pigs, becauseMorganonce told me they have 30-minute orgasms. That's pretty much what Cat went through for an entire night. With an audience. And with Bones boldly going where no man has ever gone before. Ick. I'm afraid to pick up the next book, because I'm positive the words 'golden' and 'shower' are going to pop up in the same sentence.I'm not saying I didn't have fun while I was reading this but there was just too much stupid in there. Things like Cat 'forgetting' she was half naked while she paraded around for everybody to see, the completely ridiculous impromptu marriage (basically they cut their hands, slapped them together and said "by my blood, let's do this shit"), the OMFGICANTLIVEWITHOUTYOU romance... That and about 409 other little things that got on my nerves. After a while I was thinking "If I see her 'palming' one more goddamn silver knife I'm going to slap a bitch. Because that's basically all she does, besides being a foulmouthed bitch to everybody and shagging Bones. Meh.
