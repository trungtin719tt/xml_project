Everyone told me I'd love this book, then they all told me I SHOULD love this book. I read all the blurbs about how wonderful, astounding, amazing, unbelievable it was.You know, I actually wanted to like it. I was looking for a good book. I was hoping for an absorbing story that would draw me in, where I could sink into the story.Alas, this wasn't it. I forged my way through a good part of the book, after all sometimes books start slowly and then "take off". This one didn't. I finally skimmed my way to the end and finished, sadder but wiser. I just didn't care for it, in other words, I didn't think it was astounding, amazing, absorbing, incredible...or even very good. To each their own, if you liked it (and I see many do/did) I'm happy for you, but it's not for me. In my opinion it's several hours of my life I'll never get back.Can't really endorse this one, but it is I'm sure a matter of taste. This one didn't pull me in or appeal to me as it does some of you. Sorry.
