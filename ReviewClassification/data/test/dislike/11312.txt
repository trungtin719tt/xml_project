"Like, a lot of people like me and all, I'm important and shit, this god also does. Oh yeah, I have, like, three hawt guys after me. I seriously can't believe he - insert one of three guys name - would do that! It's his fault! Enough loving me already! Oh wait, I forgot, this sick thing happened, *insert spoiler* Oh my gawd! " Well, that's my perspective on Miss so-effing-beautiful-high-and-mighty-mary-sue Zoey this book. Cue head banging.I was thinking that since the last book wasn't very impressive, this would make up for it. I mean, seriously, I get that there are some fillers or at least one bad book in a series, but this has got to be one of the worst. Let me rephrase that: There are some-to-little interesting developments regarding the plot and where Zoey was left of last time and another twist. Sadly, all this takes a backseat (well, at least they mention it). Why? Because Zoey is in a freaking love square and she can't decide who to choose. *gasp* She, the important one, with a shitload of problems involving danger, can't concentrate because something happened (I thought it was kinda okay, not bad) and she can't choose the right guy! Zoey, we have a word for you, chica, with troubles with the amount of guys you have and how quickly you switch: it's called being loose and a slut. I can't even say emotional development because while the main character *kind of* gets things sometime, I would expect her to - oh I don't know - mature a little after 5+ books? Nope. And while it is cool to see other POV's in this book, it seemed suddenly out place because the authors just threw them in for the sake of what? Understanding? View points? It didn't seem right after 5+ books on just Zoey's view (unfortunately). It wasn't much use anyways since it was a recap of actions that already happened and how they viewed it. And it was pretty much about "I can't believe - Zoey! - Oh no! Maybe this -" It was messed up and to suddenly add more later in the series? Incoherent andWell, moving on the who-to-choose (I swear, at least lessen it to two, don't decide on a third), there was this pretty awesome development on the story and I liked the direction the authors were taking it. But, man, the pace of the story was uneven with it that the authors weren't able to execute it properly. I just hope they concentrate on that more then Zoey's "love dilemma". I like the concept of the story, but I just don't like the round-about way the authors are taking and focusing on lesser problems. Remember the main focus in the last book? There is a completely useless side-plot that distracts everything and is an obstacle; the series is starting to drag the plot line. And since I'm already used to the over-the-top use of slang, I'll skim that part. And what about other side characters? What happened to them here? My love for Stevie Ray and Aprodite grew. I prefer them as the main characters instead. I actually liked Stevie Ray's part of the story and her POV. Also, WTF happened that made others whiny and unlikable? I already find Zoey annoying (dude, you have to take the blame sometimes), and including other characters that are going downhill because of - you guess it - Zoey. Seems like the authors are doing switches on others too. Crap, well there goes the rest of the series.Suffice to say, something plot-wise does happen to Zoey that took a turn. Well, I can sympathize a bit on that. Kinda sad. Reminded me of the risks and all and will the plot actually go straight-forward instead of a detour and off the cliff? Hmm, I'm seriously giving up this - although the ending where some things were redeemed was cool and I think hopefully some ties are done - though the cliff hanger had me hesitating. The love square is kinda done. There are some characters I want to keep reading. The actual plot is weakening but I'd like to see what happens after a side-problem is complete. Blah, forget it, I'm done. I'll just ask my friends if it gets worse or we'll just snark from the campus library.
