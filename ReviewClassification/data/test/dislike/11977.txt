Night, was possibly one of the worst books I've ever read. I was suprised when I logged on to find, Five star reviews of this book. Yeah, so it was written by a holocaust survivor. It doesn't make it well written. From a literary standpoing, purely. It was terrible. As Ms. Hawley would say, It lacked sentence variation. Maybe it was better when it was written in German? Maybe he should have let a "professional" writer, write it for him. I'm not bashing him, or his writing. Kind of. His writing not him. Too me I felt as if it was written by a 10 year old, who repeats everything. And then... And then this... Oh, and then... I mean, the holocaust was and is so tragic, it hardly makes a good setting for a story. And yeah, that was his experience. And his literary inspiration. But maybe we just shouldn't be required to read it. And I also learned it was on Oparah's book club list. WHAT!? But anywho. My opinion seems to be the only one of it's sort.Maybe I'm just wrong?
