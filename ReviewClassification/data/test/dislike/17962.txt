A somewhat awful page-turner:A page-turner I'm embarrassed to have finished. The plot in this exciting thriller rolls along, almost too swiftly, but ultimately left me unfulfilled. The author never fleshes out his world or the characters inhabiting it. They often lack motivation for their actions and are little more than mere vehicles for the plot, whose elements fit *too well* together. The central love story is so trite its laugh-out-loud funny, and while I realize Mr. Weeks met his wife at a very young age, we'd need a little more explanation for our hero's affection for a girl than that they knew each other when they were young. This element ruined the ending for me, and Weeks showed absolutely no capability of handling complex emotions. The book reads like a role-playing game with very maudlin moments thrown in to give it a depth which is beyond this author's reach.This is one of those books where everything falls into place nicely, the characters find out what they need to find out at exactly the precise time for the plot to progress, and every single character introduced ends up being central to the plot if not biologically related to the other characters.I will say there were a few wonderful scenes, especially in the first half, but Weeks needs to learn to linger, slow down, and build these scenes up for a greater payoff. We're barely ever asked to consider something momentous before rushed along to the next bright, shiny plot-object.Very similar to Mistborn in its strengths and weaknesses, but much worse. The hype surrounding this debut obscures what a petty project it is, and while there are some great authors out there, I hope this sort of trilogy isn't indicative of the direction in which the fantasy genre is moving.Read only if you want a *very* light, fun fantasy that clunks along at times but keeps you turning pages and rolling your eyes.
