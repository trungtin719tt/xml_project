Some of my friends were raving about Coelho's "The Alchemist"; however, my first encounter with his writing is this book. I'm a little bit disappointed, though, because I expected more.My friends said that Coelho writes simple topics but with philosophies that could give new meanings on the subject--and some enhancement to the readers. I do agree on the philosophical thingy, but for my point of view, it doesn't quite fit in this book.Maria, the prostitute who became the main character in this book, is too sophisticated--way too sophisticated and too philosophical to the point of sounding false. Although the first part was engaging enough when Coelho describing Maria's desperate life in the small village in Brazil, he became too preachy when he started to explain the reasons of why Maria finally ended up being a prostitute, with the many false justifications on the many things she decided or thought of, including on the spiritual side.I could just say that Coelho did a fine research, though, on the sexual subject.
