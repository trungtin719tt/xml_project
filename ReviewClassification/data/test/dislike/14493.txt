Okay, so this book followed my reading of The Story ofEdgar Sawtelle. After that great work of literature, anything would pale, probably. Maybe I'm not being fair, but I really just didn't care for Sparks' latest. I've only read a few of his books, but already I'm seeing a pattern and I found myself getting bored and saying, "Awe, come on," throughout. The plot was too predictable, the characters were too generic, and I guess I just wasn't in to the whole storyline. The creepy cop ex-husband didn't help my desire to continue reading, either. Trite. That's how I'd describe it. Trite and that it left me feeling let-down.That being said, I read the book in a day....I kept wanting to be done with it and get it over with. While it was a rather harmless, quick-read romance, (which I like at times), I don't think I'll read another of Sparks' books. Too bad. I had liked previous books by him. He's gotta do better than this, though.Oh, and it kind of bugs me that he puts a full-blown photo of himself on the back cover of the book. What's that all about? I felt like I had to turn the book over so I didn't see him staring up at me whenever I set it down. Annoying. My husband is better-looking by far. I should have taped a picture of him on the book :).Maybe I'm too harsh, but that's my sum-up of this one.
