I had never planned on reading another Nicholas Sparks book, but my mother-in-law gave me a copy of this book thinking I would like it. And actually, I did start out enjoying it better than I thought I would, perhaps because one of the main characters is a young boy with a disability (and I have one of those myself), but the more I read on, the less I enjoyed it. The writing was so pedestrian that it barely sparked my interest, and the repeated references to Taylor's father's death without explanation became annoying. Of course I realized that it was an important mystery that somehow related to Taylor's inability to stay in a relationship, but, when, at the very end of the book, the death story is finally revealed, it is so horrifyingly pull-at-the-heartstrings, do-I-really-want-that-image-in-my-brain tragic, that I felt all the more manipulated. As popular a story-teller as he is, Nicholas Sparks just doesn't do it for me.
