The book starts off with Zoey and her many many men. Come on! All these men are starting to get annoying. Everyone is in love with this 17 year old and bowing to the "high-Priestess". It's well above and beyond ridiculous. What happened to Zoey? I used to like her. She isn't growing as a character, in fact, I think she is going the opposite direction.Poor Erik. He is struggling to deal with all the men that Zoey is freaking in love with and he is made out to be the @sshat?! Zoey is constantly cheating on him and yet his jealousy is in the wrong. What kind of weird message is being sent here?The major problem I've had with the series is the lame writing. I was hoping it gets better but it only gets worse. Cast tries to hard to sound young and in turn sounds ridiculous. No one talks like that. She used to be an English teacher and says she gets her lingo from listening to the students. Ha! She didn't pay much attention to them.The ending ... Spoiler Alert ...Cast killed off the only character I really liked!I would have given this only 1 star rating, but I did push myself to finish it.Plus side : Finally finally finally there is no long winded recap of the previous books!Stars Breakdown:Plot 2Cover 3Writing 1Originality 4Characters 2Romance/Chemistry 3Good enough to pick up again 1
