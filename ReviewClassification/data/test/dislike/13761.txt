This was another book that I found at a library sale that I never knew was a book. I have watched the movie several times and really liked it so once again I went into this book expecting it to be very similar to the movie.While the book and movie had many similarities with some slight differences there was some things that started happening about halfway through the book that were just weird and made no sense whatsoever to me.The way Forrest is portrayed in the book could come off as very offensive to people who suffer from the same mental health issues.I really just don't know what to say about this book. I went into it with high expectations because I loved the movie so much but unfortunately this was just a big disappointment.
