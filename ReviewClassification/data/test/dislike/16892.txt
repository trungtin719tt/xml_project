2.5 starsI'm 99% sure no other Sarah Dessen book can top Someone Like You as my least favourite book, so even though Lock and Key also got 2.5 stars from me, I liked it way, way better. I've always loved Sarah Dessen's books and the fact that family always plays a huge part of them. Unfortunately, the family dynamics was the only thing I liked about Lock and Key. Ruby's sister and brother-in-law are really portrayed fantastically and I loved seeing the relationship between Ruby and them develop throughout the book. Jamie is probably the best character, though.Ruby and Nate are a different story. Both are too stubborn for their own good and it took me theENTIREbook to warm up, at least a tiny bit, to them. It's not that they are bad characters, I just couldn't connect even the slightest to them and well, the result of that is obviously the rating of this book. The writing style, however, was as fantastic as always. I really am sad that I didn't like Lock and Key as much as I thought I would, but, on the other hand, I've read Along for the Ride the same week I've read this one and I really loved it. Sarah is apparently a complete miss or a complete hit for me.
