Burned is the long-awaited seventh book in P.C. and Kristin Cast's House of Night series. Now, I've been waiting for this book to come out ever since I finished Tempted. So, I'm sure you can understand how excited I was when I finally got the book. However, that excitement did not stick with me throughout the novel. Admittedly, there were some funny/good parts, but there were so many other things that bothered me. Those bothersome elements are what earned this book such a low rating.One of the first things I didn't like about this novel was the way it started out. It started from Kalona's point of view. Now, he is supposed to be the big baddie of the book, alongside Neferet. So, I did not really like seeing a "softer" side to Kalona. I do not want to like him and the first chapters had me feeling a little bad for him; I didn't like that. But, going along in that vein, I thought it was weird that Kalona was so conspicuously absent in the novel. He only really shows up a couple of times. The same goes for Neferet. She's part of the book for about two or three chapters and then she's not there anymore.The next issue I had with the book was Stevie Rae. I used to actually like her but now I can't stand her. I, personally, think she's been acting like a lying bitch and she deserved all the bad things she got. I was glad that someone finally found out that she'd been lying the whole time, even if I didn't really appreciate Dallas' freak-out.As much as I hate to say it, I am actually starting to like Rephaim. He is starting to be a little bit more...human. I mean, he's still in the "evil" category but there were definitely times in the book when he chose "good." Of course, I won't have a fully formed opinion about him until he finally makes a decision: His father/Darkness or Stevie Rae/Light?I thought it was, also, weird that Erin, Shaunee, Damien, and Jack were not in a lot of the book. I mean, all they really did was cry and then research. Sure, they helped figure out a way to get Stark onto the Isle of Women but they really didn't do much else.The two worst things, though, had to be Zoey and Heath. She was even more obnoxious in this book than in the others and she was certainly less intelligent. Now, I understand that she was "losing herself" and all that butcome on!It was ridiculous! I was glad, though, when she finally put her soul back together. I just hate that Stark had to be beaten and bloody for her to do it. And Heath? Holy hell, how did I ever like him?! He was so freaking annoying. And selfish. He was really willing to keep Zoey in the Otherworld with him instead of trying to send her back before Stark came and convinced him otherwise! And, if I had to read "Babe" or "Zo, babe" one more time, I think I was going to kill myself.Also, I hate their fake swear words. If you are going to try and be "badass" and swear, then use the real works! If I had to read "bullpoopie" or "bullcrap" one more time, I was really going to throw the book at the wall.There were two things, though, that I did like: Stark and Aphrodite. They have both always been favorites of mine. I love Aphrodite because she's sarcastic, funny, says whatever the hell she wants to, andshe's real. She is one of the few people in this series that I actually feel like I could meet in real life. Also, she is always there to help Zoey even if she hates to admit that she actually cares about anyone other than herself and Darius, who I also thought was conspicuously lacking in character development throughout this book. Stark, too, has always felt real to me. He, like Aphrodite, is sarcastic, funny, works as hard as he needs to in order to get what he wants, and like her, he is real. His stubborn attitude is part of what makes him real for me. What teenage guy isn't stubborn when it comes to getting what he wants? Also, his maturity from boy to man at the end is important in how I feel about him. He was able to take on responsibility and not be all whiney and complaining about it. And, as obnoxious as Zoey may be, a large part of me holds out hope that she will finally embrace Stark's love for her and be able to love him back.
