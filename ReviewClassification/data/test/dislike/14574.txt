A very very VERY begrudging two stars. I'd give it a one, but I reserve those for books I truly loathe and I just dislike this one.So.I have grown tired of poorly created dystopian worlds that exist not to make us think, but only as a prop for.... what do you think it will be?Guess.Guess.I dare you.Yeah, we are there yet again. In the ubiquitous love triangle. So manufactured and so terribly unneccessary and really, can these authors think of nothing else to add tension to a story or, I should say, tolengthena story?Again, too much of this book is wandering in the Wilds, in the cold, in the snow, and some of the things make no sense. They have no eating utensils. None. So they eat with their hands. They have plates, cooking pots, they even have metal traps for hunting but not a single spoon or fork. And so I am stuck on that. Why? I think they could find some small tree branch, whittle a bowl shape at one end and you've got a spoon. Surely while they are sitting around in the evenings, someone could be creating some spoons. It just seemed stupid.And again, if you are creating this world, kindly explain it. WHY did the government decide love was a disease?How did this happen?To say, here is this world, but never explain anything about it, well, that feels like lazy writing. It feels like a child stamping their feet and declaring "because I said so" rather than crafting an intelligently thought-out society. Yes, outlawing love in general makes absolutley no sense and because of that, the author needs to sell it to me with everything she has that it does in some way make sense to the leaders of this world.There are small things that I feel were put there to make you think there is some weird sexual obsession by the government, but that goes nowhere. Example page 50: "I hurry to the metal detector and unload my bag, then stand with arms and legs splayed while a man sweeps impassively with the wand over my breasts and between my legs." As I read this, I was thinking this is so ridiculous. She could have a weapon in her boot or up her sleeve or tucked in the back waistband of her pants, but as long as she doesn't shove it in her crotch or between her breasts, they'll never find it. What is so scary that they have to scan breasts and between the legs? How about simply saying "... while a man sweeps impassively with the wand over every inch of my body." That would at the very least make sense and not put the message that somehow women's private areas have become the things about which safety experts are the most concerned. What is the point of saying it that way?There is also this which bugged me enough that I went back to reference it.Description of Julian: "There is a long thin gash that runs from his eyebrow to his jaw..."Description of Alex: "... a scar runs from his eyebrow all the way down to his jaw."Hmmm. Just bothered me. Oh, well.What I liked best about the first book is completely gone from this one. First, I really thought the chapter headings being reading fromThe Book of SHHHand others added a lot of understanding and entertainment to the first book. None of that is in this one.Second, I applauded the fact that we didn't have a love triangle. Well, folks, I spoke too soon. As I've said, this entire book is nothing more than a set-up for the third book which is going to be all about the triangle.I also didn't care for the way the story is told in this one, with chapters titled Now and Then as the story goes back and forth between Lena's arrival in the Wilds and her life later in Brooklyn. There wasn't any reason for this, particularly as the Then portion just ends without actually linking up with the Now. And most of the Then is just about how she learns to live in the Wilds and could have really been perhaps one chapter. Again, though, if you're going to write a trilogy instead of one decent book, you've got to fill those pages somehow.The new love feels nothing so much as contrived. Yes I know there will be other readers who will say how much they love Julian and isn't he wonderful. But, in my opinion, the whole relationship feels forced. It's as if the author most of all wanted a new relationship (can't have a triangle without a new guy, after all) so she found a way to force Lena to spend time alone with a cute boy and let the longing glances begin. Really? It feels false. Or perhaps her feelings for either of these guys are nothing special as this is the first straight boy she's been alone with since Alex.And speaking of Alex, Lena just moves on. Oh, yes, she is heartbroken and woebegone, but let's face it, she forgets him in a short minute. Sheknowsthat what she's been told, that those who violate the law, aren't always immediately executed. Sheknowsthis is untrue by seeing it with her own eyes, not a rumor, not a maybe. Sheknowsbecause her own mother was assumed dead, but was in fact locked up for ten years.But Lena just trips along in the forest with the notion that Alex, whom she loved and adored and who risked his life for her, is surely dead. How? She makes not even one single attempt to find out if he has somehow survived. She. Moves. On.How are you going to sell me on how much she loves him if she can't even be bothered to check and see if he's gone?And guess what?So, buckle your seat belts for love triangle #4,856,823.Seriously disappointed.
