About the start of August both Untamed and Hunted were (FINALLY) released in Australia... so I'm really hoping that means we'll get Tempted the same time its released in America! (but my mum isn't... apparently I should be studying instead of reading...)Logically Zoey will get with Stark, because he's the only one who hasnt gotten or caused a broken heart yet. Also, because he's gorgeous, whereas Heath is obsessive and Erik is possessive. It's the best way.
