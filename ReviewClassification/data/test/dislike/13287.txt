Yup. I'm still not a John Green fan.One thing I have noticed about the characters John Green creates in his novels: they're too quirky, they're smart (this one in particular has an overly smart character) and they talk in quips. NOBODY TALKS LIKE THAT IN REAL LIFE. At least not all the time. I think this is John's way of incorporating himself into his books.Most YA readers see John Green as the best author ever, but his books are not that unique and his characters are the same with a few minor tweaks. I just don't get the hype.However, there were some memorable parts of this book that makes it unique: Tangents and footnotes. I thought that was a very clever addition that screamed Colin. I did NOT like the repetitiveness of the word fug and the name Katherine. I now hate that name thanks to this book. Overall, this book was just sooo hard to get into... I had to force myself to keep reading hoping it will get better. Instead, this just wasted my time. I could have been reading a book more enjoyable than this one during my break. Sighhhh.I guess I expected so much but got a mediocre, predictable read from an author who is labelled as one of the best in YA.
