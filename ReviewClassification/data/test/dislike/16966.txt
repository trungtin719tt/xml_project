Grisham has a way of writing a real page-turner. This was one of those books that I just couldn't put down. The suspense was intense, and the story was good.When I finished the last page, and I finally did put it down, I couldn't help thinking I had just wasted my time. I mean, I was thoroughly entertained for every minute of the book, but when I was done, I was left with nothing but the memories of my entertainment.Good book, excellent author, but lacking in anything real. I've read 4 Grisham novels... sometimes I just want to be entertained, I guess. If that's what you're looking for, then Grisham is your man. Pick any of his books. They're all the same.The movie was okay. This is probably one of Grisham's weaker books, but I'm not that good of a judge. If you want 2 hours of great entertainment, watch the movie. If you want more than that, read the book.Just like Grisham's novels, each of my reviews of his novels is almost identical to the last with only certain details changed to give it a new flavor.Go ahead Grisham, sue me. Then, you can write a story about it.
