I read this in high school... goodness knows why. I didn't particularly enjoy it, though it does keep moving along and kind of holds you in town hoping that eventually things will go right for the characters or that they will have some insight into their lives and take a little responsibility or face up and change eventually... but it never happens. This has got to be one of the most depressing books I've ever read. Unfortunately I can't even really say it presents women in a bad light or unfairly, because I still know women like this. I think this novel is a kind of anti-feminist classic; a kind of cautionary tale that maybe all teen girls should read so they don't ever grow up to be mindless bimbos who - despite their brains and talent and success and friendships with other women - STILL define themselves and their happiness entirely through the eyes and desires of men.
