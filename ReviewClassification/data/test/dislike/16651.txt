I have to warm you that I am going to give a spoiler here, the spoiler I happened upon as I had just begun reading this book and was just hooked enough by the descriptive style of writing and interesting content that I wanted to continue regardless. However, the spoiler ultimately affected my experience of the book and may affect yours as well. So don't read this, unless you've already read the book.The family that "Augusten Burroughs" focuses most of his memoir around are suing him. They say that some of the info is downright false (living outside for the summer of the yard sale) and some is vastly exaggerated and mean. They say that they still care for him, and suspect he is currently happy because he was fame-obsessed. They also say his name is Chris Robison.I found myself reading the name "Chris" in my mind over the place of the haughty "Augusten" that he has dubbed himself, just to gain perspective.This is like another adventure in James Frey land. How real is real enough?That being said, it's a fun and enjoyable book, though how it was funny is a little beyond me. He doesn't remind me of David Sedaris at all (as the book jacket suggests) and I laughed out loud rarely and despite myself. I don't dislike it, I just don't love it. I will watch the movie, just to see. So I suppose it has hooked me in a way.
