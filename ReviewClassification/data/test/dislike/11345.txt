My wife and I were heading to Philadelphia for a long weekend, and decided to get an audiobook for the road trip. After a short conversation about how that "female bounty hunter movie" was based on a best selling book, I downloaded this. I was slightly curious, as I have seen the author's name on bookshelves for years now, and didn't know anything other than that she was very fond of numbers in her titles.Eight minutes into our road trip my wife asked me to shut the book off, as she had a headache. All we heard was a childhood flashback about the main character getting tricked by a neighborhood kid into playing "train tunnel" in her pants. I was happy to acquiesce, as I thought both the book and the narrator were dreadful.But now I feel compelled to finish what I started, since I paid for it, and I have to listen to something while commuting in rush hour traffic. So either the book is going to improve significantly, or I am going to have fun writing a scathing review when it's finally over.UPDATE:I finished listening to this yesterday. It was beyond awful.The main character, Stephanie Plum, makes stupid decision after stupid decision. In fact, I cannot think of a single rational, logical decision she made at any point in the novel. And all the while, the reader is subjected to constant descriptions of her clothing, jewelry and make-up.Supporting characters around her appear and disappear, serving only as thinly veiled plot devices. Her family, her boss and Ranger are never mentioned after the half-way point of the novel. I lost count of how many times Plum catches up to Morelli only to not even try to apprehend him.Deus ex machina moments occur regularly. More than one character seems clinically schizophrenic. The "mystery" would have never been solved, if not for alengthy expository speechby the villain right before he plans to kill the protagonist.No way would I ever pick up another one of these books. Oh, and why am I not surprised to learn that Janet Evanovich is one of Stephenie Meyer's favorite authors?
