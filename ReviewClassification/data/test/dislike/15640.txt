Daniel &amp; Luce. A love that spreads across eons of time and one that ends in Luce dying in a ball of fire each and every time. Except this time, something is different and Luce's on a journey through their past lives to find out why. Through ancient China, old fashioned England and Egyptian tombs Luce winds her way towards the answer she is searching for....And then here is where my problems lie..WHAT ON EARTH IS SHE SEARCHING FOR?I know I know, it's all pre-determined and she had to do it to change the past/therefore change the future, but really the whole time I was just thinking, "and the point of that was?". It just frustrated me and the more I think about it, the more problems I have with it.The whole book pretty much didn't need to happen, I admit at the start I was thinking 'this is kinda cool going back in time' but I honestly thought it would only be for half the book, not the entire novel. It also meant I missed the other characters, it was pretty much the Luce and Daniel show (and if youlovetheir soppy and sometimes over the top, death defying and completely unrelatable love then you will adore this book) with Shelby and Miles popping into a past life for what seemed like no reason what-so-ever and a small performance by Annabelle who just popped out of no-where. I missed the snarky, witty banter from Cam and the delightful relationship between Roland and Arriane.And if anyone can tell me the answer to two simple questions, well i'd love you forever...Why do all the other fallen angels (i.e Arriane, Cam, Roland, Gabbe etc. always hang around Daniel and ultimatly Luce in each life?Maybe i've missed something, but come on, they are always hanging around and i'm not quite sure why, perhaps they are just awesome friends who like to watch Luce die over and over again, or perhaps i'm just being cynical and they're just besties.AndHow does Daniel keep changing his appearance in almost each past life?Suddenly he's Egyptian, and the next minute he has his whole torso tattooed, and then he's oreintal? I'm not sure I get this either.Phoar, glad I got that all off my chest.All in all, it was an easy read and had it's great moments, but I had too many questions left to ask rather than any of them being solved.Also secretly I want Cam to end up with Luce.
