This really is not a good book. It's a combination between an F. Scott Fitzgerald novel where everyone just sits around having double brandies all day (but with no sex) and the Plague(but with no gory details.) The premise, an atomic holocaust has obliterated the northern hemisphere and all of Australia awaits a radioactive cloud that is coming to kill everyone on earth in 6 month of time. The whole book is just a count down in which you get to know some of the most boring and two dimensional characters around. The entire thing could have been a ten page short story, and it still would have been a depressingly weak effort. It's too bad too because A Town Like Alice (written by the same author) is actually one of my favorite books.Question: how did this novel get on the list of 100 best novels of all time (published by the modern library association)?
