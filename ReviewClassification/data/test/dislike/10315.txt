I know Rick Riordan can do better than this since he already has with the Percy Jackson series. I won't compare the two, but I will say that excellent children's books do exist, and this is not even close. Ancient Greek mythology and ancient Egyptian culture are probably the two most popular subjects that exist. Most people find them fascinating. I was very excited when I heard about this book and have been waiting to read it for some time. When I found out more about it I was even more excited. A coming of age story with magical powers thrown in on top of the ancient Egyptian theme-awesome. So what went wrong?First, no character development. There are two narrators, a brother and sister, and they don't really have their own personalities. They go through the motions, complete tasks, and have conversations, but there isn't much there personality wise. Sure, one of them dresses in combat boots, and the other one is a bit bookish, but that's all we get. In other books the characters have clear personalities. Examples: Fablehaven, Harry Potter, or even the Percy Jackson series. Each character is distinguishable and unique. That is not the case here, and the book suffers from it. I really think authors need to know that a long drawn out action sequence is just not good enough.Which brings me to the second problem with this book, the plot. There is a bad guy that wants to destroy the world and the main characters have to stop him. Not too deep, but not much different from the general plot in the other books I mentioned. What makes it a problem in this book? The way plot is developed. The characters go where they are told to start the novel. Then, they run into someone that tells them to go see someone else. They go see that person, who then leads them to another person. Get the idea? In the middle of this there will be some danger in the form of a monster or a dangerous location. A book that consists almost entirely of go here do this, go there do that, fight something, go retrieve something, then go talk to this person, is just not good enough. I've played those video games before, they are boring.My third issue is the bad guys. Why is it that children's books never have deep, intelligent, powerful, bad guys? They are always cardboard muahaha style baddies, and The Red Pyramid is no exception. When the bad guy decides to have a long drawn out conversation in the middle of a fight I cringe. The bad guys are just too cheesy in this book, and it's sad. I guess if the main characters have no depth, then their enemies can't be expected to have any either. The super powerful Egyptian entities are no better. They are all eccentric, and some come off as stupid. I don't appreciate powerful beings acting like five year olds. I don't understand why the author chose to portray them that way, it is certainly not funny to me. I guess having Bast constantly reference Friskies is supposed to be funny, but I personally didn't like it.The last issue that I will mention is progression. I like my characters to mature and progress, but again, if they have no personalities, there isn't much to improve upon. The plot was agonizingly slow as well. I was getting tired of the book by the third of fourth person the characters met, and there was at least twenty more to go at that point. If the interactions with these new characters had any effect on the outcome of the book I may have been more interested. Instead, they simply pointed the characters in the direction of the next task.I can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about this book except maybe the beginning before the danger came into play. I really am sick of books where the characters go through the motions and complete task after task. I've read other books where the entire thing feels like one big chase scene, and this is no different. I won't be continuing with this series, and it's a shame because the author could have done so well with the ancient Egpytian theme. Instead, he chose to trivialize everything in a weak attempt at humor that just didn't work for me.
