First I would like to say I've never given a book 1 star, because I think that just the dedication of an author earns him at list 2 stars. The second thing is that I think that's the longest review I've ever wrote. It says something.This book doesn't deserve rating at all. Because it was a perfect copy of Vampire Academy series. And not in a good way.I'm utterly disappointed and upset with Jennifer L. Armentrout. How can she do that? How did the publishers let her publish a book that is a copy of another?First of all, the main idea. Daimons? Half-bloods? Pures? It equals Strigoi, Damphirs and Moroi.Once a Pure drinks the Aether (blood) from another, it becomes a monster, a Daimon. It's just like vampires.The plot begins with Alex who is returning to the Covenant (The Academy) after a long time. She needs to catch up with her training, to be a Guardian - Oops, a Sentinel one day and kill Strigoi - ah, Daimons. And of course no one agrees to give her private training, except for the hot Sentinel (Guardian) Aiden.Just like with Dimitri in VA.From then the plot focuses on the relationship of Alex and Aiden and her training.Some of the scenes with Alex and Aiden were just like with Rose and Dimitri that I really became furious. Aiden treating Alex with her injury just like Dimitri did Rose, Aiden preaching Alex about her behavior like Dimitri did.And the characters!Alex=Rose.Aiden=Dimitri.Lea=Mia.Caleb=Mason.Deacon=Adrian.And I'm sure there's more.And the ending?? Alex being kidnapped just like in book 2 in VA series.I tried to give this book a chance when I started reading it and noticed all the similarities because I thought- NO WAY IS SHE COPYING EVERY WORD AND EVERY SCENE!But she did. And it's just a shame.
