You're kidding me - right?That isnothow you write a sequel!I ambeyonddisappointed by this novel. It was simply a chore to read. And there is purely 1 reason for my general dislike of the novel:MeganA.k.a. The Bella Swan of the Iron Fey series. I couldn't stand to read about her. She was just so irritating. I get it - you're in love with Ash - but I mean, c'mon. Have some self-respect, girl.Look. I love romance. I'm the romance kinda gal. If there isn't romance in a book, I'llmakeromance. But I could not take any of the Ash/Megan romance seriously. Her only thoughts about anything were "Boy, he's hot. Dangerous. I shouldn't love him. Ash, I love you!"And when he tries to make it clear that he doesn't return her affections, instead of hiking up her skirt and walk out, she sobs. And sobs.Andsobs.Although I am Team Puck, I wouldn't have minded Ash if it had been developed. Instead, I felt the author rushed their romance to the point where it was disbelieving and felt forced. Megan's only known Ash for how long, 6 months? A year, tops? And yet, she's "in love" with him?Worse, she becomes whiny and insecure and just weak. I hate weak female characters, they just ugh!More than half of this book is just her whining about how Ash doesn't love her. That she's second best. Blah. Blah.BLAHBut when she wasn't whining, Ash was. His jealous little mood swings were seriously unnecessary and I just don't see any chemistry between him and Megan. She looks like your ex. That doesn't mean you love her.Which brings me to my second largest complaint: The love triangle.Excuse me while I barf.Did the author seriously have to jump aboard the bandwagon and include a love triangle in her series? Of course she did, why not divide the fans eh?Clearly, I'm not a fan of the icy stone-heartedbad-boy-cliche-stock-character-Edward-Cullenprince Ash. I'm a fan of Puck. Why? Easy. He knew Megan longer. He knows how to make her smile. He doesn't toy with her emotions or treat her like crap.But does Megan care about any of that? Nope. One look of hottie bad boy and it's bye bye Puck.Which totally sucks. Because Puck's my favorite character. And reading about him hurting makes me hurt. I mean - seriously - why can't the best friend get the girlfor once?Puck, unlike Ash, is a unique character. He would, at least in my opinion, make a much better boyfriend than Ash could ever be.But screw Megan. I don't even want her to be with Puck anymore. He deserves better than her whiny little self.The ending though. That stupid ending. I just - I can't.I am so regretful that I paid money for this book, because right now it's shoved in the back of my closet. I don't even know if I want to read the next book after that. My poor baby.(view spoiler)[ I can't freaking believe that after all that, Megan still joins Ash. She left Puck. He freaking begged her to stay with him and what does she do? Leaves.And then the author decides to end the book all happy with Ash and Megan being all couple-y andcompletelyignoring the fact that poor Puck is heartbroken and alone and adfjkdjfkdjsfkjda(hide spoiler)]The only reasons I gave this book 2 stars rather than 1 was because of:a) Iron horseb) PuckIron horse was one of my favorites in the book. As soon as you get past the CAPSLOCK THAT MAKE IT SEEM LIKE IT'S SCREAMING IN YOUR HEAD he's actually a very likable character.When Puck (finally) made his appearance, I couldn't stop the grin that appeared on my face. And that kiss ... I enjoyed reading about that kiss. It was very, hot.I also enjoyed the continued Iron Fey plot line and concept. The idea is genius, no doubt. Now, if the idea can be the focus and the romance the subplot, then this book would be a winner.Overall, I was extremely disappointed with this novel. After enjoying the first book so much, I expected so much of the sequel and was unfortunately let down. I probably will read the next book but I'm not expecting much at all.
