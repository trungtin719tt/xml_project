I fell in love with Delirium as hard as Lena fell for Alex, and when the ending hit, my heart tore into two directions. One, I wanted to jump inside the book and throw Alex over the fence; second, I practically cried and pushed Lena into the woods. It was tragic like Romeo and Juliet, and I can't wait for Pandemonium.But watch this happen...Lena is living on her own in the Wilds, having a good time and feeling free. And she meets some guy and he becomes her first real friend while she's there and he helps her learn the ropes (What ALEX would've done if he were there)and she'd start falling in love with him and getting over Alex, who she still cares about.Meanwhile, without Lena or anyone knowing, Alex is being held in the Crypts or something. Waiting there...thinking of Lena everyday...praying she's alright...while she's off with someone else. And somehow Alex breaks free (Maybe -just maybe- Lena's mom comes back to save him. VERY FAR FETCHED POSSIBILITY HERE!!!) And him (and her mom?) make some huge grand entrance into the Wilds, to find Lena in a very...awkward position with the other guy. Alex is outraged and he storms off and Lena's shocked that he's alive and she is torn between the two guys and, ta da, the classical love triangle.If that happens, I won't be surprised, but I personally love Alex, and if it were me, I wouldn't stop thinking about him at all. He sacrificed freedom for Lena (Possibly his life, depending on whether he's really dead or not)and I don't think I could ever forget him.EDIT:Plus...Did the new Lena get contacts?
