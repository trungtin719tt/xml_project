I can't describe how much I HATE doing it, but I had to quit this book a third of the way through. I'd expected, naively I suppose, for a bitter sweet, heartfelt novel along the lines of 'To Kill a Mockingbird' (the blurb on the front cover hinted that fans of Lee's book were in for a treat); instead, I was soon driven mad by a contrived plot, full of nauseating sentiment and cheesy melodrama. The plot is so contrived, in fact, that the narrator is constantly unable to explain how events he describes came to pass, and chooses instead simply to ask the reader to believe that it happened.The dreadful story was bad enough, but the portion of the book I read seemed to read like an anti-TKAM - the one-dimensional characters seemed perfectly comfortable with their Deep Southern prejudices (the fact that all of the town's other white folk shared the same opinions was apparently reason enough for their snobbish, racist views), and the author's treatment of her novel's black characters was, at best, patronising. Unlike Scout and Atticus, none of the characters had any redeeming qualities, and in fact were all pretty detestible in their own way.I've rarely been left so disappointed by a novel, and the fact that this is only the fourth that I've ever failed to finish is testament to this. This is definitely one to avoid, unless you fancy some cheap chick-lit to tide you over on your holiday to Europe. I guarantee that you'll draw little comfort from the time you spend with the novel, though it may leave you feeling cold...
