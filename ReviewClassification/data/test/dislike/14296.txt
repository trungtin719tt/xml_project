If only humans were robots...If you were a paraplegic who had just fallen from an 11-story-building, and the by-standers shot you with automatic rifes and blew you with 100 grenades, leaving you behind as an amorphous mixture of blood and flesh. You would not have to worry. You are not your cirumstances.The author, Stephen R. Covey, passed away in July this year. Rest in peace. He left a positive mark and this needs to be appreciated.Now to the book...I bought it about 2 years ago, but never bothered reading it. It had a self-help look and feel about it which prevented me. In retrospect, I could have walked out of the bookstore without it, but fate had its way. And so it did last week, when a teacher of mine talked about this book and praised it. Oh yes he did. His opinion was that it was literally life altering. I thought, I already had the book, why not give it a read? You know, maybe it'll make me smarter, and a better person.The thesis is clear from the get-go. The author realized that most of the self-help books focused on secondary problems so his intention was to focus on the effective practices which were fundamental in human nature. The real thesis? A self-help book that will vilify all the existing self-help books and then triumphantly walk as the 'true', read:self-help, book.Make no mistake, every grain of this book is reaking of the generic self-help ideas. From the start the author berates self-help books as having 'platitudes', and by the 3rd habit chapter, I had enough of THIS book's platitudes.It breeds in you your superirity, your ego. Your wife doesn't want to have sex with you, you choose to accept have sex with her. Your boss doesn't call you in the evening, you choose to go for the betterment of the business you work at. It wants you to become that ultimate prick.I have read sentences in this book that made me vomit! The all-encompassing, all-positive, all-self-help-vocabulary-I-can-use-in-one-sentence kind of sentences.Coming back to the opening of this review. The book doesn't make a room for humanness. On one hand, it wants you to live a life of your priorities, but then it tells you that don't get carried away with feelings, emotions or circumstances. The book kept quoting Viktor Frankl, which was very frustrating because life is not Frankl's concentration camp.I am not perfect, I am probably not a leader. But at least I enjoy life at its fullest, I love all moments, I enjoy rain, I take walks just for the hell of it, I read stupid books just to feel superior. I regurgitate bullshit for conversations... I am a human and this book was definitely not for me.
