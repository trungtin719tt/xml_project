I saw the movie first and kind of liked it. So, of course I thought "Well the book is always better than the movie" so I decided to read it, even though its written for teens and I wasn't too sure I could relate. I guess I couldn't because this is one time I liked the movie a lot better than the book. I mean really, how many 15/16 year old girls do you know who's parents let them go trapezing all over the world (in Lena's case literally) and don't think twice about it. Come to think of it how many 15/16 year old girls have the money to it even if they're parents really are that totally oblivious. Not to mention Bailey, who is roaming around with Tibby all summer despite a major medical condition that would most certainly keep her slowed down, if not out completely.The main characters in this book are flat and, frankly, boring and the situations they are in are really not very believable. The adults are almost completely absent, and when they are present they are made out to be selfish, stupid, unaware, or all of the above.This is a perfect teen angst novel that I'm sure will appeal to teenagers everywhere who will find this a wonderful book about girls their own age who get to do what they want when they want and have really no real consequences. Not to mention the whole "My friends are my life" theme which will also appeal to a younger angrier audience. For those of us who have battled through those misunderstood years and know that life doesn't work quite that way, well...this novel will leave most ADULTS cold.
