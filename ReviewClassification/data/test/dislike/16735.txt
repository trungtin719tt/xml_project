I'm going to be honest, I'm not really sure what I think of this book.There was like this weird interconnected plotline between all the characters, but I don't think it was even really relevant to anything. Japan and Germany won World War II. America has these little hold out places and The Man in the High Castle wrote an alternative history book where America and Great Britain won the war instead. Then you have this whole antique collection angle and people schemeing to reignite wars. I just have no idea.Part of the problem could be all the distractions while I was trying to read this one. Maybe I missed some bits and pieces that tied it all up nicely. Who knows?So maybe give this one a read sometime? I'll probably comeback to it sometime in the future in a better setting and have a go again. Which is maybe what the story was trying to say at the end. There is always hope for a better future.
