If I could give it negative stars, I would. So many things I didn't like about the book...here's a few in list format!1. No paragraphs...only phrases. It's hard to feel like youre reading a complete thought, when....you're not.2. I know using the word "Dude" is addictive, but oddly enough, it's even more annoying to read it over and over than to hear/say it.3. The way he always (and when I say always, I mean every time, every other page) referred to his penis as his 'dog' was nausiating. Really. Disgusting.4. I never gave a shit about one single person in this book. Not a single one!5. There's a chapter at the very end about having sex on planes. It's the most descriptive and comprehensive chapter in the book, and I can't figure out how it has anything at all to do w/ the plot. I wouldn't be surprised if he wrote this chapter 5 years before even thinking about the plot of this book, and didn't know what else to do with it, so he just stuck it in there. Or, on the other hand, maybe he revolved the entire book AROUND this chapter...like it was the egg and the book is the chicken.And the so-called 'clencher' your hear about in reviews...not so clenching.
