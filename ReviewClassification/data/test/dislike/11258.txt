I have never had such a horribly visceral reaction to a novel. The story unfolded tragically but the writing unraveled something worse. The author only succeeded in presenting two sides of a story equally - I didn't care about either one, or the little abode (widows walk or not).To torture myself further, I watched the movie. I am a fan of Ben Kingsley and couldn't possibly see how he would go blindly into such a disappointing set up. You know how the movie is never as good as the book - this is one time where I was truly wishing would break that mold. But it didn't. Come on, Jennifer Connelly as the alcoholic, down-trodden and desperate protagonist? I was picturing Mary Louis Parker (think The Client, 1994).It left me wanting my time back.
