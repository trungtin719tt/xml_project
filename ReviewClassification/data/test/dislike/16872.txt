I hatedAnthemso much that I vowed never to read another book by Ann Rand, but I still talk about how much I hate all of her other books, too. That's how much I dislikedAnthem. I also think I have the right to hateThe Fountainheadwithout having read it because:a) Ayn Rand is a horrible writer. Everything I've seen by her is badly written and I don't like badly written books.b) Ayn Rand thought she was a philosopher and injects her silly "objectionist" point of view into all her books. She wasn't a philosopher, however, no matter what her silly followers think. Cult leader, perhaps.c) Ayn Rand's "objectionism" is simply selfishness dolled up a bit, so I will hate the "lesson" in her books.d) I hate books with clear lessons. Ayn Rand has clear lessons.e) Ayn Rand has such a knee-jerk, reactionary dislike of anything striking of collectivism that she makes Orwell look like a communist. Knee-jerk reactionaries seldom write good books.
