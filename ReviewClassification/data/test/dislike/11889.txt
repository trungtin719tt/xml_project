There's math to these stars.Here goes:+1 for being written by Rachel Caine, right off the bat. I genuinely enjoyed Ill Wind; it was a creative, rip-roaring five-chapter venture into a new kind of urban fanatasy, and it was cool. I didn't even mind the hot tub scenes, and the ending was acceptable. I've also read one of Ms. Caine's short stories set in Morganville, in an anthology, and thought it was interesting and that I'd like to know more about the series.+1 for rendering fairly logical vampires. Can't go out in daylight, have to be invited into a house, etc; it rings true with most of the older vamp mythos I've encountered, and any deviations (AMELIE, I'm looking at you) were explained in ways that, while they do seem a little deus ex machina, I can deal with. (I should mention here that no, I'm not an expert on vampire mythology, but I have read Dracula.)+1 for the interesting housemates, though Michael was a little bit too perfect at times. Shane I saw coming a long way off, though that's probably thanks to that short story, but for a while I thought Caine was going to draw it out over a few books and just give him a protector complex in this one. Oh well. Eve was pretty cool- I think she was my favorite, just because she was abnormal but she was so muchmorenormal in terms of how she functioned in society than Shane or Michael. And she seems to have some pretty big insecurities and worries, making her a bit motherly/responsible towards the others.+1 for being easy to read. Okay, so I know it sounds dumb, but it's a small book and it took me about half a day, all told- actually considerably less, now that I think about it. And given the minuses, this is a very good thing.-1 for Claire in general, and the first two chapters in particular. We are told from the beginning that she is OMGubersmart. We are told that she finished highschool in two years (which, by the way, means a lot of summer classes if her school is anything like mine) and that Ivy League colleges were practically begging at her feet. Her parents- including her dad, who she later thinks of in a way that convinced me he's very focused on her academics- wouldn't let her go there because she was 'too young'. And this is where I interject: "NO SHIT SHE'S TOO YOUNG. SHE CAN STAY IN HIGHSCHOOL AND TAKE AP CLASSES AND GET COLLEGE CREDIT FOR TWO MORE YEARS AND THEN ENROLL AS A FRIGGIN' JUNIOR OR SOMETHING. And because she is OMGubersmart, she'll see this financially wise option/way to placate the 'rents, right? Umm... actually, not right. Not right at all. Instead, her parents ignore the fact that prestigious colleges will probably do whatever they ask to get their daughter there, up to and including any special supervision they might want to feel she's safe, and decide to enroll her in the idiotically named Texas Prarie University. There, instead of being, say, in some sort of small Honors-only housing complex, she's on the top floor in the worst rooms of the worst dorms.Um, yeah. Way to go, protective parents; you've put your daughter in StupidSchool and, moreover, the rattiest part of it. So, how'd that one work out?BADLY. Claire corrects one of the popular girls on the nature of WWII, who turns out to be one of those oddly common mean girls who haunt the pages of fiction, existing solely to make life a misery for the protagonist- not just to, say, ruin their social reputation or knock them down in the halls, but to ACTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY go after the harmless lowlife who has offended them so. In this case, this would be up to and including stealing Claire's laundry and pushing the girl down several flights of stairs. And absolutely no one will stand up to this mean girl- Monica- from the other students to the administration to the town police. Frankly, this is ridiculous. If people like this were as common as books about highschool and college make them seem, no one would make it out alive.I mentioned that the town police won't stand up to Monica. We know this because later they show up on her side- not because Claire calls them. Ms. OMGubersmart isn't nearly smart enough to call 911, it seems, or her parents. I mean, at the point that you're being pushed down a flight of stairs, it's time to suck it up and GO THE HELL HOME, no matter what. Worst they can do is make you wait a few years to go to one of the Ivies. Take online courses, get a job, or something.And by the way, if her parents were looking for a place where their little girl would be safe, why did they pick Morganville? Even from the descriptions Claire gives in passing, it sounds like a nasty place, certainly not somewhere an overprotective parent would want their sixteen year-old. I call BS. I call BS on Claire and I call it on Monica and I call it on both Danvers parents.(Also, Claire does not seem to be taking English courses. Odd, for someone who claims to be well-versed in the classics. And that's another thing- she's casually arrogant about being smart. 'Not everyone is up on the classics- except freaks like me.' 'I corrected Monica on the fact that WWII wasn't about China, but the people around her probably didn't know what it was anyway.' Ms. Caine, are we supposed to believe Claire is smart because she puts down all these other people? Are we supposed to accept that just because she thinks- thinks, and has no real reason to know- they don't know something, they actually don't? She's not even snooty, which I could live with- she's just utterly convinced of her own superiority, and it comes out in annoying little moments.)-1 for the ending. (Rant follows.) WHAT in the WORLD makes an author think they can get away with this? There was a nice denoument, and then another chapter. Thinking this would continue the nice denoument, I walked into this backhanded trap blindly. NEVER under any circumstances is there a reason to introduce a NEW PROBLEM AND/OR ENTIRE NEW PLOT AT THE END OF THE GODDAMN BOOK! This is worse than leaving the action at a critical point (Phillip Pullman and Bruce Coville are both guilty)- both are shameless ways to make sure you read the next book, but at least leaving the action doesn't feel grasping. This 'Big battle is over, all is well, OH SHIT NEW CRISIS' business hangs a sign around the author's neck. Know what it says? "I want money, and I don't think the book itself was good enough to get you to buy the next one- in fact, maybe I know it was crap- and so I tacked this on at the end and put a critical character's life in question so you'll buy the sequel and my publisher and I will make bank."AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRGH.Will I read the series? @&amp;$# NO. That ending pissed me off too much, and when the last impression I have of a book is anger, I have no reason to continue.
