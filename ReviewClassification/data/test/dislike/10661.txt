Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn had two huge strokes of luck withOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich.Firstly Khrushchev allowed its publication in the journalNovy Mir. This is something that should make readers cautious. It was the first story published in the Soviet Union set in the Gulag system, it wasn't a a searing indictment of the soviet system it was something that was considered fit for publication in the context of a society which was making tentative steps into de-Stalinisation.Secondly it was published during the Cold War and was seized upon as a searing indictment of the soviet system by the wider world. This provided Solzhenitsyn with an excited international readership and funding for translation which was only to dry up midway through his Red Wheel cycle because the Cold War was over at which point the mysterious agencies that were keen to have him translated into English during the Cold War unaccountably ran out of interest.In retrospect it strikes me that Ivan Denisovich's life in the Gulag is pretty good compared to what I have heard of life in British prisons. He gets to work on a building site, he's with people all day long, he isn't locked up in a single cell for maybe twenty hours a day with nothing meaningful to do. The regime is mild in comparison with Ginzberg'sInto the Whirlwind(view spoiler)[ but then I am a fan of Ginzberg's book, read it if you can and the sequel too, which is also full of bizarre things(hide spoiler)], probably a fair reflection of the differences between winding up in that system in the post war period rather than in the 1930s but above all this is a book that needs to stand along sideNotes from the House of the Deadas a stage in the self creation of a writer. Curiously both writers end up as nationalists(view spoiler)[ sending Solzhenitsyn to the USA was possibly a crueller blow to the man than sending him to Siberia seeing as his response was to live behind a stockade protected against his new neighbours(hide spoiler)], the question for every reader to find their own answer to is whether that is despite or because of their prison experiences?One of my old lecturers, a gloriously opinionated old woman who would occasionally wear horse brasses as though she was the embodiment of the rural response to the Beastie Boys, was of the opinion thatOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovichwas not only the best work of Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn from a literary point of view but also one that had been much improved in the process of being translated into English.
