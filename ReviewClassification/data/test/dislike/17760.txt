The author Nevil Shute left Britain and migrated to Australia because he believed that the advent of the Welfare State would cause people to go soft(view spoiler)[ because obviously life should be hard and characterised by arbitrary harshness towards one another, that's what toughens people up so they can steal chickens from the Japanese(hide spoiler)]. Australia in his imagination was a decently virile and macho kind of place, and perhaps it is. In the way that popular fiction often is, this is a heavily ideological novel. So the ideal reader of this book:believes that white skinned people are naturally superior to all others,and that segregation is a a sensible response to humans having different skin tones,and that if a white man marries a non-white woman (or meta-white) we should feel sympathy and sorrow for his desperate state,and that a white woman may marry a non-white man if she is catholic,and that there is a a self evident and natural division of labour between man the mechanic, and woman the home maker,and that women ought not to be trusted to manage money on account of their giddiness until they are deep into their 30s, unless married and with children, however even in such circumstances the supervision of a suitably serious man is still advisable,inevitably homosexuals can't operate heavy machinery (assuming any such persons exist outside of medical speculation - which is obviously highly unlikely especially in Australia),and that nature exists to provide us with fancy leather footwear or briefcases,and finally it is inevitable that organised labour causes decent people to throw their hands up in the air with despair and close down their businesses.Aside from this, unlike inAn Old Captivity, Shute does remember at the end of his yarn that he is using a framing story to convey the narrative to the reader. Culturally this is an interesting novel in being I guess an early example of the Australia fascination that led to TV programmes likeThe Flying Doctorsandthe young flying Doctors,the SulivansandSkippy the flying kangaroosludging up daytime TV schedules in the UK in the 70s and 80s to the detriment ofCrown CourtandMr Benn,there is a nice early positive reference to Australian wine as well, at the same time we see that Australia will look not to the UK but to the USA as its role model- again a prescient insight. Curiously the early part of the plot works counter to the racial assumptions of the latter part, in that it is through abandoning their assumption of superiority, bargaining with a Malay head- ( relying on citing the holy Qu'ran to make their point too)-man offering to help with the rice cultivation in exchange for hospitality that a party of English women &amp; children manage to survive WWII after the ignominious surrender in the face of inferior numbers of the British in Singapore to Japan- this according to the author's note was a truish story except it happened in Sumatra not Malaya and the women &amp; children were Dutch not English(view spoiler)[ which begins to sound like one of those jokes which are entirely true apart from every detail being different(hide spoiler)]- maybe a significant difference for the lead character it is entirely natural to express her gratitude by going back to pay for a well and wash area to be constructed in the village after the war which is why the disjoint is so striking when later Miss Paget - our hero, well main character really - has no common feeling with the Australian aboriginals, their role as an inferior servant caste is accepted by her without comment. Amusingly the leading lady gets to know her leading Australian man at during the war and he fancies her then on account of her native dress - sarong and blouse, later seeing her dressed all in English style he can't touch her at which point she adopts the strategy fromShe stoops to conquer(view spoiler)[ just to be completely explicitly about this(view spoiler)[ the love interest and Miss Paget meet in Malaysia during the war as prisoners - she then is dressed 'like a native' and they have a cosy and chatty relationship, after the war they meet again and she is dressed like a decent Englishwoman ought to be in the Australian outback (I imagine a tweed skirt suit with a hat and a white blouse), the love interest can hardly look at her, so on a mini break she dresses down to a sarong and top, rape is avoided, but from the authors words we seem to be in the territory of violent sexual assault - thus revealing a fine range of attitudes on race and sexuality(hide spoiler)](hide spoiler)]and having put on a sarong is soon left bruised by his uncontrollable ardour - mileage here for an essay on dress as status code and the overlap between attitudes towards race and sexual availability(view spoiler)[ reading between the lines we can imagine that relationships on the cattle stations were deeply integrated, ahem(hide spoiler)]. Really a book of its time - however in another reading it is an early pro-globalisation text (the alligator shoe business is set up in Australia to undercut the high costs of production in Britain) and pro internal (white) migration as a means of economic development, mildly amusing with its conception of pillar industries that underpin/hold up a superstructure of an economic ecosystem (largely through the promotion of decent all white sexual relations pursued within marriage(view spoiler)[ from which I propose a new field of study - sexual-economics(view spoiler)[ which is to be thought of as rather like home-economics, but a bit duller(hide spoiler)](hide spoiler)]). Enablinga town like AliceSprings to develop in the deepest outback. This is also of its time in being a technological novel - technology leaps all barriers and provides the solutions to the novels 'problems' in the forms of a/c units, DDT, aeroplanes, radios, &amp; bulldozers. There is no questioning of he appropriateness of the technology the wisdom of its application is accepted as self-evident - all of which common sense applications of technological solutions to non-existent problems have led us to our current environmental situation.This book I rescued and will now deposit in the paper recycling box for resurrection into some useful paper product.
