Michelle KwaitPicture Book(SPOILER ALERT)Summary:The Stinky Cheese Man is narrated by the infamous Jack, of Jack and the Bean Stalk. The book is made up of a collection of tales, that Jack leads us through. Jack prefaces with the fact that the stories are almost fairy tales, but not quite: they are in fact, fairly stupid tales (and may be dangerous to your health). Scieszka takes the reader through classic fairy tales, with a twist: the Little Red Hen gets a bit whiny, Chicken Licken sees not the sky, but the table of contents falling down, and The Really Ugly Duckling grows up to just be a really ugly duck.Critique:This book was hilarious, and somewhat whimsical-- the characters themselves were done in a post-modern style, with a gritty, dark edge to them. The author and illustrator collaborate to make a silly, playful presentation of the book.
