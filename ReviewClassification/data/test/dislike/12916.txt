so...reading this book, in places, made me long to go back to Atlantic Beach, made me go back and read my diaries of New York.I thought carefully about whether my strongly adverse feelings about this book were actually warranted or not. I have decided that there is a middle ground I must take here.Here's my unabashed assessment, untainted by the millions of people who seem to LOVE this book:if you've already lived the hard life, and come through it, worse for the wear but better in soul, don't bother with Gifts From the Sea. It will probably seem like common knowledge in the form of over-elaborate metaphor to you.However, if you are living the hard life right now, this book still might not be worth the read, because if you are truly in a rough spot, battling the demons of life, this may just make you bitter that some lady with a rich social life and ample resources is trying to tell you how to live yours. That said, it's always worth a shot to read and gain insight into something, so see how it strikes you.The people I actually recommend this to are those who are young traditionalists. I can see how a young mother might gain much wisdom from this. Or a person just starting out in life, maybe in a dorm somewhere, or maybe someone young who has just graduated college.This is a book meant for people who started right, followed the steps in the right order, and never strayed from the norm, in order to awaken the creative and contemplative soul in the everyday woman. Which is wonderful and utterly commendable.This, to me, is not a book for the extremist, the eccentric, the serious rebel, the woman who saw a path and decided to blaze off through uncharted territory,eventually caught by the briars of life on that untread path. These people do not need advice on how to find themselves, or awaken creativity.Just one eccentric woman's 2 cents worth.
