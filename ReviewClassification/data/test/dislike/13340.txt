This trilogy ended horribly. It was like the author just found anything he could to wrap up each storyline. The whole trilogy wasn't great to begin with, but I trudged on. Book one got decent about halfway through, book two was alright, but book three was terrible.Honestly, I hope that someone gives the author some serious lessons in writing female characters and making male and female associations believable as throughout one of the biggest problems was his main characters relationships with his female characters. It was all fluff and cardboard. Teresa particularly was a cardboard cut out of a pretty young girl. That's it. She never developed into a real character.The other large problem was that his protagonist Tom is a weeny. Throughout the book he is erratic in his ability to take the lead which he often does not do despite the hints that he IS suppose to be the leader. And at the end AFTER he himself says he failed his friend Newt, even upon given a second chance, poor Newt has to SCREAM at him, begging for him to take care of the problem before he does it. Is this boy ever gonna MAN UP? Seriously. I guess we won't know because it ended with him being ushered to the next place by a girl with a secret, a secret he was too dumb to ever guess or figure out because he just wanted to be a wimp with his head in the freaking sand.I really wanted to like the series because I loved the concept, I suppose this was why I trudged on. But honestly, it was, meh. Mostly a disappointment.
