Back in junior high school, when I was being bussed 30 miles each way to the Magnet School for Gifted Math and Science Students (don't get excited; I washed out of the program in shame and disgrace after two years), theHitchhiker's Guideseries were all my nerdy friends' favorite books. They would throw quotes and in-jokes about Pan-Galactic Gargleblasters and Ravenous Bugblatter Beasts of Kraal back and forth at each other much like some (annoying) people like to do with Monty Python films orThe Princess Bride. For whatever reason, all the Douglas Adams-themed 7th grade nerd humor rubbed me the wrong way and I refused to read the books, which was an act of breathtaking contrarianism at the time.So recently, I decided it might be worthwhile to fill theHitchhiker's-shaped hole in my literary Great Wall, and I started reading the series.I think I might have been better off reading this book in 7th grade, because at age 36, what it did was irritate me, mostly. The constant wordplay seemed clumsy and unfunny, and most of the main characters sort of ran together. Worst of all, the plot was completely devoid of interest - I understand that the plot isn't supposed to be the central attraction in these books, but it's hard to muster up emotion over perilous situations when you just know the characters (whom you don't care much about to start with) are inevitably going to be bailed out by some zanydeus ex campus sinisterand zoom along to their next wacky adventure. It was like trying to get excited about watching other people ride a roller coaster.I can't remember the last time I had such a hard time finishing such a short book, but I'm actually glad I did because the last 50 pages or so were the best part.
