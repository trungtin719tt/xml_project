In response toGeoff's recent review of Part I:My amazing girlfriend gave me both volumes of Nabokov's translation of Onegin for xmas. She's a keeper.Oddly enough,myamazing girlfriend cross-examined me about how often I actually read Nabokov's translation of Onegin, the spine of which was suspiciously uncreased. On hearing my feeble answers, she put both volumes in the "To be donated" pile. And she's a keeper too.Moral: what we booknerds are looking for is someone who cares enough about Nabokov's translation of Onegin to have a strong opinion on the subject.
