Changing my rating from 2 stars to 1 star because every time I rewrite or add something to this review I'm instantly annoyed all over again.Okay, so this is the third time I'm going to rewrite this review. Then I'm going to walk away from it forever and not look back once.An Abundance of Katherinesfollows Collin Singleton, who has a very specific type of dream girl. Well, I guess not really since he only really likes girls named Katherine. I don't think he really cares what they look like. It's like he's instantly sold on the girl because of her name. If that doesn't creep you out then I have no idea what the hell will.He has dated about 19 girls all named Katherine. You'd think after being dumped 19ish times that he would give up on the name and move on. Nope, so he randomly goes on a road trip with his best friend Hassan. I have no idea why they did this all of a sudden but the trip didn't make me like his character anymore than I originally did.Yes, he sees and learns new things. However, this entire trip, NAH the whole damn book, was constantly repetitive. I didn't think I would grow to hate words while reading a book. Yet, John Green has done that thing - so, uh thanks?Then there's math part of this book. Okay, it's a formula that will somehow predict when two people will break up. I almost laughed when I wrote that sentence.. WHY? Because the future is unpredictable and it took Collin basically the whole book to figure that out and then to accept it.LE SIGH PEOPLE!Besides him obsessing over the name Katherine, he's annoying from start to finish of this book. He is constantly whining and it just annoyed me while reading. Even though he "changes" from this road trip he's still a twat to me.Overall, I didn't like this book. I also didn't like that I kept changing this review so many times. I didn't connect with any of the characters. Hell, I'm proud of all the Katherine's in the world that dumped him for his crazy obsession. I hope this guy sees a psychiatrist or something. He really needs one.I will never, repeat NEVER, reread this book ever again.I will never rewrite this review ever again.I'm done with this book FOREVER guys. I'm completely done with everything that it's about. Am I done with John Green? Maybe. Who knows?
