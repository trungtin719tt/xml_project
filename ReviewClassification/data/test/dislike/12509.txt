The most interesting part of this book was the introduction. Sad, but true.Four stars for presentation. The prose is nearly invisible, which I suppose in this genre is preferable to the alternative. And the content is mildly interesting, in a "Huh. Wouldja look at that" sort of way, as though you saw a duck waddling through your back yard with jam on its head.But insofar as it's meant to be the vehicle for a larger framework for viewing the world, this book is old news. You mean shit's connected in weird, roundabout ways? Get out. Conventional wisdom is oftenwrong? Superficial analyses are lazy and innacurate? My head...is spinning.Read some good poetry, you hipster fucks.
