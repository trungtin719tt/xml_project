I bought this book on a whim. All the ladies at my workplace seem to be reading it and I keep overhearing them rave about it. It's Nicholas Sparks best book yet! When I got up to the register the lady ringing me up said, "Ooh, Nicholas Sparks! I love his books. They're soo good. Oh, and look! It's going to be a movie. Gotta see that one." Mind you I had two other books in the pile, not a word about those.I didn't have high expectations for this book because it didn't seem like my kind of thing. But I figured it's good to expand one's horizons. I shouldn't be so judgmental. Maybe I'd have something to talk to my co-workers about, other than the weather or work.The story was OK. Definitely not bad. The love interest, Alex, was a nice guy, albeit too good to be true. But this is a Nicholas Sparks novel right? I assumed certain stereotypes would reign. His kids seemed cute and equally too good to be true. Our heroine, Katie, aka Erin, was also OK considering how annoying this character had potential to be and given that she was also a stereotype--blonde and lanky, skinny with big breasts (which is almost verbatim her physical description, as detailed, conveniently, by the bad guy). She's pretty much the mysterious hot chick with the dark past. But when the sh*t hit the fan, she's the one that took the bad guy out. That's cool. The bad guy, Kevin, was a decent enough villain-ignore some "too convenient coincidences" and he'll do in a pinch--and thanks to him the plot hummed along at a good pace. If we didn't have Kevin to hate, surely we'd be left with perfect Alex and perfect big-in-only-the-right-places Katie and there goes the entire plot.I read this book in one day because I did want to know where the author was going with this. Thus, I admit to taking the bait.The ending ruined it for me. The ending is dumb, contrived, unnecessary, insulting even. It made me feel stupid for spending the time to read this book. All the way until the end I was debating whether to give this book three stars or four because for all its faults (up until that point) it did keep me reading.Lesson learned. I'll just continue to make small talk about the weather any time someone wants to talk about a Nicholas Sparks book. Otherwise my opinionated side might rear its head and I'll be mobbed by angry secretaries.
