To celebrate William Shakespeare on his birthday in April, my plan is to locate a staging of six plays. I'll listen to and watch these on my MacBook, following along to as much of the original text as is incorporated by the production. Later, I'll read the entire play in the modern English version. A good friend I've had since high school recommended this system to me and it's been a very good system for delighting the mind in Shakespeare.Next up,The Taming of the Shrew. Because none of Shakespeare's manuscripts survive, there's rampant speculation as to the publishing dates and inspirations. It's believed this one was written sometime after Shakespeare arrived in London, perhaps between 1590 and 1594, placing it in the decade many of the Bard's comedies began to appear. And while there were already tales involving a cad who must woo a devilish woman, there's no indication Shakespeare based this play on other material.The staging I chose was the BBC Television Shakespeare production from 1980 starring John Cleese as Petruchio, Sarah Badel as Katherine, Simon Chandler as Lucentio and Susan Penhaligon as Bianca. Cleese is the only member of the cast I'm familiar with, and while the staging is extremely awkward -- actors routinely deliver their lines grouped in front of a static camera -- it proves amusing to draw lines between Shakespeare and Monty Python, two of England's premier artistic institutions.The Taming of the Shrewstarts well. In a delightfully meta induction, the drunkard Christopher Sly passes out in front of a tavern. He's discovered by a Lord and his hunting buddies who play a trick on him. The Lord has Sly carried to his home, where he's dressed and bathed and everyone in the house instructed to pretend that Sly's last fifteen years of vagrancy have been a dream. A group of actors arrive at the Lord's house and perform a play for the budding aristocrat ...The play within a play begins in the fair city of Padua, known for its arts and letters. A young nobleman from Pisa named Lucentio arrives with his quick-witted servant Tranio. Planning to further his education, Lucentio's noble priorities change when he checks out Bianca, youngest daughter of the wealthy Baptista Minola. Baptista deflects the advances of two suitors for Bianca's hand, Gremio and Hortensio, by declaring his youngest daughter will not marry until her sister Katherine is also wed.Katherine, known on the streets of Padua as Kate or Kate the Curst, has somehow avoided being burned at the stake as a witch, flinging insults at all those who come near her and throwing her fists around as well. Hortensio sees an opportunity to cast this devil out with the arrival of his old friend Petruchio, a wealthy gentleman of Verona who has inherited his late father's estate and gone to seek his fortune. When Petruchio hears of the rich dowry being offered for Katherine, he agrees to woo her.Meanwhile, Lucentio hatches a plot to win the affections of Bianca, whose father has indicated he would appreciate in a future son-in-law one who can offer a good tutor for his youngest daughter. Lucentio switches clothes with Tranio and poses as the servant, while Tranio introduces himself to Baptista as Lucentio, "vying" for Bianca's hand in marriage while contributing to the household a good "tutor" in Lucentio.While Petruchio waits to be introduced to Katherine, he hatches a strategy on how to seduce her.Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain she sings as sweetly as a nightingale. Say that she frown; I'll say she looks as clear as morning roses newly washed with dew. Say she be mute and will not speak a word. Then I'll commend her volubility. And say she utterth piercing eloquence. If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks as though she bid me stay by her a week. If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day when I shall ask the banns and when be married.Katherine puts up token resistance, hardly flattered by Petruchio's off-color barbs and condescending attitude towards her. She wastes no time in letting her father know how she feels.You have showed a tender fatherly regard to wish me wed to one half lunatic, a mad-cap ruffian and a swearing Jack, that thinks with oaths to face the matter out.Meanwhile, Lucentio drops his masquerade to Bianca during an intense Latin lesson; she's attracted to her man of words, but doesn't trust him yet. On her sister's wedding day, Petruchio is nowhere to be found. His servant, the fool Biondello, harkens the tardy arrival of his master, who appears in a ridiculous costume and later makes a mockery of the ceremony. Dragging Katherine home, he berates his servants and begins to wear down his wife's rebelliousness by seeing she can never relax.Rather than become enchanted by the play, I found myself cringing through it. Whatever narrative delights are here are cloaked by characters I despised. This is a violent play, with Kate laying into her younger sister with the sorts of domestic abuse that would allow Bianca to call the cops and press charges today, while Petruchio's solution seems to be to up the ante, dominating his bride and wearing her into total submission. Katherine's progression from a she-devil (who at least seems to be acting true to her nature) to a Stepford Wife is startling when you examine how liberated Shakespeare's female characters are: Beatrice inMuch Ado About Nothing. Portia inThe Merchant of Venice. Viola inTwelfth Night.Katherine is a victim. Watching her transition into a wife was like watching Paul Newman get captured inCool Hand Luke. Both characters are inflicted with such psychological torture by The Man that they become lobotomized. Where Cool Hand Luke later reveals he was faking the whole time in order to earn another opportunity to escape, there is no redemption for Katherine. She is beaten down and stands there. Not only is this an insult to women, it's not funny.The dialogue is witty and I did like the subterfuge Lucentio employs to woo Bianca (using books and knowledge as a seduction technique always goes over well with me). The B-plot there between Lucentio &amp; Bianca was far more engaging than the wrestling match between Petruchio &amp; Katherine. They're the couple you ditch after dinner as quickly as possible. It's based on some really antiquated notions about women appreciating the comfort and safety of being property, which again, isn't just out of date, but it isn't funny.Ten Things I Hate About You(1999) continued the Shakespeare revival going on in Hollywood at that time by transplanting the play to a modern day high school, with Julia Stiles as "Kat Stratford" and Heath Ledger as boy from the wrong side of the tracks who agrees to woo her so her father will let her younger sister Bianca date. A teen movie that doesn't suck, it does suck being reminded that Ledger is no longer with us.
