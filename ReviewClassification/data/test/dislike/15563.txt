I guess it's pretty cheeky to give the Bible a bad review, but why not?It's boring, self-contradictory, petty, and mean.I only read it out of some kind of weird obligation to understand how the other 98% lives.I did learn a lot, however.If guests come by and want to rape my angel, I will let them rape my daughter.So say we all!
