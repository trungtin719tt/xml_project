Lame. After a promising start with The Maze Runner, this book tries to keep the tension going by not answering any of the questions set up by its predecessor. Unfortunately, this just means it devolves very quickly into not making any sense and the characters lose what little they had to talk about in the first book. So the main character just blunders through a bunch of stuff asking questions that never get answered and repeating the entire story of the first book to everyone he meets. Like, literally! If you cut out all the monologues that are just a synopsis of what's already happened, this book would be half the length. Still confusing and lame, but shorter.
