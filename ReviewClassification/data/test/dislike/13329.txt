Ok, first off I'm going to say that I loved Maze Runner and Scorch Trials. I've been waiting for this final book for a long time. The author does a great job with fast-paced writing and action-packed scenes. The mysteries and puzzles were what intrigued me about this trilogy in the first place. Right as you're trying to get one thing straight in your head, another crazy mind trick gets thrown at you, making you shake your head and ask a bunch of questions again. So I was so excited to finally read death cure and get those answers.Okay....now, the way this book failed for me was twofold. First, the characters. I loved Thomas. I loved that he was smart and selfless and loyal and compassionate. But he lost all of those qualities to me in Death Cure. He didn't trust Wicked. Ok, I get that--but to not want to get his memories back? Come on. He just chose ignorance over knowledge and I don't think that was true to his character. Then he rejected Teresa the whole time which I felt was unwarranted since after scorch. I think the author did their relationship a complete disservice. I'm still mad about it. I never liked Brenda and I'm disappointed that Thomas ended up with her. I mean, come on, she obviously had a double agenda the whole time, and yet he trusted her and not Teresa. Blech. Okay, and then there was Minho. He used to be funny, despite the circumstances. Nope, no more. And then there's poor Newt. His storyline was good, but the final scene between he and Thomas was just as quick as the rest of the book, and it was a shame. Fast is good, but not when the scene is as meaningful as that one. Oh and his note? I thought it was a cop-out. And I'm supposed to believe that Wicked would just let Thomas wander around Denver and not come get him because the virus was too rampant? They supposedly have unlimited money and resources, and we're led to believe they watch his every move, yet when he returns to Wicked at the end, he just goes to the bathroom and plants the disabling device? No one notices? And then when he's getting the immunes out of the maze, why didn't the other Gladers try to leave before? If everything was disabled, why wouldn't Gally and frypan and the B girls try to escape? I could go on and on.Okay, now the second reason the book failed to me. The questions. Really? No more answers? No explaining why Thomas was chosen or how he trained the Creators. Nothing about he and Teresa or their parents or chuck or how the rest of the world is. I mean, the virus makes people zombies and a Candidate's brain was supposed to cure that? Okay... And then they just end up in a green paradise with a hundred or so immunes so they can start over? And the chancellor just happened to save him right before his brain removal and leave him a map but doesn't go to the paradise herself? Seriously.... There were so many things that didn't add up. So many questions that were answered haphazardly or not at all. Oh and I could have done without Thomas and Brenda staring off into the sunset at the end. I so don't like her. Now they're in another Glade all over again. At least before, I actually liked Thomas. I'm so disappointed because I wanted so badly to like this...I'm totally bummed :(
