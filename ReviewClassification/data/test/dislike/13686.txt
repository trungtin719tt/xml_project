All in all, Gwen annoyed the shit out of me (she was idiotic), there are giant, gaping plot holes, and while I understand a lot of these will probably be answered in the other two books (it certainly feels like part one of a big story, instead of having its own seperate arc within a bigger picture), it just wasn't enough to be satisfying. Like, what is the point of only travelling in time for 2 minutes or whatever at a time if this time travelling gene is so rare? What is the point. The time travelling aspect of this was super simplified and just didn't have enough detail for my liking.Also, while I understand this was translated, the writing was a fucking catastrophe and Gwen/Lesley etc sounded like 12 year old girls through their dialogue.The mystery aspect of this was enough to keep my reading though so I think I will continue with the series, if only to get some answers!
