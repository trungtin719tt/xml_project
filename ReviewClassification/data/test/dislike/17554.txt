I'm done. This book annoyed me in ways I didn't think were possible. Was I really thinking thatthisbook would be any better than the last one? God, I'm such a retard. There are so manymanymany different ways that this got under my skin, but I won't drag this review out. Instead, let me just sum up the entire experience for you with one example of the bizarro hell that is...Awakened.(view spoiler)[ Jack, the requisite bubbly sweet gay guy (for the record I'd like to see more surly gay guys in literature. Not every freakin' gay dude prances around being kind and sweet! I'm just saying.) gets the axe in this book. Sad, right? Noooo. Oh, there were tears running down my face, but they were the tears oflaughter. Only, I don't think it was supposed to be funny. See, the evil chick needs to sacrifice an innocent incorruptible soul (duh! the natural choice is the gay guy!), so she ensnares Jack in her voodoo web of Darkness. He knows he is going to die, and begins to make his peace with death.*cue dramatic music*No. Seriously.Cue dramatic music!He then proceeds to sing a song. A song that he heard on the tv show, Glee. I've never seen Glee. So how do I know it's from Glee? 'Cause that's what it says in the book. Yes. Apparently, him singing the male part of a duet from this show should have brought me to my emotional knees. It didn't. Unless you count that I had to pick myself up off the floor, because my sides hurt from spasming so hard with laughter...that I fell over.GLEE?! Are you #@$*ing serious?! Bwahahahahhaha! Ah, *wipes tear* I take it all back.Thatscene alone was worth reading the entire book!(hide spoiler)]
