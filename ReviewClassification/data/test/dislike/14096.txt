That was... something. Right, I guess it was ok.How did vampires become common knowledge? I understand they became legal 2 years prior to the action in the book, but why? How?And who is Anita Blake? I could not connect with her at all. She felt shallow... No, not shallow. I really can't find the word right now... She felt not real, but someone that simply went with the flow, with no actual starting point, or purpose. I would like to say she felt like a character in a book, but I love books, so that would be insulting to them.And how on Earth(view spoiler)[did two humans with no spectacular powers kill a 1000 years old vampire? The vampire must have been extremely stupid because she went down so fast. I usually like vampires very much, but the ones in Guilty Pleasures are idiots in spite of having great power.(hide spoiler)]Anyway, something good did come out of all of this as I started re-reading the Night Huntress series.
