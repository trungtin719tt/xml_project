I was actually wooed into reading this book by aglowing review. I wish my experience had come even a little bit close to how that reader felt about the book, because I wouldn't have ended up feeling like my time had been wasted.And honestly, this was a huge slog. Not caring much about fly-fishing or lumberjacking, I didn't start out primed to enjoy the content. But some authors are still able to pull me in with strength of characters or an interesting story, even with settings or scenarios I am not immediately won over by. In this case, that just didn't happen.There are three stories in this book, although two are more like novellas. A River Runs Through It is best known, also because there is a film based on it (which I know for sure I don't care to see). It has a very poetic ending with a tone that I wish had run through more of the story:"Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.I am haunted by waters."It is the infrequent moments of poetic reverence of nature that I connect with the most. In the storyUSFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Skyis a concept of mountains moving, and how watching them do so can be calming, centering. I liked the image of a little boy looking out his window waiting to recover from an illness, watching the mountains.And a quote to use in my storytelling class:"It is almost impossible... to quit a story once you have become a character in it."Even though I didn't really like this book, in my quest to read a book set in every state, this was probably a good pick for Montana. The stories feel like big-sky stories, and people more connected to the landscape of that area of the country might resonate with them more. I'll be happy to pass the book on to someone who might enjoy it.
