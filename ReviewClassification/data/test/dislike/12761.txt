I learned that Dan Brown is a bad writer and I will never read any of his other books. I also am upset at my friend for recommending me this book.In short, the book is a bad novel, and a very bad novel if you know anything about math / cryptography.Not only the technical errors were appalling, but the writing style itself is mediocre.WARNING: spoiler here.There is a scene where the heads of NSA along with some of the smartest people on Earth were trying to solve a riddle left by the bad guy as a clue. It took them a whole chapter to solve the riddle, these people who with IQ of supposedly 170+. But I, a reader with average IQ and no formal training in cryptography, knew instantly what the riddle is all about. How is that realistic? either Dan Brown's IQ is below average, or it doesn't take that much to become the head of NSA. I opt for the former.The character development is weak, no strong plot lines, and the dialogs were so bad they could have been written by me. Total waste of time. The only fun I got from this book was the time I wrote this review to bash it.
