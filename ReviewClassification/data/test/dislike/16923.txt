I wanted to at least be able to like this book, but, alas, it was not to be. Too vulgar for my tastes. I wonder if someone could write a vampire book without all the erotic/ voyeuristic passages, or is that too much a part of the nature of the vampiric myth?Seriously, I liked the plot. The characters were at least interesting. The way it was written, I was not expecting Bianca to be the vampire, even though I had seen and noted the clues. I just was determined to believe that it was everyone else, including Lucas. So, against my wishes and expectations, it turns out Bianca is the dangerous and damned one. But the "love" story was downright disgusting after a point and, just, ick!Balthaszar was a more nuanced character that I did really like. But if he really hates his existence as a vampire so much, why doesn't he allow the Black Cross to just take him out?Don't expect much from the sequel, Stargazer, but I'll give it a shot when its released. If it continues in the same vein, though, I am not going to finish it.
