I enjoyed the book over all, but I was expecting a lot more from it. The characters were really cool but I did not like the protagonist. I thought she was too complacent and lacked the strength that most chic-lit protagonists have. She was naive, and extremely hard on herself which made her slightly annoying to read about. However, I liked the way they show her development from someone who needs constant support to someone who is a source of comfort to her friends in time of need.The cast of characters was amazing, especially Forney. He became her knight in shinning armor since he was always there to take care of her and provide support. Moses Whitecotton and Sister Husband were very interesting as well because they were very eccentric and provided a contrast to Novalee's character.The developments in the plot bout Willy Jack were interesting and they gave a nice break from Novalee's life, the parts of his story kept me on my toes and provided supense to the story.I liked the book, but I think if it were written in first-person then it would have seemed more expressive and less cheesy.
