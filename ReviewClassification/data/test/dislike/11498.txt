The paperback edition of what is the sixth book in theOutlanderseries is over 1500 pages long and sorry to say, I did not hang on every word. Who could? There's so damn many of them! Talk about bloated. Diana Gabaldon's editor must love her a lot, or is just too nice for the business. "Kill your darlings" -- remember that timeless piece of advice from Mark Twain?I love Jamie and Claire (not so much Roger and Brianna) and have been hooked sinceOutlander, but the series is floundering, and has been for some time. I could not even finish the fifth book,The Fiery Cross. As forBreath of Snow and Ashes, how many times can any handful of people escape from prison, mob scenes, near death, kidnappings, etc, etc. Maybe I'm just cranky because while I was reading this tome, I could have finished at least four other books on my to-read list. But I sacrificed, I persevered, and I wanted to LOVE this book, I really did. But alas, it was not meant to be.There was enough Jamie and Claire antics, and classic Gabaldon humor, to recommend this title, but only to hardcoreOutlanderfans. Remember, 1500 pages is a huge chunk of prose which translates into a huge investment of your precious reading time. Approach with caution.
