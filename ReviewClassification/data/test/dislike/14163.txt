Well, dang it.Dang it!I was NOT in the mood to give another scathing review of a book, especially not a book that has a near cultish fan following, as this one does.This is a seriously beloved book (with a 4.17 overall rating).But, for the first time in my existence on this planet, I'm going to quote Whitesnake:Here I go again on my ownGoin' down the only road I've ever knownLike a drifter I was born to walk alone.And I've made up my mind, I ain't wasting no more time.Yep, that's right. I just quoted an 80s band with bad hair, 'cause I'm in my 40s now, people, and "I ain't wasting no more time."The people who adore this book treat it almost like a coveted lover.Well, let me tell you, friends, if this had been MY lover. . .We wouldn't have made it past appetizers.It took ME, a wicked fast reader, almost 5 days to make it to page 88. Then on that page, there's a brief moment of glory in the plot, and I thought to myself. . . okay, it's going to take off now! Nope. No it didn't.And, if this type of slow-moving plot and character development is Ms. Russell's version of literary foreplay, I say. . . it's time to tap this lover on the shoulder and tell him, "Let's be done, dear. It's obvious that no one's going to climax today."
