Man alive, I hated that book. Again, I procrastinated and tried to jam the whole book into one weekend, since I had an oral book review due on Monday for history or social studies or something. God, why can't I even remember the name of the class? My sister will know. It was in high school, junior year, and the teacher - who later became our mayor wtf! - was totally hot. Balding, tan, charismatic, awesome. Every summer, he'd mow his yard. Shirtless. Good god, y'all. And he had a daughter in my grade, so he was *totally* in the Old Enough To Be Your Dad zone, which was creepy and yet completely awesome when you're 16 or 17 and crushing like crazy on him, which half of everybody was.So anyway! Read this book as one of the required oral book reviews in his class, which was a before-or-after class thing, one-on-one, which made me want to crawl into a hole and die from nerves, since it was him. Totally great.None of this made the book any good. The movie was better. Go watch the movie. The book would spend like 25 pages on describing crap like what every freakin' stone and pebble looked like while going down a path omg zzzzzzzzzz.In conclusion: Book report with hot teacher which makes you think of that Lolita-y song by The Police? Awesome. Picking this book for it? Not so much.
