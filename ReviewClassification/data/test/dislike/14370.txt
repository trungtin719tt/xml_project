This book confirmed for me that Bukowski only tells the one story. That one story generally takes the form of several of the same stories over again, with different surroundings and characters. This book is about many of the jobs Chinaski works in between drinking, writing, and screwing. Women, on the other hand, is about the many women he screws in between drinking and writing. There may be a greater thread of illumination I am missing, but that's all I have to say about it.This is not to say that the book is not enjoyable. I also found Women enjoyable, but moreso than Factotum because sex &gt; work. I found Hollywood most enjoyable of all because it's about his older days, and cranky old people &gt; cranky young people. I haven't read Ham on Rye (evidently about his childhood/teen years) but in the right mood, I'd be interested in reading about Bukowski Before Chinaski. It seems that despite, well, many things, Bukowski/Chinaski inspires a strange sympathy, which I sincerely hope is not one of the many burdens of being a straight female.Which is why I still don't classify Bukowski as Dick Lit, though I'm sure many people who love Dick Lit also love Bukowski. Chinaski may be relentlessly destructive but he is at least up front about his desires, unlike the insufferable soul searchers of contemporary male fiction who kid themselves into thinking they are seeking a higher destiny in life, when really they are seeking love, acceptance and other conventional comforts. At least Chinaski never hides the ball: "I have followed so many women up stairways like that, always thinking, if only some nice lady like this one would offer to take care of me and feed me warm tasty food and lay out clean stockings and shorts for me to wear, I would accept." His crisis is generally physical rather than existential, which is a relief in a man book.Also, though I'm in the habit of buying used books, this was the first book that ever compelled me to wash my hands after reading.2.5 stars = "I kinda liked it."
