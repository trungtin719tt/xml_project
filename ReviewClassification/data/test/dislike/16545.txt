King may be the master of horror and suspense, but his work as a romance novelist is a failure.The main story of The Dark Tower goes off the rails (yes, pun intended for those who have read this) and wallows in 500 pages of Roland's backstory - a young-love yarn with a sprinkling of occasional action that just didn't work on any level. King wrote like he was getting paid by the word (He was very frightened. Very frightened indeed.) - and the whole  ridiculous Wizard of Oz story tie-in just smacked of laziness. Had King really run out of ideas and needed to use other's for a book that really didn't do much to move the overall story forward?But now I am committed to finishing this series because I'm kinda hoping the Dark Tower just wipes out all these jokers. Ka, indeed.
