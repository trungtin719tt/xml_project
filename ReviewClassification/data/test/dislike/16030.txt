A friend of mine kept bugging me to read Nicholas Evans, and I finally gave in and got his first novel -The Horse Whisperer. It was made into a movie with the everbeautiful Scarlett Johansonn which I saw years ago and enjoyed, though it didn't leave any lasting impression. When it came to the book I wasn't impressed.With an interesting premise - girl coming back to health after an accident during horse riding, a "whisperer" called to heal the horse - it soon became cliched and predictable. The interesting process with the girl coming back to health after the accident, and the dreamy cowboy is trying to heal the horse and make it trust people again was soon switched by Evans for a corny Hollywood romance. The story moves to focus on the girl's unlikable mother, who is said to love her husband dearly, but for some reason just has to hump the dreamy cowboy who soon realizes that the lady is hot for him and he's hot for her.There's little here that wasn't done before and it is not done in any spectacular way. The ending to the story is so bizarrely ridiculous that I wouldn't really recommend this novel to anyone.
