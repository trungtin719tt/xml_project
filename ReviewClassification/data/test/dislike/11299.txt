The only character I like is Ronan. Which is... very ironic.It might be time for Maggie Stiefvater and I to part ways.Truly, there's nothing actually ''wrong'' with her style; it simply does not appeal to me. But this is the kind of story that I feel would be read in a better way if written in the 1st person point of view instead of 3rd. There is this possibility to feel connected to the protagonists... but a slim and invisible barrier seems to continuously block that connection. Even for Ronan. I may ''like'' him and I might've enjoyed reading about him, but I surely don't ''love'' his character. He has too much of a poorly explained and justified negativity and bad behaviour.Oh well, it happens. Onto the next one.
