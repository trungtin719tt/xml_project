Where to begin withRunning With Scissors? I had read it way back in the 10th grade and disliked it, but decided to go back and try to re-read it to see if I'd missed something. What's worse? The lawsuit against Burroughs from the "Finch" Family, especially "Natalie", who never wanted her private domestic and sexual abuse revealed to the public? Some friend Augusten Burroughs is! Or maybe it's simply how vulgar and totally random he is as a writer. No, it's really not necessary (and I suspect not true in the least) to write about your childhood pal(view spoiler)["mashing her vagina up against the window"(hide spoiler)]to ward off visitors to your house (who the hell would do this? And no, it's not humorous, it's just gross and very bizarre). No, I don't think it's fair to take people who are mentally ill or dead and use them as fodder for your own fame, no matter how much you hated them growing up. Augusten Burroughs as a narrator is also about as endearing as climbing into a bucket of live cockroaches. The guy is painfully full of himself, self-indulgent and convinced he's somehow had the worst childhood of any kid on the planet. He also writes as if he's above the instability of his purportedly dysfunctional family, yet considering almost his entire career and livelihood is based off writing these memoirs about how horrible they were, I think these books are his way to keep it going and drag out the drama.I don't personally know Augusten Burroughs so I'm not going to pretend I'm an expert on what he went through, but if what he writes about is true, there'sno way in hellit went unnoticed and unreported, yet nobody who lived around the "Finch" Family or around Augusten's mother seem to recall any of this stuff occurring. I think the Finches were a bit nonconformist and bohemian, and I think Augusten's parents were going through a messy divorce. But give me a break. Waking up with naked mental patients in Christmas hats? Sleeping with a schizophrenic adult man (who oddly enough seems to not exist)? Being told by a doctor to commit suicide so you don't have to go back to public school? A doctor having a room in his house called(view spoiler)[the "masturbatorium"(hide spoiler)]? Andnobodyever noticed any of this, reported any of it? Augusten never tried to run away? And the few characters hedoeslike, such as Agnes, he still writes about with a rather cruel and callous amount of disdain. There's something very weird, crude and fake about this whole book. Either it was written as a cash grab or the author found it humorous to write this way by embellishing and it went too far. For the record, I've seen stuff by his real mother, both her poetry writings and her personal accounts, and there's no way she's the same lady(view spoiler)[sleeping around and getting STD's from some random guy, then openly telling her own son about it(hide spoiler)]who is featured in this book. But even ifRunning With Scissorswere a true story, it wouldn't make it any less disgusting and unappealing.
