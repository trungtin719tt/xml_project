some of the worst books, ever, god bless them!i derive a sort of masochistic pleasure in reading them. i actually didn't read them, i listened to them. i couldn't actually spend that time simply reading....i was reading and doing yardwork, or knitting, or something productive.these books suck! oh god, do they suck.they had potential for excellent apocalyptic death, disaster and destruction...but they were too heavy on the finding-jesus part, and too light on the destruction part. stephen king should have written these.still....one of these days i have to find out what happens when jesus comes back! does rayford steele turn into a beam of light and float up into the heavens? perhaps a pillar of salt? who can know.
