I read 549 pages and that was the reveal? Really?God, I was bored. I only stuck it out because I figured the book had to be building up to something. And I suppose that technically, it was. Just not anything particularly interesting or worth waiting for. I get it, everyone in the book has mother/child abandonment issues.I think this book really wanted to beThe Thirteenth Tale, but didn't have the balls (if you pardon the inaccurate expression, what with how female-centric both titles are). Nowthatbook had a deeply buried family secret worth reading about.The writing wasn't terrible, and since I was able to sit through all 549 (FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY NINE) pages, this one gets a whole extra star. It wasn't bad, it was just blah.(That said, I'm pretty sure I would read a book about Georgiana, the original lost mother, but of course that was the story that wasn't really told in long, boring, drawn-out detail. She sounded like fun.)
