the characters weren't people, just mental illnesses put into bodies. "quirky" but in reality mentally ill. not cool. nobody treated the characters' problems like they were real problems and that pissed me offfffhowever, if you enjoyed the book/could relate to the characters, that's totally fine. this one just wasn't for me unfortunately.
