What a piece of shit. Chuck Buck prides himself as a worthless human filled with anger and bitterness towards all his fellow men. He has no respect for women or anyone else for that matter, and drinks himself into a state of absolute despair just so he can write about his depressive life in order to persuade the rest of the public to feel better about themselves (I assume). Bile. Waste. A foul excuse for contemporary literature- it's more like contemptuous literature. I'm embarrassed his writing is considered "hip". It just made me sad. Granted, this was the first Bukowski novel I've read. It should be a while before I pick up another one. Anyone out there disagree? - I'd like to hear about it.
