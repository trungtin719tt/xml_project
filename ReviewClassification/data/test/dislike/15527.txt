ay yi yi. I've been with Sookie since 2004 when I read the first 5 books back to back. Loved it. Quirky southern characters, good suspense plots and occasional steam thrown in for good measure. The last book (book 8) seemed to be a bridge book leading to an exciting turn of events in this one. No go. This book started funny (What Not To Wear for Vamps, lol), but soon got booooorrrring. Sookie is tired and 'blood bonded' to Eric (my choice for a mate, fo sho), so she never gets angry anymore. Perhaps a good thing, because she was always yelling in the older books. The were community decides to come out to the world, like the vamps, and, wait for it, there is NO backlash? huh? Instead, we're treated to a vague war with the fae where Sookie, having 1/6th blood is THE target? what? The whole war is over in, seriously, 3 minutes?Shamefully, Charlaine Harris, you let HBO overblooded/sexed/drugged your charming southern vampire series and you've given your books ambien. Unless you pick up the responsibility flag and fix things, you've lost me.
