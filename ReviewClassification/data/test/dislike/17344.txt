Reading the back cover and realizing the backdrop is suicide, I was sorely disappointed by the lack of self-face stabbings.Again, picking up this book, I thought to myself, suicide and Mitch Albom... how could I go wrong? But I was wrong (snicker) dead wrong.From the beginning, Albom signifies his attachment to this book. He is telling this story from notes and interviews he may have had with the main character. Why is this important? Could the book have been equally effective without him putting himself in the story? Does it seem a tad forced?Albom takes special care to make the cover story stick. His presence is felt in the narrative with the imprint of attributary notes: this was taken from this. The end mentions how the book is a compilation of three years' worth of work, talking with the main character. How does this effect the narrative? Is anybody being used? Is this story true? Is the reader being used? If a reader likes this book for its content is it because of the main character or Albom's journalistic spirit?Without these questions, the book itself is decent. The idea of someone coming back for a brief time for a conversation or such is endearing. The vehicle chosen to represent it however, is cliche. Once the motion signifying what's happening (trying to avoid spoilers) appears, suspension of belief is dropped. The mystery of what's going to happen is succinct. The story continues quite a bit after this, attaching great value to the relationship between mother and son.More than anything this is an homage to parents and what they can do for/to you.
