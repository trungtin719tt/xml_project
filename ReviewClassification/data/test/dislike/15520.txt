***Spoiler Alert***I was okay with the book until about 20 pages to go and then all hell broke loose. What is the point of telling us Claudine is pregnant if you are going to kill her two pages later?!?! Just let Sookie, and us, think she is knitting a sweater for an elf, or gnome or whatever! We don't need two pregnant women killed in one book. I am not okay with how "eh" the deaths were taken in this book either. I hate the way Dawson's death was treated, and then the drug dealer rumor. Tray was a good man and should not have gone that way. Pin it on FotS freaks because he was a Were. And speaking of FotS, get rid of Arlene, I have been tired of that woman since book one and eight books later I hate her even more. Mel didn't technically kill Crystal, they admitted she died on the cross and that had nothing to do with the Weres but the damn Fairies, which is far fetched even for this series. OH If she breaks Eric's heart and gets back with Bill I am done with this series. The ONLY reason I gave it two stars, ERIC!!
