Oh for goodness sake.I know I'm going against the grain here, as a lot of people rated this book so highly, but surely I can't be the only one so disappointed in it?I usually love Kate Morton's books but this one just dragged and dragged whilst rehashing the same story. At first I thought it may be because I was listening to the audible version, but then remembered that I'd listened to 'The Distant Hours' too and had really enjoyed it.The story hinted at deep, dark secrets, but there weren't really any. I had guessed the mystery of who Nell's mother was very early on and it was so obvious that I can't imagine that the author didn't mean to tell us which is bizarre. There was some weirdness hinted at about an Uncle that never materialised and the standard romance between two paint-by-numbers characters that was flat and uninspiring. The majority of the protagonists were unlikable or simply so dull that you didn't care for their fate anyway. The epilogue was trite.I'm sorry Kate Morton, I usually enjoy your books but after 21 hours of listening to this I feel slightly robbed of my time. I feel awful for this review, but hopefully it will direct readers towards her other books instead which are far superior in my view.2.5 stars.
