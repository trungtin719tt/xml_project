I'm DNF'n this book at 30% and I hate not finishing a book but I just can't bring myself to read anymore of it!Not only is Elena a horrible self-centred bitch after one night of kissing Stefan the next morning she's Florence nightingale! I can't stand her not even a little argh!!!!!!!! Love someone you don't even know?! GET A GRIP CRINGE!
