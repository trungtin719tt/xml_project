This is the first book in another paranormal YA series. I've been disappointed with quite a few lately, but "Blue Bloods" seems a little bit better than some.First of all, it's not based solely on romance. For a change, this book is written in 3rd person, so you don't have to endure hundreds of pages in a mind of some boy-obsessed teenage girl. Cruz also develops a rather interesting vampire lore which even has some well-known historical events weaved into it.I am not going to pretend however that this book is something extra special. The characterization is superficial, Cruz spends way too much time describing every piece of clothing ever worn by anyone in the book, the brand name dropping is just beyond ridiculous, and emphasis on money and advantages of being rich makes characters at times unrelatable and distant. Yeah, and there is almost no climax or a satisfying ending.Nevertheless, this book is a page-turner and I am interested enough in the story to give the rest of the series a try.
