This is not the sort of book I would read by choice, but a patron was so enthusiastic about recommending it to me, even lending me a personal copy, that I felt obligated.I'll say the same thing about ILLUSIONS that I said about THE SHACK--if this book speaks to you and helps you deal with the travails of life, great. Enjoy it. But it's just not me. For the most part, I don't care for books that attempt to impart some grand wisdom on the meaning of life and metaphysical matters.
