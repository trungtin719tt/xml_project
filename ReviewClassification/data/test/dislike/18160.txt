I'm glad I read this book so that in the future I can tell people just how awful it is.Of course I've heard of the author's reputation, along with that of the movie version of the book, so I was very eager to read and savor this book to find out exactly how wonderful it really was.Here's my summary: privileged, naval-gazing student meets presumptuous windbag, believes him to be answer to his navel-gazing problems, women are denigrated left and right, reader is left awed at how this ever became popular.Really, it just is astonishingly bad to contemporary sensibilities. Maybe when this was first published in 1946 (then in English in 1951/2) it was a breath of fresh air narrative, but whatever was hailed as inspiring or positive about the Zorba character has, 65 years later, been lost to time and he's now reduced to a caricature of someone who is so chauvinistic that nothing is redeemable at all, even if one or two of the things he says are aphorism worthy.But the other 99.9% isn't worth anything. Want to know what his views on women are? They're weak, they don't know anything, they're easily won over if you grab their breasts (really!), all a woman needs is a man between her legs (especially if they're widows!), and in fact they're happy and grateful and melt if any man gives them any attention (which they should be grateful for because, really, men are doing them a favor). And so on. For 300 pages.One woman's emotions are played with for the main characters' amusement, but that's okay because she's just an old whore who should be happy to have any attention at all since she's just an old, fat lady (who's described as such in a hundred different ways, every other adjective involving an animal in some way).Another women is beheaded (her HEAD is CUT OFF and thrown into a church courtyard!) because she basically refused a man's attention and everyone in the town is okay with it because it was the right thing to do. The narrator bravely deals with it by saying it was justified since a thousand years ago it was okay, so never mind that it happened just now! in front of his eyes!The book is just a terrible mess of male-centered egocentricity. And really, the whole subplot with the "Sodomite" monk killing another monk and getting away with it is strange since the most intimate scenes and relationships happen between men. Was it meant to condemn homosexual relations? Was it meant to condemn the religious community for allowing the murder and abuse to occur? Are the terrible people who inhabit the village to be exalted or reviled by the reader? Is someone really supposed to find Zorba's zeal for life inspiring (as long as you forget all the bad stuff he says and does, including raping women!).Truly awful.
