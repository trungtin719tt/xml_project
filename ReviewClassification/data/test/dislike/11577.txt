It's been awhile since I have so totally hated a book.I'm surprised at how varied the feelings on here about this book are...some of my friends hated it.Some of them liked/loved it.I still love them....Let's get to why I hated this so very frigging much.The main character is a twit...but then the whole family is:Welcome to the beautiful Sinclair family.No one is a criminal.No one is an addict.No one is a failure.The Sinclairs are athletic, tall and handsome.That's actually the good part on her family. In some parts of the book the author tries and make the character act like she has redeeming qualifications-but then a short few pages later I just want to smash her again.The writing style:Good grief..I thought it was only going to last for a few pages. NOOOOOOO, almost the whole frigging book is written like this...."So lie. Tell him the ones from the Boston house. The cream ones with the embroidery."It was easiest to tell her I would.And later, I told her I had.But Bess has asked Mirren to do the same thing,and neither one of usbegged Granddadfor the fucking tablecloths.Then that lovely twist of an ending:I'm probably going to hell for this but don't click if you gonna whine...(view spoiler)[I thought it was the burning of the housebut noooooo...it's that they are all fucking dead..except for princess dumbass. She would be seeing dead people cuz that head of her's was fucking empty of anything else.(hide spoiler)]There's one part I never did figure out. Cady the main character keeps talking about bleeding..Did she cut or was that just supposed to be a metaphor or some crap?Now after reading this crap I need:And lastly..for the trolls and fangirls and gif haters (should have thrown that one in) that will come....GO suck monkey ass..this book sucks!
