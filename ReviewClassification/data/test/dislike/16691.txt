This book is preposterous, degrading, and offensive to strong women everywhere.There. If you disagree passionately with that statement, youwillbe offended by what follows.You've been warned.Oh yeah, and spoilers ahead, because I don't really care enough about thisIdiot Plotenough not to give it all away. Capice? Good. You may proceed.The worst part of Nightshade is that I actually liked the basic concepts. The notion of a world populated and semi-controlled by witches and werewolves, with incubi and chimerae and all that other good stuff- that interests me. I could go with that. So it's a shame to see that ruined by a cast of characters that made my blood boil, and plot that involved most of said cast being stereotyped and/or just plain willfully ignorant, and the only exception being stereotyped and occasionally douchebaggey.But the one I really want to talk about is Calla.At first, I was glad to see her characterized the way she is. A female alpha, a warrior, in command of her pack? GIRL POWER!...right?What followed was an argument between me and this book. Went something like this.Me: GIRL POWER!Book: GIRL POWER!Me: So, because Calla's full of win and GIRL POWER, she's going to stand up to Ren and be his equal, right?Book: Sure, since he says that's the way he wants it.Me: ...what?Book: Well, obviously male alphas have authority even over the females. You know, like in real wolf societies?Me: Yes, but these are WEREwolves. They've got to have been influenced by feminism, right?Book: No, they don't. I don't want them to. Then I wouldn't get my enthusiastically flity/feminine best friend, or the stereotyped tomboy bitch, or the empty shell of a girl who follows said tomboy bitch around.Me: And Calla?Book: Calla's an ALPHA. GIRL POWER!Me: Yes, but no. See, she's very clearly an alpha in name only. Everyone- even her own pack before the union- defers to Ren. At times, they stand up to her and basically tell her to go to hell with her commands. IF she was an alpha with GIRL POWER, she would keep them in line and actually behave like a leader. Instead, she lets everyone steamroller her- from Ren to Shay even when he's human. She's never in control of her life, and she hesitates to take control. For an alpha, she's not assertive in the least. All it takes is a little kissing for her to give up every thought in her head, if she had one in the first place.Book: ...Me: And then there's her mother. You know what part bothered me most? I marked it specifically. "You cannot cross an alpha male, even when you belong to another. You risk your own life to do so." That's what Naomi tells her daughter after Ren's father has been sexually harassing her. Now, I understand the point in the society of the Guardians. BUT. Look at the larger message. You know what she's saying?"If the men are stronger than you, you become their possession, and others of that level of strength may also possess you unless your owner man fights for you."Well, book.Here's my response.FUCKTHATSHIT.Book: Have an angsty ending?Me: NO. GO DIE.And that's pretty much it. I would have been less insulted if Calla hadn't been an 'alpha'; by putting her in a position of assumed power and then subverting it, Cremer made her even weaker and more of an affront to true strong women.
