I know that this rating of mine is going to be highly unpopular because this specific book seems to have enchanted loads and loads of people. It has an average rating of 4.17 stars here in Goodreads, and while I was reading it people kept sharing their love for this book and this author."The Forgotten Garden" was my first book by Kate Morton, and I think it's going to be my last as well. That's because I have a feeling that once you've read one of her books, you know what her stories and her writing style is like. It's not bad at all, but it's reminiscent of so many other authors and books I've read which seem predictable and bland to me and don't really leave that much of an impression.This novel is most definitely going to be one of those novels that will stay with me for some time to come, because thinking back on it there were some points of it and some characters that I appreciated and that made me continue reading. However, my actual reading of this book left me utterly bored throughout most of it, and I was tempted to give up at several moments.The thing is that this is a 646-page book and it is structured in a way that makes you realize how it's all going to play out, right from the beginning. It's a mystery family novel going back and forth in time, leaving you with hints and bits of the whole story. Therefore, you know right from the beginning that you'll have to read all 600 pages before you get the full picture - and what's the excitement of that?A lot of the characters were predictable and caricatured in my opinion. We have the loving granddaughter, the posh mother, the mysterious father, etc. Once again, the characters didn't provide me with much excitement. However, the thing that made me keep reading were two young girls whom we don't really encounter until halfway through the book. Those girls were enchanting, and the way their destinies interweave with well-known fairy tales was beautiful.I know this might be a shock to a lot of people, but this was such a disappointment. While I do see why some people might find it captivating, I just wasn't one to share that opinion.
