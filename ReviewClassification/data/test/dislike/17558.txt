I am so done with this series. It really should have ended two books ago, now it's just dragging on. Plus, I'm still pissed about the who Eric Night thing. It seems pretty bitchy that Zoe after sleeping with another guy decided that he's the immature one because he's jealous of her several boy toys. so not cool and such a horrible message to send to teens. goddess or not stringing along several guys is bad.I also did not buy Stevie Ray and her mother scene. There is no reason that she shouldn't have told her mom that she wasn't dead and her mother sounds more like a wise sage than a southern gal which is how she was described earlier.I in no way believe that the high council is stupid enough to not see what Neferette is doing. It dosen't make any sense at this point and makes them look nothing like the wise guardians that they are suppose to be. You can't have it both ways and just pretend that they don't see what's going on.And the dialog is still annoying as ever. I can not read any more of these.
