I tried, I really tried. At first, I thought oh well, seems like a nice book to get into, let yourself be carried in that little town through the story and the characters. I gave up this idea after some %s (Kindle) in the book.- the chapters were toooooo long and they had everyday dialogues of everyday stuff. Could be interesting, not when it is too much. You have your 14-20 characters and they talk to each other in various permutations along the book. Action, well, we know what happened through the talking to each other of the characters, or (worse) through the memories (written in italics, and that for pages and pages). This was a book which set no purpose, it could have gone forever - like the 80`s series (Dallas, Dynasty...). After reading quite accurately 30%, I started reading by skipping paragraphs (sic!) and I still got a sense of what is happening. And the only moment when there is something happening is in the last part. Still, this book could have last forever, until the characters die of too much talking to each other.There is again that american superficiality I see a lot in the contemporary books ("All the lights we cannot see", this one, "A little life"). Do this one got a Pulitzer based on the quantity of pages? There is just the story itself, life doesn't happen outside that town. There are only the town's dramas. And you have that on I think more than 500 pages.I thought a lot of "Stoner" when reading this book. Stoner vs Miles. Comparable characters, however that book I could read to the end. Probably because it was smaller and more concentrated. Here you have a soup with 14 or so characters, and none of them gets actually under your skin. And I have to blame the author, because it would have been potential fof Miles Ruby to be a memorable character. So it is not his fault, is Mr.Russo's fault.In the american literature nowadays is quite a lot about quantity - Yanighara was huge and in the end left the reader with nothing really, this one - same, 4321 - also huge. Anthony Doerr is also quite big.I dont know, a book must have a plot, something to keep the reader happy. I read a lot of reviews, talking about the "atmosphere of that town" - you cannot write a book to try to create atmosphere over more than 500 pages. Either you get that atmosphere from the beginning, or you don't.Sorry, Adriana, I would have liked to like the book. I chose my words here carefully, because it is one of your fav books from last year. But it didnt work for me at all.
