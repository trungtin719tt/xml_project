The premise of this book sounded so interesting - everyone over the age of 15 simplydisappearsone day and the remaining kids are left trying to figure out what happened... plus they discover that some of them are somehow developing supernatural powers. I was excited to read this and expected writing along the lines of Scott Westerfeld, based on the plot and such. But alas, the novel did not deliver for me and I put it down after 100 pages or so, when I found myself skimming pages and caring less and less.The problem, for me, was that the writing felt rather slow. I didn't get sucked into the story, nor did I feel the sense of urgency that the characters must have been feeling. Also, the narration skipping around from person to person, introducing new characters in new situations, and I didn't really care about most of them because I didn't know who they were or how they connected to the plot, and the "powers" that some of the characters developed didn't sound that exciting the way they were described. So, a disappointment.
