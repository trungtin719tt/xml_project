The Oprah phenomenon amazes me sometimes. Whatever she picks up and claims to be genius sells hundreds of millions of copies. Even if it is a patronizingly simple text like The Secret. I waited over a year after the first wave of zealous preaching about this book took over the nation to sit down and read it. At first I was a bit intrigued; honestly, it's "philosophy" is basic common sense: whatever energy you put out, you receive, good or bad. I've known that since I was a child. Think bad thoughts and you attract negative energy and vice versa. But the way The Secret delivers this idea is as if the author Rhonda Byrne is talking to a 4 year old. It is so simple and so crudely written that I found not in the least bit inspiring and, in fact, I found it to be one of the biggest money-making scams I've ever seen. There is very little actual text that Byrne has written herself; instead, she has filled the pages of the book with quotes from other people. Hundreds and hundreds of quotes that loosely back the statements she makes. I suppose I should say "good for her" for creating such an elaborate smoke screen that has made her millions of dollars. And perhaps, what is common sense to me, is a completely novel idea to mainstream America? True, the average Oprah-watching housewife in this country wasn't raised by a Taoist Tai Chi instructor and grew up reading Kerouac and Kant. Personally, I do know people whom have read this book and swear that it has changed their lives dramatically. Good for them! I'm always for positive thought and action. However, for this particular reader, The Secret was not the philosophical powerhouse that sensationalism has made it out to be. In fact, I would have to believe that the great philosophers of history are rolling over in their graves as we speak.Ah, Oprah! How can I get my book on your show? ;)
