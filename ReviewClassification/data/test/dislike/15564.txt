Poor prose, plot disjointed, internal logic flawed, no verisimilitude whatever. From a literary perspective, whether you're analyzing based on the idea that it's fiction or nonfiction. Most of it doesn't make sense. Worth reading because it's the basis of modern western civilization (along with the Torah, but I haven't read that), but also because you will find so much of it that has not been quoted that is just so...strange. So many things that one discovers that just do not add up, and I don't mean the part about adam and eve being the first people, then having two sons, one of whom (cain) goes off to marry the woman in the land of Nod (who is the child of...a chimp?)....but lots of other things, too.
