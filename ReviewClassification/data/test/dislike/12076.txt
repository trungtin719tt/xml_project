2.5 stars.I love Coelho's writing, and there are so many beautiful, inspiring quotes in this book. But as a whole? It was not that beautiful or inspiring. I can tell that that is what it's supposed to be, but it certainly fell a little short. The message behind this book was a good one, to embrace life and to live it as if our days were numbered, which they, in fact, are. But the problem with this book is that it is very, severely, un-relatable. People don't just casually stand there and give two-page-long speeches. The dialogues, though they are wonderfully-written, were unrealistic. The shifting of focus on characters was very confusing, like the book is written in 3rd person limited, but one paragraph we're focused on Veronika, then suddenly it's not about her, it's about Zelda. Then Dr. Igor. Then Mari. At parts, i did feel like it added a little more to the scene, to be able to tell what the other characters were thinking, but at other parts it was just unnecessary and uncalled for. What i also didn't like about this book was that, for the most part, there was no plot. Nothing was actually happening. This book is more character-based and that might appeal to some people, but it didn't work for me personally. The last 70 pages or so, from when Eduard shows up, the book started getting better and things started to pick up, but sadly, by which time i had lost interest. Suddenly, the book turned into a love story, which was also rather abrupt and unrealistic. However, i feel like the story would have been better if the main focus was on the love story and it had started, or hinted at, earlier on in the book. Veronika Decides to Die was not as good as i though it would be, but i did enjoy the last part.
