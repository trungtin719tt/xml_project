Waitare you telling me that the governmentcompletelyanticipated every last move and this was exactly what wasmeantto happen?Again?Between the all-knowing governments and coincidental memory loss, this book really lost my interest.Everything is so freaking convenient.The Maze Runnerwas intriguing.The Scorch Trialswent a little left-field.This one is so far out of the ballpark that we are in the next county or possibly country.The Main Pain: Character StupidityExample: Thomas and the rag-tag group fly from one part of the country to another to seek the TRUTH.The absolute worst part - they park their flying ship right outside of city gates AND use "fake" paperwork (with their real names) to get into the city.Then,they are completely flabbergastedwhen they are immediately tracked down by WICKED.They spend so much time wondering aloud how this could have happened.Could you imagine a more blazing trail?This behavior is not a one-off. The entire book is centered around acts and decisions like this.The OTHER Main Pain: "Love Triangle"Now, if you think the romance with Theresa was shoe-horned in - you are going to absolutely hate the Brenda one.There's so much competition for Thomas and I have yet to see a competent argument forwhyeither of them of them are interested.Thomas spends the whole book mooning over one and then the other - it didn't build tension, I just became apathetic.PICK ONE ALREADY.The OTHER, OTHER Main Pain: Missing MemoryEventually, Thomas gets the chance to finally figure everything out. FINALLY - the audience is going to get some answers for such an incredibly convoluted and precariously written novel.(view spoiler)[He decided he'd rather not know.AKA I waded through3 novelsonly for the main character to go, "ehhh, I'd rather keep everything shrouded in mystery.It felt like the author wrote himself into a corner and used Thomas's lame excuse to *not* have to fully answer the many (many) questions that arose throughout the book.(hide spoiler)]Irrepressible frustrationBlog|Instagram|Twitter
