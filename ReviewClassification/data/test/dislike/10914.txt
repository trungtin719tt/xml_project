Impressively hefty, but convinces me ultimately that Atwood has written much better books.An elderly woman remembers her life. The story flickers between present, past and pulp science fiction(view spoiler)[ bah! That's just everyday life, you are probably saying(hide spoiler)].She remembers: her lover, a hack writer of pulp science fiction and political radical. Her husband, an industrialist with dubious sexual tastes(view spoiler)[ ie illegal in many jurisdictions(hide spoiler)]and habits. Her sister, artistic but inarticulate. Her sister-in-law, a grand dame and prepared to defend her family reputation. Her father, WWI veteran, failed industrialist, troubled soul and suicide, his lover an artist. The mysterious book that scandalised society and has won fans to the present day that apparently her sister wrote.Their lives are intertwined. The atmosphere shifts from the free to the oppressive. The reader feels some pieces drop into place and searches for others. It is all very nicely done, one experiences unease and uncertainty, and says "a-ha" to oneself at the right moments, it has something of the feel of a fin de siecle painting to it, the symbolism at first obscure, then in a heartbeat, heavy handed and obvious. At the centre of the story I am reminded of lines fromKing Learhalf forgotten from school:Robes and furred gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold, And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks. I feel a good degree of regret at this book, as well as a certain sympathy towards it, it works very hard, it is skilful and clever, but the more it goes on , the more it reminds me that Atwood has impressed me more elsewhere. I am haunted by the central apex of childhood bullying inCat's eye, warmly amused by by the attempts to understand the crime inAlias Grace. This for me just wasn't visceral, perhaps it is too obvious from the structure that there will be a train crash and as one gets closer what will cause it, the extent of the fatalities and the lasting injuries of the survivors are too predictable? Of course you say, it is meant to be a tragedy.
