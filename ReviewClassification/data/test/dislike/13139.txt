I can't do it. I just can't.Screw this series.My problem with this series isn't the writing. I'm not one to judge books by the writing since I am pretty terrible at it myself. My problem also isn't exactly the story, which I probablycouldlike. Sort of. I think. I don't know. But anyways, mymainproblem isn't any of that.It's the characters.How can you continue with a series when you feel nothing but pure hatred towards the characters? They all just infuriated me to no end. Jace Wayland especially. He was nothing but a painfully arrogant jackass.I tried to give this series a chance, but that was pretty much the last straw. I simply will not continue on with it, and guess what?
