I did not care for this book--at all. I thought it had too many plots, scene interruptions and not enough romance. I was very disappointed in Phury's character--FIVE months and he all but ignored Cormia, then "assigned" John Mathews to show her around.Did not think Phury's way or style of killing "lessers" should have been grounds for kicking him out of the Brotherhood. It wasn't just the drug problem because he'd had that for several hundred years. The icing on the cake was his torturing the "lessers" coupled with his carelessness. Yes, he was a hazard to have watching your back, but he did his killings alone.Phury's reasons for being a drug addict and vow of celibacy didn't tally up for me. He was whining about his childhood, when it wasn't that bad, certainly not enough to warrant several hundred years of drugs, celibacy, and guilt. I did not care for his internal wizard or his drug addiction and felt the Brother's should have undertaken prevention long ago. He was known as a liar and they believed he would be the Primale? They knew he was prone to dishonesty and they knew he was celibate.For me, Wrath really lacked in leadership in the past couple of books. He should have been more aware what was going on in Quinn's life and how he was being treated by his family. He should be more aware of what the Brother's are doing as well.As for Quinn's story, I fail to see how the race can be so desperate for "young" and treat one as an outcast because he has two different colored eyes. No wonder they are faced with possible extinction. Between the asinine rules on The Other Side and Glymera coupled with "lessers" killing them, their ability to remain a solvent race is slim. Toss in the added Brother's are practically falling apart and what a mess.I did not care for all the details on Quinn, John Mathew, Blay. Their "coming of age" scenes and internal drama's were too much for me. I didn't need to know about their bodies baser urges to such detail and frequency. I got it the first time! Talk about throwing a wrench in the mess--Blay.I did not care for Rhevenge or Xhex's stories. My WTF meter was at its maximum toleration level when their tales unfurled. (eyes rolling)For me, the ending was the best part, but because there was very little interaction between Phury and Cormia, just didn't add up to a great "I love you."Finally, there were a lot of mundane details throughout the book that I thought dragged the story lineS down. I got the impression this book was rushed and not as well edited as past books. I realize all the Brother's have now had their turn at the wheel and this one allowed for the story line to continue--albeit in a slightly more sci-fi/urban fantasy genre and not necessarily romance.
