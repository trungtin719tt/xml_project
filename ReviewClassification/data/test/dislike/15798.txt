I shot heroin for a decade, and at the time, I had this wrongful solidarity towards the culture and arts that surrounded it.My first exposure to Burroughs was the novel Junky - a trashy pulp book with a thin plot. Even at 19, a period when starring at my tennis shoes for multiple hours at a time entertained me, I found no enjoyment from this man's prose.Fast forward about 6 years, I'm in the middle of a long federal prison stretch, my literary receptors have become more pronounced. I'm getting through long-winded books like Infinite Jest, War and Peace, etc.And still interested in drug literature, although not finding much with any artistic merit.I like some of the Beat literature, Kerouac's On the Road and Big Sur were enjoyable. I've always been told that Burroughs was the most influential, seminal, and avant-guard of the mix.I read Naked Lunch and detested it for many reasons, namely the fragmentary style, which I know was from the cut-up thing. There was some genius writing but it was much too few and far between.I'm heterosexual and didn't like the pornographic gay imagery sprinkled between the drug stuff. I can handle this kind of content if it functions correctly in a work, Hubert Selby jr. comes to mind.But when you have some nauseating non-linear incoherency and then throw in these graphic and pointless sex scenes, it makes you feel nothing.If a work of art is just shock value, if the only emotion it can evoke is confusion, then the writer has accomplished nothing; just an esoteric puzzle, people can falsely intellectualize to try and sound sophisticated to other people.I read this in a prison cell. I had no distractions, I tried to interpret it a million different ways and have only come to one understanding: this is like a bad homosexual acid trip, if you are into bad homosexual acid trips that don't make sense, you should definitely check it out.
