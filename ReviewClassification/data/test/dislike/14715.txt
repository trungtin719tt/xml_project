So, I really wanted to like this word parking lot. I wanted to serve it a plate of you-the-bomb. Hitting the rewind button on RL, the beginning of this book had me palming the snooze button. There was a whole lot of wake me when this junk gets good going on. What's doing, JR? What? You know us fans love some action, true? Blasting some Jay-Z rhymes in the background, I sucked it up and read the dang thang. And wouldn't you know, it started to get good on me? I was feeling some this-book-is-kinda-growing-on-me-for reals. I think this book released a bonding scent on me, you feel me? I couldn't put it down after the sun ducked for cover.Maybe because it was psycho Lash, I even paid attention to what's doing with the Lessers. He must have 70% control in crazy stock because I busted out with giggles when he left that message on V's machine. Funniest. Villain. Ever.What had my eyebrows rubbing my hairline was the change in Xhex. She wasn't that likable before. I won't front, if I knew I could beat her in a fist fight, I would have written it in one of my previous reviews, but her being an assassin and all had me going all Kindergarten with the zipper on my mouth. But trauma will change you and Xhex had her cake and all, and wouldn't you know, I started to like the Sympath. Great, now I feel like a Nancy or something. John was still adorable. He stuck by his woman like white on rice, even when she was going all Atkins Diet on his feelings. They were so romantic in a we're-both-killers kind of way. And ain't that something to write home about.I missed the Brothers in this one. Whenever one of them felt like putting in an appearance in the books' real estate, I felt myself grinning so hard the sides of my mouth caressed my ears, you feel me? Seriously some Mary Poppins type love going on here.And wouldn't you know, at first reading about Thor and Darrius was a bore. I won't front, I skimmed those sections like milk. But it started to get interesting so I had to go all Back to the Future Part III on those parts.Say whatever you want, I wasn't feeling the whole Blay/Qhuinn/Saxton thing. It almost seemed forced. But almost as much as I love extra sharp cheddar cheese, I love Blay, Quinn, and Saxton. And just like you do with someone you love, I tapped the ignore switch on the cheesiness of their storyline. And cheese it was. Extra. Sharp. Cheddar. Yum, yet still cheese. Ya heard?And wouldn't you know, JR. Used. These. Four. thiiinnnnngggsss a buttloooooooaddd of tiimmmeesss throughout-the-book. Oh and I SO don't want to forget how much she SO used that word. But like a Nancy, I still liked everything and served it with a side of 3.5 stars. Like the good ship Titanic, I was doomed from the second time I picked up one of her books. My second time sealed the deal. And like one of Rhev's old customers I'll buy the next book she puts out. Addiction, much?--------------Upon further reflection I didn't like this book as much as I thought. I missed the brothers. I liked writing the review though, so that's something, right? 2 stars!
