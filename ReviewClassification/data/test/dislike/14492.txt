I read it because I can't watch a movie without reading the book, first. What I want to know is, HOW this man got so popular? He can't write for crap. Utterly unbelievable. First of all, we have Elizabeth, who is a single mom who is a teacher (think lesson plans, grading papers, gone all day, etc) who takes her son to chess/baseball/violin, who also cares for her grandmother (who had a stroke), AND co-runs a kennel/obedience school out of her home AND is carting her son back and fort to visitation... and on top of ALL of that, cans her own home-grown salsa. In. What. Time? Let's be a little realistic, shall we? Yet every time we see her in the book, she's just hanging out on the porch. Yeah. Right.Then there's Logan, who only exists in someone's imagination. A man who is that perfect does not live. He's a pianist. A violinist. Has a degree in Anthropology. Fixes cars. Trains animals. Is a war hero. Survived ELEVEN bombings in Iraq. Plays chess, makes kites out of garbage bags and straws like MacGuyver, is a prolific reader, WALKED from Colorado to North Carolina, has a bottomless wallet of cash only... it's just crazy.Then there's fun little stupid things like when Nicholas Sparks has Elizabeth planting thousands of tulips and daffodils every spring, so they can come up after the azaleas. Um... tulips and daffodils are PERENNIALS... they come up every year, you don't have to re-plant, Nick... and tulips are the FIRST things that come up, along with crocus and daffodils. The man drives me crazy.And I'm not even sure I want to see the movie. The book says Logan got a degree in anthropology, has done three tours of duty as a Marine in Iraq, has 'wild' hair and a vagabond appearance and "doesn't look like a college student"... and they cast Zac Ephron? You have GOT to be kidding me.And yet all of his books become movies. I don't get it.
