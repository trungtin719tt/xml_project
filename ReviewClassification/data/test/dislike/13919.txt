I was intrigued to learn that Frost andEdward Thomashad met and spent time together in England before the first world war following on from a review of some of Frost's poetry by Thomas. I feel both that in some way that the two of these people are now coming together in my understanding is a sign both of the deficiencies in my education and that luckily there is ever more to discover about the world. I believe"The Road not taken"was inspired by some of the walks the two went on and that Frost encouraged Thomas to write and publish his own poetry too. There is something unnerving about that connection for me, perhaps just the sense of how long Frost's adult life was since he was also performing at the inauguration(view spoiler)[ there's a lovely Roman word carrying the ideology of an alien world into modern times(hide spoiler)]of J.F. Kennedy.I recall a verse about almost being carried off by an eagle as a child which has then that reoccurring theme in poetry of the writer's self identity as poet, but also their own place in their culture. Frost not becoming Ganymede stands in relation to Petrarch and his Laura evoking the laurel which crowns the poet's brow as symbol of the Muse's victory.Although the volume, no doubt cheaply acquired, stands on the shelf I doubt I'll become deeply acquainted with it. Poetry for me has the feel of hard work to it, I am a lazy reader, disinclined to break my head over ambiguous phrasing and elusive meaning.
