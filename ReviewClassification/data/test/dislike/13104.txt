What anannoyingbook.I was going to write snarky, individual letters to each of the characters in succession, but then I realized that it was a pointless endeveaour since all the letters would end up the same, anyway. Why, you ask? Because all the characters are the same.Would you like to know some personality traits? It's like the author picked one or two for each of the characters and then relied on either one or the other to simply parasail each of the girls through the book.There was Lena, who was beautiful and shy. But we all know that shy girls have a bevy of passion hidden up inside, right?There was Bridget, who was a flirtatious athelete. Her plotline involves flirting with a guy, I don't know, ten years older than her? More?There was Carmen, who was either angry or passive through the book and is the least interesting character in the whole series. I'm glad, however, for this. In the second book she morphs into a semi-interesting absolutebrat.And then there was Tibby. Thank goodness for Tibby. She was absolutely the only character with a personality or an interesting story in the whole book. Tibby, get better friends. Or none at all. Considering Tibby, she'd probably go withnone at all.In fact, the only storyline I enjoyed was Tibby and Bailey's, and I found myself flipping through Carmen's, Lena's and Bridget's chapters to get to hers.Although I did stop at Bridget's a couple of times to see if she actually did hook up with Mr. Coach Man. Which is illegal, since she's 16 and he's... uh. 26?And here we get to what bothered me. Why didn't someone arrest Eric? And why are Bridget's friends so irresponsible? When Bridget basically tells them that she slept with a guy over 18, the only reaction she gets are some wide eyes. Don't you want to, you know,report the rapist to the police?Oh, I know it was Bridget's choice, and all that. And I would semi-understand if he was an interesting character or she was an interesting character and they had semi-interesting chemistry together. But they didn't. They had mutual attraction based on mutual sexiness, and didn't really bother to get to know each other much more, even in the next three books. Not that there's anything to know.Dull. Dull, dull, dull. If it had been a novella featuring only Tibby, I might have found it a lot better, maybe even given it four stars. But with the rest of thebaggagecharacters tagging along for the ride... no, thanks.
