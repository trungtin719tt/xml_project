Could not finish.This was my second try at reading a Tom Clancy and this was even more disappointing than the first. I suppose if I was an American and this was the height of the cold war, I might think differently but it's not the 80s and I am English, so too bad. This read like a propaganda novel, describing the Soviets as backwards and unreliable, belittling the 'Brits', and always emphasising American superiority. I won't deny it started off well, but then it got dull and i spent a lot of time just waiting for something to happen, and when something did happen, Clancy revealed it two pages before.If you're considering reading this, just watch the movie.
