This book is all over the place! At the very least it should have been published as two different novels - I don't really see much of a connection between the first half and the second half. Completely different characters and tone. The first half was too violent for me, but the second half wasn't too bad. For some reason I kept getting the feeling that we weren't getting the WHOLE truth about Jesus though...hmmm, perhaps some chapters were edited out by the publishers?
