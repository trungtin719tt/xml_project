after all the raving of my friends over coelho (and especially the alchemist....), i chose to read this one in portuguese, and the only thing i liked about it is its extremely simple style as i could read it without ever touching a dictionary in a language i don't know well - still, i don't know if that's a compliment for the author:-)the story of maria, the brazilian prostitute in switzerland, left me completely cold. as others remarked here, her philosophical ramblings were not only boring, but also completely out of character.coelho is a really clever businessman: he uses all the esoteric crap of the seventies and sells it as something new, and in this book he adds a good dose of sex to make it sell even better.....last book of him i'm going to buy, maybe i'll give the alchemist a try out of pure curiosity, but i'll definitely just borrow it from someone....
