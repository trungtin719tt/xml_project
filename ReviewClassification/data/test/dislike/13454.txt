** 2"Forgive me Father for I am dumb" STARS**Okay, I know I said I wasn't going to write a review, but God *beep* it, this book left me confused, defeated &amp; feeling like a royal idiot. I couldn't wait for Carla to finish because she had some splanin to do. Um yeah, that conversation went something like this . .. . . Yup, neither one of us understood the ending. We went from riding the short bus, to pushing it.There are two main plot points that didn't add up &amp; it's driving me crazy. Please do not peek inside if you plan to read the book .(view spoiler)[1) Can someone please explain the purpose of the gargoyles statues?Per the three kings, the penance for her sins was the following:"You shall be returned to the world, and your chest shall be filled anew with thousands of hearts.You must give each away, until all are gone but one.". . . Cool, I understand the rules but that's not what happened.A) Marianne sold the Gargoyles, she did not give them away.B) When she went for a "swim" there were numerous unclaimed gargoyles/grotesques.2) Did he believe Marianne Engel was his long lost love or that she was schizophrenic?He who shall apparently remain nameless thought the following;(@97%)" It never takes me long to start lying again, trying to convince myself that Marianne Engel's imaginary past was legitimate simply because she believed it so deeply. Everyone's past, I try to rationalize , is nothing more than the collection of memories they choose to remember. But in my heart, I know this is just a defense mechanism that I manufacture simply so I can go on living with myself. ".. .Thank the Lort, he and I are in agreement, Marianne Engel's indeed coo-coo for coocoa puffs.**DUN-DUN-DUUUUN!!!**Not so fast, Bucko! A few pages later Mc Nameless thinks the following;(@99%)" This will mark the third time that an arrow has entered my chest. The first time brought me to Marianne Engle. The second time separated us. The third will reunite us". . . Pleasssssse, someone set my dumb ass straight. I need answers. I'd like some closure . .(hide spoiler)]Now this is the part which I try to avoid, but its rare for me to give a book two stars. I feel as though I should explain my rating.. . . I know, I know, this whine fest isn't needed. . . . but I'm adding it anyway. Please remember I'm a smart-ass &amp; do not wish to berate the author in any way. Any and all jokes are directed towards his characters or myself.... In fact, feel free to bypass this section entirely.Okay, here goes:*It irked me that I was never told either MC name. Although I read MarianneEngela thousand times, it turns out that wasn't her birth name. It really isn't a big deal, but why add that tidbit in the first place? If it was to prove she was crazy, I was already a believer. But what about "He who shall remain nameless"? &lt;-- Hmm, was he a fallen angel?* I did not feel the love connection (at all) it felt more like a mother-son relationship, than a epic love story. Where was the intimacy? Yes, I'm aware that "what's his face" no longer had a penis, but I've walked into a room where a couple was simply looking at each other &amp; it felt like I just walked in on them having sex, that's the intimacy I'm referring to. Where was the affection? She could have held his good hand. They could have kissed. There was no wanting to be near this person nor words of missing the others touch. The author had numerous opportunities to showcase their fondness for one another. Maybe they did and I just didn't feel it.* Their/ Her love spanned over 700 years. What was she doing the 600+ years they were apart? Why didn't she find him sooner?* I'm still trying to figure out how his penis was incinerated but his balls went unharmed. Did he tuck them inside his asshole? This poor character was left with no frank, just beans. I keep thinking it symbolizes something, but what ? I have no idea.*What happened to him being suicidal? He went from having this elaborate plan to it never being brought up again, in the blink of an eye.*I completely loved the beginning of the story. I know some readers found the details of his injuries to be overly graphic, but I was lapping them up likes drinks at happy hour. I couldn't put this book down. Then Marianne Engel entered the picture .... . . I'm sure this is where I'm going to agree to disagree with others but I did not like Marianne Engel. At times I found her to be annoying, self-centered(view spoiler)[ -(ex) staying downstairs for days at a time without checking on the love of her life or her dog. Did she ask him any questions about himself? Did she ever give him an option on, well anything? Story time was always at her convenience. Hello, he should have been asking Marianne Engel to tell him more about their story. The timing of her confrontation regarding his morphine addiction sure felt like it happened when it best suited her. Why didn't she confront him immediately?(hide spoiler)]as well as pushy.(view spoiler)[like when Marianne Engel took him to the scene of his accident without any warning. That's a traumatic experience, the person needs to be mentally prepared. .I also didn't approve of her actions at the coffee shop. She should ask him if she could call the little boy over, instead she put him .. as well as the boys mother in a awkward position. Out of the three adults , Marianne Engel was the one person who should have kept their lip zipped. Just sayin. And while we're on the subject of being talkative, I've never wanted to duct tape a heroine'sfacemouth more than I did, Marianne Engel. She never SHUT UP.(hide spoiler)]* Why the four other stories?Granted they were entertaining, but IMHO they weren't needed as they took away from the past &amp; present story line.* I found his injuries to be inconsistent. One second I'm reading about his urine bag &amp; the next, he's seating down on a toilet to pee. Also, per the description of his groin area, there's no hole. Mr. Incognito bumped into a car &amp; was in such excruciating pain, he needed a shot of morphine, yet at the Halloween party he was crawling all over the floor like a baby, without so much as an ouch. Also, he had one good ear, so why did a plastic surgeon offer to rebuild both?* This book was Grand Filler Station. As some of you are already aware, unnecessary information is a HUGE pet peeve of mine. There were pages (plural) of food listed. We were given word meanings that would've impressed Mr.Webster himself. I read an entire (untranslated) conversation written in Japanese. Granted the author did elaborate later on, but he could have easily stated,the two characters were having a discussion in a foreign language.*Parts of the story were so religiously detailed, I told Carla that I think the publisher made a mistake. I went from reading a fictional story to studying a theology text book. Hell, I grabbed a pen &amp; paper and started taking notes just in case there was a pop quiz at the end of the book. Not that it was necessarily a bad thing, I just felt it took away from the main story.. . I could say more but I think I've said my peace ... and then some :-) Please don't allow my review to deter you from readingThe Gargoyle. There are thousands of five star reviews. This book just didn't work for me but it may very well save your soul.
