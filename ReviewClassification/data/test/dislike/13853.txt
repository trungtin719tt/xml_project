This book is chock-full of bad prose, flat characters, and very unfortunate implications. Every Jewish character is brave, strong, smart, and talented. The Arabs, on the other hand, are all cowardly, stupid, and possessive of women (with one exception, but he dies early on.)The founding of Israel was controversial, and you would think that an author writing about it would address the moral ambiguity. Leon Uris doesn't even try. He turns a complex, multi-sided historical event into a cliched battle between "good" and "evil."This book frightened me. There was one scene where a boy was inducted into an extremist Zionist organization. The ritual involved placing one hand on a Bible and the other on a gun. While the other characters didn't agree with the extremism at first, they later conceded that this organization had the right idea.I'm Israeli, and I could hardly stomach this book. It scares me that so many people think it's a wonderful work of literature.
