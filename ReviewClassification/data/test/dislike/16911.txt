A newly transferred student, Bianca Olivier, doesn't want to be in Evernight Academy. She feels like an outcast and finds other students brilliant, competitive and intimidating. When she tries to escape, a mysterious and attractive guy, Lucas Ross, stumbled her way. They easily get along with each other but he warned her not to get close with him. Despite his warnings, she's drawn to him and nothing can stop her for being with him. As their secrets unfold, the connection between them might set apart and loyalties are going to be tested.Unfortunately, I didn't like this book. I wasn't hooked with the story and the heroine is very annoying. Bianca is an immature, reckless, clingy and whiny heroine. I can't stand her obsession on Lucas as she keeps talking about him. I think she needs to more important things than love life. Most of the characters in this book are bland except Balthazar More. I'll give this series a chance and pick up the sequel when I'm in the mood. Crossing my fingers there will be an improvement.
