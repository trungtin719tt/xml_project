All of the plotlessness and pointlessness ofOne Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fishbut none of the wild creativity or language play.I mean, I know an easy reader needs to have simple language, but there are tons of books that manage that without being this insipid.And why oh why does the female dog have to win the approval of the male dog by changing her hat, until they ride off into the sunset at the end when he finally likes her hat?I could go on. I wouldn't even bother to comment on this, except it's a "classic" and that scares me.
