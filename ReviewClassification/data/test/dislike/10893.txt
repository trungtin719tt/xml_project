It was bound to happen at some point in my reading aloud to my wife that I would finish a book and we would let out a collective groan. I just wish it had been on something less than 670 pages.I began to stitch together a longish review pinpointing all of the things that didn't work in this book, but I decided that since 2014 hasn't yielded me much precious reading time so far, I'd much prefer to spend free hours lost in another book and not thinking any further on this one. I've not read anything by Peter Straub, so perhaps all of the really bad parts I can attribute to him.A last thought: does Stephen King have any black friends? If so, I hope they ask him over a ham sandwich what the deal is with the recurring Magical Negro trope that appears in every novel I've read of his so far. Annoying.
