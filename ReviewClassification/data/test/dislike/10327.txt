This book was the final straw for me. I wanted to love this whole series as I loved book one, but it has gotten progressively worse with every book, in my humble opinion. Ms. Gabaldon's editors should be taking a much closer look at the arc, plot, and character development for inconsistency and redundancy. The first book was amazing, though the ending was very difficult to swallow. The second was very good, compelling but heartbreaking. The third starts to teeter on unnecessarily verbose with a wandering plot where characters tend to do things out of character. However, it still had merit as an overall work. This one was disappointing on so many levels. Ms. Gabaldon drags on for pages at a time about absolutely nothing that pertains to the plot--bee hives, sunsets, the various shades of red of Jamie's hair, you name it. I realize many readers enjoy this in historicals, and while I enjoy beautiful imagery, I'd rather it not take over the entire plot. Pacing was WAY off for me here.Also, the characters do several heinous things that are completely out-of-character from how the author originally wrote them. At least, that's how it appeared to me. It is as if the characters switched places with people I've never met before. So much so that Ms. Gabaldon has permanently scarred me from ever wanting to read one more word about their lives--good or bad. I just don't care anymore. All three main characters do ridiculous things which results in a forced plot. I was so disappointed with this book that I only skim/skipped to the end from the middle on just to finish it for closure. Ms. Gabaldon is an excellent writer, there is no mistaking that. However, for me, there should be more than eloquent imagery and sexy lovemaking to keep me on the hook.
