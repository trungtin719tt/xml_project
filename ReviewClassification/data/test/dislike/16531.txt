Giving a Stephen King book 2 stars pains me a lot, but I can't bump it up to 3 stars just because he's my favorite author. This book was awful, and 500 pages longer than it should've been.I get everyone's opinion that we need that backstory of Roland, but in my opinion, King could've just considered this a novella. Something that could be read if the reader wanted to. He made this the fourth novel, so that means the readers are obliged to read this if they want to continue on with the series. Honestly this actually felt like a novella, a really bad one, at least for me.The beginning of this novel was amazing. It was a continuation of the riddle contest they were having with the villain. After the contest though, the backstory started. The backstory was terribly boring. I didn't care about anyone, not even Susan. It was about 500 pages of rambling on about his past and love for Susan. Like I said, King could've just made that into a novella. This is the first time that I just browsed through 500 pages. It was so boring I almost took a break from reading the book. I'll be honest and say I'll most probably forget everything in that 500 pages as soon as I'm finish writing this review.I heard that the next 3 novels are a huge improvement, so that's a terrific thing to hear. Despite the abomination known as book 4, I'm still very much interested to continue on with the series.1.5/5 stars. Too much backstory and romance. I was not interested at all, but in a few years I might reread this. I'll see what I think about Roland and Susan's relationship then.
