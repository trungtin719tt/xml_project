I LIKED this book. Truth is I read the second book first and then I read the third one and this one.None of the stories in this book are great like L.J Smith's other books.In 'Secret Vampire' I liked the plot line but I didn't find James to have much depth and I didn't find him very belivable.Everything else was good but I wish I had gotten a little more from Cliff, the stepdad.Even so this was my favorite story in this book. In 'Daughters of Darkness' not only did every single character seem fake but the plot seemed forced and I couldn't understand a thing.You would think that with such a horrible beginning and middle that the author would put a litttle something in the end. Nope, no such luck,The love interest goes away to'redeem himself' and the she's just watching him leave. Excuse moi? Did I miss something? Anywho, onto 'Spellbinder' I had no real problems with this book it was good but just good.I keep re-reading too see if maybe there were some key points I missed that really gave the stories an oomph. Tough luck.
