I picked this book out of my advisory grab bag and it's thickness made me a little nervous about having to tackle such a large book in a week in a half. But my hope leaped forward when a realized that this book was written in, yessss, poetry! Well I really wouldn't call them "poems" more like paragraphs with weird spacing, but those weird spaces created lots of blank space and a lot less words. Other than the shortening factor of the poetic layout, I really would have preferred a normal book. It was really annoying when the poems is written all on the left side of the page except the final word.It made my head hurt. And even worse were the poems written so that it had seemingly random spaces and no order once so ever. I understand there must be a reason behind this but is this really necessary?No. It's not. No one wants to take the time to figure out how the heck to read this, but you're forcing them to. Yea yea "it symbolizes the disorganization of her life after doing meth blahblahblah" yea well I'm NOT doing meth and annoyingly spacing the words out is not going to entertain me, it's just not.On to the plot!Well I don't really think I am the preferred audience, teenage girl in New York, okay yea maybe I am. But it didn't surprise me all to much. Anyone who has seen a drug rehab lifetime movie presents could have guessed the story. Oh no! She'll do drugs! Oh no! But wait! Someone gets raped! Oh no! She'll have sex! And guess what else? YES! She's preggers! Oh my goodness! and if THAT wasn't enough drama for ya! THE RAPIST IS THE FATHER!I'm sure there are A LOT of people who will eat this secret life of teenagers drama right up like an apple pie. But I'm not one of those people. If you liked "Go Ask Alice" this is the book for you. If you didn't like it or even just didn't bother to read it, like yours truly, this is not the book for you.I guess it was just bad luck at a grab bag.
