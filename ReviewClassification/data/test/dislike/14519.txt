Ug. I bought these quite a while back. The Vampire Diaries tv show was just starting up and I wanted to give the books a shot. I saw the omnibus of the first three of these books by the same author at the grocery store one day and picked them up to try. The premise sounded interesting. I stuck it on the shelf and didn't think about it for quite a while. I read the first two Vampire Diaries books and they sucked hard. I wouldn't have tried these except I already owned them. And after the first, I wouldn't have read the next two, but they were in the same book. And they're quick reads. These stories are just awful. They're full of stupid teenagers that have no clue about anything. They're even dumber than most teenagers, making snap decisions that will effect the rest of their lives. Sometimes turning from intense hatred of a person to true love always in the plan of a minute. They're just awful. I don't recommend that anyone reads these. Please. Just don't.
