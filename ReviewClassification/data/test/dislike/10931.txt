Krauss calls this book the history of love but it struck me as being more a history of loss. It is the story of a displaced person, an elderly man drowning in urban isolation, cut off from his only son and deprived even of authorship of his own words. He is a man who fears that he is invisible and whose only friend is in fact imaginary. Krauss has created an unforgettable character in Leo Gursky. I could have done without some of the smoke and mirrors she felt she needed to create around Leo's story but I am very glad to have read it.
