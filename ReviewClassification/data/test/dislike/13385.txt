Disappointing.Having read and loved Graceling, I was greatly anticipating Fire and was unfortunately very let down. Fire never gripped me, I never came to care about her, or even like her much.There are a lot of things about this book that bothered me. The character of Archer, the friend with benefits, seems out of place in a YA novel. There was an awful lot of casual sex and making babies and confused parentage.And, seriously, she has to walk around with an armed guard because she's having her period? All of that info went nowhere, it didn't add to the story and wasn't neccessary to the plot.Fire's relationship with Brigan didn't ring true. It didn't have anything to base it on other than he was kind to her and she couldn't get in his head. Where have I read that before?I didn't quite understand the whole monster world. Where did they come from?There wasn't any real tension to the book, nothing she was striving toward or away from, it all just sort of sits there, nothing really memorable about the whole story. It seems like a lot of lead up to nothing.The whole plot with the archers coming after her and Leck kidnapping her fizzled.I can't even recommend this one to fans of Graceling, sorry to say.
