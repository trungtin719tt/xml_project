My aunt gave this to me to read..I of course hate Dan Brown but I figure it'd be fast and I could thank her for it, mention some interesting tidbits that are no doubt sprinkled throughout the book for idiots, and feel good about family duty. There is not one paragraph that is close to some acceptable literary decency. In 2 pages he found it ok to mention coffee 5 times. No, not fun tidbits about the history of coffee but just as action filler: 'blah blah blah,' he said while he stirred his coffee. Multiply that by 5 (some instance of someone using, gasp, cream, or sugar) and 2 minutes have been sucked from your life. And you will feel it. Unless you're an idiot.I admit I stopped at page 140. It was a marathon of elementary torture. I started it one night and ended it the same. I didn't read 140 pages because I was thrilled, I read it because it took that long for Dan Brown to get to the premise of the effing book. And that isn't even that interesting. Enjoy, idiots.
