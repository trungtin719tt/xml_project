Throughout the books, reading in Elena's narration, only one thought stood out in my mind. It's this:'Oh my God, she's such a shallow, snobby, self-absorbed bitch.'I hate Elena. My gosh, I can't stand her. Sure, she's become more. . . decent as the series progress but I still can't find it in my heart to like her. I can't evenrelateto her, to start with.She's manipulative. She uses her friends to get what she wants. What's even more frustrating is that this one friend of hersknowsit but still lets her use him like some puppet he is. (I forgot his name. Didn't bother to remember).I would have liked this series better if Elena wasn't so obnoxious and unbearable. L.J.Smith's beautiful atmospheric writing style never once wavered but the characterisation she decided to make in Elena is truly and well disappointing.I can't say much about the romance between her and Stefan. It is like there isn't enough fire to it. No special chemistry between them. They kinda burn for each other as the story progresses but I don't find myself rooting for them. I don't understand why Elena was so obsessed with Stefan just because he ignores her.Damon may be dark, mysterious and sexy but seriously, his stalkerish nature creeps me off.The storyline is still *pretty* good though. I definitely didn't see the huge turn of tables coming at the end of the whole series.
