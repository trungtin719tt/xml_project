Only made it to page 180, but someday I'll finish it. In the meantime, some paintings of a few myths I did read:John William Waterhouse,Echo and Narcissus, in which Echo (who can only echo what other people say) fails to save Narcissus from drowning himself while admiring his own wonderful visage.Francisco de Goya,Saturn Devouring His Son, in which the titan Saturn eats all his children so that they won't be the death of him.Peter Paul Rubens,Leda and the Swan, in which a woman is raped by Zeus in the form of a swan.Amphora depicting Odysseus and his men blinding the Cyclopean Polyphemus, c. 660 BCE.
