OH MY GOD THIS BOOK WAS SO BORING.I also felt like the world and all of the powers weren't explained very well, and you're constantly in the dark! It's ok to leave some things unanswered until later, but basic things should be explained early on, and I didn't feel like they were in this book.Highly disappointing.
