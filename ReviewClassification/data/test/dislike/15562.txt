I felt this book had a very scattered perspective. Almost as if there were several different authors. The editing could have been better in order to eliminate the dry spots. (Begat, begat, begat, etc.... Boooooring.) Solomon's Song.... ??? What the heck was that all about. Also there were several highly unlikely characters. People living 900 Years?? 9 foot tall giants?? I'm dead, wait I'm not?? It's MY baby, no it's MY baby. Moms... wouldn't you know your baby? It is a little disconcerting you must admit. 50/50 then...??? Hmmm... it will be interesting to get a definitive interpretation to the cryptic almost phsycotic babblings at the end. And was it 7 seals.... or 7 sea lions? Anyway... still trying to figure it all out.
