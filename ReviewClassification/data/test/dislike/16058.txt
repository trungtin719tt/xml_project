Starting with the positive points, they had really interesting vampires. The idea of older generations of vampires being reincarnated into future generations sounded pretty cool. They don't really die, they come back in the future generations as someone else with the same soul. I thought that was pretty well thought-out.Now it's time for the negative points. And boy, did I have many. First, the writing. I was getting sick of all those detailed descriptions about clothing and what designer brand they are. I don't give a fuck if they were from Gucci or whatever. That shit doesn't matter in vampire novels. I do give kudos, however, that they did mention two of my favorite bands though (Muse and The Strokes).The main character "Schuyler" was as deep as a brick. Her lack of personality made me bored blue with this book. But of course, she's as pretty as hell, so her zero personality doesn't have to matter at all. And oh yeah, she's had a tragic past (parents died, whatdiayaknow?)This seems to be a fault in many vampire novels. The female protagonist always has to be beautiful with shitty character qualities. How about making them actually believable? Fucking Mary-Sues everywhere.The rest of the characters were shallow assholes. Some of them were OKAY, but the vampire ones were bland and not in the least bit as vampiric as they were supposedly. Those vampires are all rich, so what does it matter if they're a bunch of reincarnated snobs?I might pick up the second novel, but to be quite honest, I don't really care what happens to all of them. They can all get staked and die. :)
