Based on true life, this is a story about the author's experiences of addiction and then recovery in rehab.First of all it was marketed as a memoir, secondly, following a debacle with Oprah Winfrey, the author confessed that it was largely altered and padded out to make him look more macho. The levels of machismo described were ridiculous and irritating....eg he talks about having root canal treatment at the dentist without any anaesthetic. Just powering on through it as only a real butch toughie can do. Throughout the book he is strong, silent and tough - handling horrible experiences of detoxing and physical side-effects, with great stoicism. To me it appeared that he was boasting about his manliness, and as I already said, I found it irritating. He also describes a love affair he had in rehab, (intense and smouldering, as befits a real hunk of man.)(view spoiler)[ It had a tragic ending(hide spoiler)]- but research has shown it was unlikely that this woman ever existed.The one point of interest for me was that the rehab where he went was supposed to be the best in America, and it kept pushing, pushing, pushing him to do the 12 Step Alcoholic Anonymous programme. He was told flatly that he would fail unless he did the twelve steps, plus there were no alternative programmes on offer. As it was he dug his heels in and totally refused to take part in AA exercises. He attended compulsory lectures, but that was it. He just used the general ambiance of rehab, and the support of staff and fellow inmates, in order to recover. But recover he did.... That much is true.So, this book started out as a memoir, but is now known to be generously fleshed out with fiction.I thought it was gripping when I read it, but when I learnt it wasn't a straight autobiography I felt cheated. I now wish I hadn't bothered to read it. I wanted to learn about a real experience, not a highly glossed up version of what happened.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~The Wikipedia article describing the issues about the book:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Milli...
