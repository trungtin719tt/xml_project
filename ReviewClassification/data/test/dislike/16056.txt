What the actual hell did I just read?Okay, I'll admit, I picked this up in the first place because it sounded vaguely likeGossip Girl, which is a guilty pleasure of mine. It also sounded vaguely likeTwilight, which I wouldn't really call a guilty pleasure, but I will admit that there was a lot of entertainment value there.I feel like I just went to a distant relative's house for dinner, and I'm not sure what exactly happened in the kitchen and I'm a little afraid to ask, but I have to be polite and eat it anyway. I wasn't forced to read this book, but I felt compelled to read it because damn it, I was on a waiting list for this crap.There was not one character I didn't want to punch in the face at some point. At the end of the book I only halfway found myself liking Bliss (actual name. What the hell kind of name is Bliss??) and kind of hoping that the rest would be run over by a giant tank of Silver Bloods. I hated how contrived their snobbery felt and I hated the creepy twincest references through the whole book.Yet I STILL FREAKING READ IT. I think I was holding out hope, because there was a lot of potential here. These kids in some ritzy private school are vampires, but they don't know they're vampires. They all happen to be high society, ruling their little ritzy school and their shops and their nightclubs. But not only are they vampires, they're also angels. ANGELS. This guy close to the end (withholding name to avoid spoilers) apparently has some tattoo that means he is Michael. MICHAEL THE ARCHANGEL DEFEND US IN BATTLE Michael, but he is a vampire. And the angels--but totally vampires!--are reincarnated by blood droplets or something like that, and they retain all of the memories of their past lives, which all eventually lead back to the lost colony of Roanoke, but somehow Egypt is mentioned before that.So the main character here, Schuyler, is quite obviously One Of Them even though she's an outcast, but of course she is secretly beautiful and perfect and somehow ends up modeling even though she despises all rich kid hobbies.I think that part of the reason I can stomach Gossip Girl and I can't stomach this is that the GG characters actually have conflict. Yes, they're filthy rich snobs who don't have "real" problems and it's a shallow show, but there's conflict there. These girls had none of that drama, just the name brands and the location and the attitude. The biggest problem here, other than the fact that there's a freaking murderer on the loose, is that someone's wearing the wrong color to a funeral.I kind of like how there's at least an attempt at a different spin here, but the history is inaccurate (and not in the cute historical fiction way) I still have a vaguely bad taste in my mouth, like someone got the idea to make money off of the vampire trend, oh but that fallen angel thing sounds cool too and it's selling right now, so WHY NOT JUST BOTH?I am not sure I can force myself through the rest of the series, but just as surely as I say I can't, I'll be reading book two.
