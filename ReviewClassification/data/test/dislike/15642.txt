May contain spoilers or actually can it even contain spoilers when it still doesn't have a solid plot? (whatevz)[In the voice of Joker)Want to know why I got this headache? Well see I'm reading the Fallen series, the book has no plot, no foundation, I try to read on but it just gets worse. I'm trying to push to get through this book to see the end, but my brain doesn't like that.. Not.One.Bit. I put the book down the frustration in me is at boiling point and I can't believe I have spent money on this series! My boyfriend turns to me and says.. why so serious hun? I turn and look.. WHY SO SERIOUS? I FEEL LIKE I'M BANGING MY HEAD OFF A BRICK WALL!Ok so I am three books in, I'm still unclear why the hell Cam &amp; Dan fight over her at the end of the first book? WTF and where does the white linen pants come from at the end during the battle? Why does she trust someone so much after a month? Why do they argue so much in the whole 5 or so times they have met in this lifetime (seriously why?!!!) Then torment hes not even really in the book but he still seems to come across as a complete dick but I liked this one a lot more than the first.I have thought for the last two books that Dan was the douche but in this one Luce actually makes me want to punch her in the face, she is like a petulant child that is completely self centered who won't listen to anyone rushes into things ASS first and is just an arrogant little girl.4.0 student? Seriously no.So they are traveling all over time she is not an angel nor is she a demon, the story was lagging so much it gave me a sore head and I had to put the book down a few times as it wasn't enjoyable..When you did feel yourself getting into a bit of it Lauren would completely spiral off into something so irrelevant it was frustrating.The big reveal at the end, anticlimax! what even..?Anyway I'm about to start Rapture because as I have said before I bought all the series at once because the hype the book got, what a waste of trees.
