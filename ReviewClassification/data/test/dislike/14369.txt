Reminded of the book and what I've copy-pasted below by a comment a short while ago on this wonderful review:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show.... I haven't read this entire thing in probably three years or so, but a short search unveiled my dusty copy in a vile corner of my closet, lying next to an Enid Blyton book I nostalgically bought at a used bookstore once but never read. Reread about 40 pages ofFactotumand gave up before I threw up. So what follows is just a comment I posted on the review linked to above. But I think it's worth posting as it pretty much says everything I need to say about Chuck...I think what disturbs me about Bukowski is that he gets away with being a really ugly, awful person because he plays the bruised romantic card. This is especially evident w/r/t some women readers of Bukowski I've met, who seem to almost invariably adore at least aspects of his writing, offended though they are at the way he writes about women.But, you know, he's just a tremendous asshole who has no idea how to be a real human being and care about other people. He's good at depicting the pain and subtle terror of personal experience, but just has no clue about other people, male or female, as is evident from pretty much all his writing.For me, a large part of the dislike for Bukowski comes from my attraction to Bukowski's writing, or at least the idea of it. I mean, I've been a drunk, I used to smoke too much, I have (really) vomited into my typewriter. I've been shitty to a few women. Bukowski was big on calling himself honest, and his fans think he's real honest, too. But openness is not all that constitutes honesty. Bukowski is missing a critical faculty, an ability to understand that he needs to find a way out of his view of the world.So I guess the way I'd put the thing is that writers like DFW are, for me, the antidote to my attraction to the Bukowskis of the literary world. Cause if I let myself, I'm sure I would just read book after book of crap like this, and it gets just real solipsistic and self-serving and dark andlonely.John Fante'sAsk the Dust. Read that. It's like Bukowski but y'know, good and not lacking in any traces of empathy or an ability to write.
