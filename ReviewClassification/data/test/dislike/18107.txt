I feel like this book didn't quite have the same magic to me as the first three. However, I liked the first three a lot more after reading them a second time so I might feel different about this one too if I read it again.On the bad side, Bones and Cat fight a lot in this book. Maybe it's just me, but it felt really off. They butt heads and had a few fights in the first three books but not on the same level as this book. I think it's more that instead of their fights escalating throughout the book they were bickering and after each others heads from the start. I also thought things resolved between Cat and Bones way too easily. I wanted them to make up but with all the things they pull on each other I thought it would take a lot more time and work before they would forgive each other especially for Cat. I think my biggest issue though is that the first three books still kept a sense of humor and fun even when things got tense and complicated. I feel like that was missing in this book.But on the good side, it kept me up until 2 am to finish it in one night and is just as engrossing as the first three books in the series. I also like that Vlad played a role in this book too. There's some huge things happening in this book that kept me on the edge of my seat. As a whole though, even with my complaining i DID like the book. I just feel disappointed in it.
