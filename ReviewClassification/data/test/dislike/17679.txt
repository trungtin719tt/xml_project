Well, this is disappointing, so far. Damen is still a huge ass (600+ years old and he can't have a little patience with a 16-year-old? He can't be a little more sensitive and a little less horny? He can't stop being a brooding, mysterious, non-past-revealing teenager after six hundred years? Really?) and now Ever has become clingy while being obsessed over not having sex though she thinks she wants to but she's not ready but she should be because she has always died a virgin so she needs to hurry up and get it on but she has all of eternity so what's the rush but he really wants to because he's never been able to have sex with her and she should really just give him that and I AM GOING TO SLAP HER. I'm hoping things pick up and they stop being so incredibly irritating because, if that doesn't happen, I won't make it through the second CD.I listened to the whole thing and I will not be continuing this series. I'm still going to give Riley's story a try, but Ever and her I-really-need-to-have-sex-though-I-just-never-manage-it-and-OH-NO!-NOW-I-CAN'T!-oh-and-I-have-forgotten-how-to-use-reason drama can just go on without me.
