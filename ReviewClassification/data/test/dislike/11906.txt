I did actually read the entire book. Each week with some missionaries that discussed it with me. My grandparents are Mormon and after visiting the Temple in Salt Lake City on the way to California, I signed up for discussion. I love my grandparents and if some cult was going to take over their brain, I wanted to know what it was about. They seemed to be getting more intense with it as they grew older. I enjoyed the conversations. The reading itself was dry and full of parables that weren't enlightening. I have a hobby of reading religious books to see which parts could have happened by aliens coming down and making contact with humans. No I don't actually believe it, but it is fun to look for. This one had alot of spots that could be that. We had some good discussions on why black skin was considered Evil and why the belief was changed in modern times. Also good discussions on womens roles, polygamy, homosexuality, and Why their beliefs are constantly mutated. Tried to elaborate on how they can recognize that it is God talking to them and not just their psychosis. Overall it was informative and I walked away with a better understanding of what Mormons believe, most likely better than many Mormons. Once again my belief that religions prey on people who are in search of a quick answer to life the universe, and everything was confirmed.
