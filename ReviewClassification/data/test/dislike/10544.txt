2 "snarky, sensationalistic, schlocky" stars !!!Third Most Disappointing Read of 2018 AwardFirst of all an apology to my GR friends Debbie and Amanda who I know really loved this one...sorry gals I didn't so I'm going to rant !!Ummmm let's get this out of the way..... so frustrated !!Lionel Shriver can write ! She can write damn well with razor sharp observations on American Culture that are valid, important and on the mark !However...this book was such a miss on so many levels ---1. Kevin is so very unbelievable as a character...he is better cast as a villainous robot in a sci-fi novel2. The events were so bloody sensationalistic that they take away from the real pathos and tragedy of mass school shootings3. This is a spoiler ....(view spoiler)[ If a mother suspected that her son put out her baby daughter's eye ...there is no way in hell that she would allow him near her again !!(hide spoiler)]4. Another spoiler....(view spoiler)[ A teacher would never have a tribunal with only parents and principal present and have the boys testify in that forum for sexual abuse(hide spoiler)]5. A baby could never be as manipulative or cunning the way Kevin is portrayed....even if he needed an exorcist due to demonic posession (jk)6. Reasons 1 to 5 are enough to bring this book into one star category but because Shriver is such a good writer and observer of American Culture I am generously bringing it up to a two.So yeah we really do need to talk about Kevin but not for the reasons you are thinking !!
