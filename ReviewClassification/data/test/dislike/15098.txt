This book wasn't as good as I'd expected, but what disappointed me more than anything was how much of a jerk Emily was to Chris. Through memories, it's seen that Emily used Chris as a scapegoat for all her wrongdoings in childhood, like stealing a sex book from the local library and drinking alcohol. And then she kills herself and gets Chris implicated in her murder... and it's implied that she hates just about everyone and everything, and that perhaps Chris was just her escape, not her friend.This is one of those few, far and in-between cases where the film is better than the book... :(
