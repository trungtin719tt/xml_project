I know I shouldn't compare the book to the Disney movie, but still I expected more from it. Half of the stories aren't even about Mowgli, but were some old Indian sagas or something that didn't really interest me. The Mowgli stories were fun reads, but the other stories I didn't really like. So therefore only two stars...
