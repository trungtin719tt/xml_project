This was interesting. I did read the whole thing, but when I was getting to the end I was starting to think, "Is this worth the time I have spent on it?"It was overall an uplifting story. Probably my favorite aspect was the peek into life in a small Tennessee Mountain town at the turn of last century. I couldn't help but wonder if that's how some Arkansas towns were, too.I did like the ending.That said, there was much that I disliked about this book. It seemed very dated, like I was watching a 70s movie, or something. There were some very heavy themes, such as rape, death of a baby, abuse and neglect, etc. I did not particularly like the way they were handled. It was almost like they were included to make the story interesting, since after all, this was the 70s, and we can talk about whatever we want.I'd be curious to hear what any of you thought of this book if you have read it. A good friend had highly recommended it to me, and I have to admit I was disappointed.
