My opinion on Nora during this entire book:Go ahead, Nora. Ignore everyone's advice. Drink more of the 'evil-demon-magic' potion and screw everything up. Go ahead!! SEE IF I CARE.________________(The 'WHEN I FINISHED' REVIEW:)I finished Finale. I reached the end!Fortunately, there is no 'Encore'.But now I have finished it in one sitting I realised that it's...HOLY MOLY IT'S ALMOST ELEVEN O'CLOCK!!Sleep calls.Dreams call.And Patch will hopefully be in every single one of them.Adios and sweet dreams - I'll review this end to the series tomorrow, when I'm functioning on less than seven hours sleep, trying to keep my eyes open whilst craving coffee.
