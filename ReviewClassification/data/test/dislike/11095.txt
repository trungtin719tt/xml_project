*Sing to the tune of Blank Space*"Reading this book felt like torture. Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn ya."Angst. The angst iseverywhere.I tried with this book, I really did but the plot just got even more muddled after the Uglies. I could not stop myself from rolling my eyes and suppressing the urge to fling this book across the room every 5 minutes.Let's take a moment to look at this synopsis:Tally Youngblood is popular and Prettyville boyfriend Zane leads the Crims gang. But Croy from her past smuggles in a message and pills. Her best friend Shay is jealous. Evil Dr Cable from the Specials is in pursuit. How can she reconcile her past, present, and future?I didn't even read this until now but I am literally cringing. This sounds like a melodramatic soap opera or some type of Broadway musical. It got so bad that I wouldn't even be surprised if they just suddenly burst into song, High School Musical style. I don't even know anymore.Right off the bat you're thrust with this new "pretty" slang now that Tally has turned Pretty. There's no explanation and you have to define things on your own from here on out. The amount of times they said "bubbly or bogus" in this novel is outrageous.I was tempted to claw out my eyeballs.I had no idea know where this story was going, it was all over the place. Tally is pretentious typical YA "heroine" who some how thinks she is smart but doesn't have a lick of sense in her. She is constantly has to be coaxed by the male counterpart in order for her to do something it's ridiculous. I'm surprised how quick she rebounded with Zane.*my hope for ya romance falls off a cliff*Zane had as much personality as my big toe.It felt as if he came out of nowhere and all of sudden Tally is dating him and how "bubbly making" he is. (You can hear me gagging all across the world)Shay I could stand in the first book but here she became my most hated character.(Even more than Tally. Shocker!! :0)Shay is even more unbelievably annoying in this book that I literally skimmed her dialogue. The fact that she suddenly turned into Tally's nemesis is preposterous. Who knows if I'll even finish this series, but we all know that's totallybogus.(Ha!)
