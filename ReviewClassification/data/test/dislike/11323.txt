TCL Call #: YA Cast POk. So this is the 6th in the House of Night series and while I've been recommending these as light tweener-early teen reading I can't anymore. It's like the authors know they have a series going. If they just spend the first part of the book rehashing how the last one ended, fill the middle with useless and frankly inane teen hand wringing, they can end with one plot advancement that will make their readers pick up the next in the series.I felt like I was reading a Dan Brown novel for tweens where nothing really happens and all the symbols and plot themes are gleaned off of other writers or historical events. Yawn.So in this one the main vampire has just won a major battle against the lead bad guy (he's immortal but fallen - the Bible anyone?). Of course this means we spend the first third of the book discussing this battle and the what-ifs and can-you-believes. Yup. Then we go into the middle third where this main vampire has lusty dreams about the fallen immortal because it turns out in a previous life whe was his consort. Sigh. This is with her juggling her three current this-life boyfriends who are the hottest and all just want to be with her. The human jock who is fine with the other boys because he knows they are meant-to-be, the undead alternative vampire who just wants to protect her (and make out), and the vampire school hottie. So you see, the authors have covered all the bases so the geek teen reader can imagine being sooooooo desirable.Oh - and toss in endless "Goddess be" bull-poopie (a word from the book!)because of course there's this vampire religion which is just Christianity flipped to have a female god. Ohhhh - the creativity!'K so the final third of the book is the main vampire chick has to yet again confront the immortal but how will it end? How indeed. If they told you you would never pick up the next book would you?
