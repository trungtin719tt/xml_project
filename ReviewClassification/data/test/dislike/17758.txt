This novel had been lying about my house in India for a long time: an old copy somebody abandoned (I couldn't even recognise the name written on the cover). Old houses gather books like they do other things (moth-eaten clothes, faded photographs and chipped chinaware). This vacation, it kept on intruding itself into my consciousness so I saidWhat the hell!and finally decided to read it.The book pulled me into it at the beginning. I liked the roundabout way Shute approached the story of Jean Paget through her uncle's will and his solicitor, Noel Strachan (who is also the story's narrator) - the legalese and leisurely pace of the story was so very British. Then, we are suddenly plunged into war-torn Malaya and the personal heroism of Jean and her Australian admirer, Joe Harman: extremely gripping stuff.Bud sadly, for me, after that the novel began to flag - it became a sort of travelogue about the Australian outback mixed up with and instruction booklet on "How to Set Up Business in Rural Australia". I became so bored that I only skimmed the last third.Still I give it two stars for the gripping first half and the sympathetic portrayal of Malays and even the Japanese - without a hint of racism: a relative rarity for a book first published in 1950.
