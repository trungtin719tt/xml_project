Stegner won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1972 for this book. Goes to show you that you should disregard my reviews! Absolutely no taste, whatsoever. This book took me over two months to read because I kept putting it down. Down being the operative word here. It was not only a "downer", but lacked the skill of a good editor. In today's publishing world, Stegner wouldn't have gotten away with such a ponderous, heavy book. This was written in the "old way," with the author making it apparent that he had an eternity to tell his story. There are tons of good reviews about Angle of Repose on this website that tell about the plot, and so I'll leave that to you to discover. Really, when I was done reading it I felt like a heavy load was taken off my back, so I truly don't want to revisit the story. Trin, who gave a review on this website, expressed my feelings: "This fits into the category of "Books I feel I ought to like but really, really don't."
