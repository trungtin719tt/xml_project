For One More Day, like all of Mitch Albom's books, attempts to be an exercise in feel-good warm fuzzies. This overly-verbose mortality tale, however, is not particularly inspiring, uplifting, or even interesting.When the main character tries to commit suicide, he gets to spend the titular "one more day" with his deceased mother. During the visit, he reminisces about his life growing up in a broken home, the mistakes he made, and how we would do it differently if he could. Interspersed are example after example of how he did not stand up for his single mother and/or how she did stand up for him.The problem with "For One More Day" is that the emotional claptrap and manipulation don't have even a remotely satisfying payoff. There are no lessons learned, no flash of insight. Instead, it seems as if Albom stuck his "Five People you Meet in Heaven" in a blender with "It's a Wonderful Life," drank it down, and then vomited it back up into print. It's boring, uninspiring, frustrating, and vapid. This morality tale could have been condensed into a Reader's Digest article and contained the same emotional punch.For a set of real-life lessons about the preciousness of life, drop "For One More Day" into the trash can where it belongs and go find a used copy of "Tuesdays with Morrie."
