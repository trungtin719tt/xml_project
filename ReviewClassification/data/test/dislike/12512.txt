Verbose, repetitive, contradictory: a book of 200-pages that could be condensed to 3-5 pages.Titles that vary from scintillating to insulting, yet are followed by a chapter that doesn't support the title bar.Anecdotal stories, mistaken for data or hypothesis. Interpretations and hypotheses are drawn from data that could still be interpreted in multiple ways.The book claims that it will link the unexpected, but frankly, links the obvious, with many "well duh" moments.Needless generations of lists that help bulk out the book, but provide little further benefit for study.Each chapter begins with unnecessary aggrandisement of the author for the statistician, that jars the flow of the book.Overall, a good demonstration of why "social sciences" are in no way close to being "science", and instead should be termed social philosophy.
