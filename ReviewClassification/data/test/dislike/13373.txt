This book is infuriating. The prose is ponderous, self-indulgent and nonsensical, at every opportunity taking turns of phrase so purple and baffling, that I can only understand them as symptomatic of a woefully adolescent conception of what "poetic" or "serious" prose would look like. (I'd insert an example but really I can't face opening the book again to look for one). Probably connected to that, Bradbury's child characters talk and think like world weary 80 year olds. I can't remember the last time I stopped reading a book because it sucked: usually I vet my reading choices pretty accurately and if that doesn't work I'll find something interesting about it and plow through anyway. This book I threw down after page 60 with something approaching rage.P.S.: Here's a passage from the novel I plucked at random from one of the other reviews on Goodreads (no offense to that person or to the bazillion other readers who apparently worship this book):"Oh, what strange wonderful clocks women are. They nest in Time. They make the flesh that holds fast and binds eternity. They live inside the gift, know power, accept, and need not mention it. Why speak of time when you are Time, and shape the universal moments, as they pass, into warmth and action? "I guess if you like this, you'll just love Something Wicked this Way Comes. I, however, can't help but see it is as a perfect specimen of the nonsense gibberish that passes for "profound" writing in this novel (and in this case it's a fairly essentializing and sexist bit of nonsense as well).
