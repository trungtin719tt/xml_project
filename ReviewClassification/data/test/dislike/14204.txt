The first few books in this series were good. They were fun, easy reads and guilty-pleasure material. The last few books have been a chore to read, though. While the characters were not as annoying in this book (due to Zoey not really being present) the writing was irritating. I did not understand the reason for switching narrators every few pages. It added nothing to the story and broke it up too much. I have never been a fan of the Kalona plot which was particularly boring in this book. I really like Aphrodite as a character and I think it's a shame she's been pushed to the side and treated so badly by the other characters. I keep reading these books in hopes that they'll return to what they were at the start but I'm not sure how likely that is.
