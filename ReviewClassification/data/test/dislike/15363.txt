Okay, I worked thru all seven of these "Dark Tower" Books because the first one was short and sweet and really caught my interest. And because they were "non-King-like" compared to his other books (which I don't particularly like). While a few of the books in this series are pretty good, they are hardly comparable tothe Lord of the Rings, which I'm not a big fan of either. But I can tell really good story-telling from wandering around.Of the previous six books in this series, they had some truly memorable and exciting episodes. Book 4 "Wizards and Glass" was excellent and was enough to keep me waiting all those years with everyone else for the next installment. In other places, the series wandered around aimlessly in boring descriptions of what you usually find in most Stephen King books: Stephen King, via his growing-up days. Yeah, I know, one of the golden rules of writing is "write what you know." But c'mon. King even becomes a main character in this final book, and in the worst possible way!! Which you'll discover if you get that far. Another golden rule of writing: "When you're stuck for ideas, start killing off the main characters." Well, guess what. I could kind of forgive the first one in Book 6 (barely), but Book 7 was unforgivable. I put the book down halfway through and don't care about it anymore.Obviously I liked the Dark Tower books enough to keep reading them, but like any series that takes years to finish, you feel that you really know the characters after a while. In this final book, there are a few genuinely moving moments toward the beginning, but that's about all King can sustain. All I can say is, the final book is a betrayal. Sorry.
