I considered giving this two stars but then I realized there really wasn't anything I liked about it. It was so boring and it took me more than a week to get through. I know it's too much to ask that Dan Brown scale the heights ofAngels &amp; Demonsor evenThe Da Vinci Codeonce again but I'm somewhat baffled as to how his writing has taken a turn for the worse and it started with that blastedThe Lost Symbol.There's nothing much to say about this to be honest. The plot was kind of intriguing mostly because it raised ethical questions and provided food for thought but the characters were so underdeveloped and felt really flat. As a result of this, I wasn't invested in any of them or the story. It all just plodded along with me quirking an eyebrow here and there and wondering when it was going to end. I certainly don't understand why it took so many pages to tell this very mediocre story. As it usually goes with Dan Brown books this read like a tour of ancient buildings in ancient cities and while these would have been great to explore on a tour in person or even read in a guide book, Brown does a terrible job of interweaving the story and these 'attractions'Would I recommend this to anyone? Not really. There's nothing to see here so I would encourage you to keep it moving.
