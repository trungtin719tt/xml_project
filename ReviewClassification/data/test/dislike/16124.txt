I really enjoyed Fight Club. I thought it was inventive and clever, well constructed and in it's way very honest.I knew I was going to finish this book (Survivor), it was easy to read. I read it a few years ago and don't remember much at all about it story wise, but I do recall feeling like people who liked Fight Club are supposed to fall in line with this, and it didn't feel like he had really put the effort in.Apparently people really liked this book, I know many people gave it a lot of stars.I don't agree with them.
