Ok, its regular sized animals living in a human sized world. Where are the humans? Why is there a human sized horse and wagon that the evil rats ride on? These are just some of the questions I pondered as I read through this snooze fest.This book is quite literally a regular mouse picking up a tiny little sword, and fighting various things(snakes, rats, my will to live!). Now if the image of a little mouse holding a tiny sword doesn't want to make you retch at the absurd "oh how cute" nature of the story, then I don't know what will.I just can't recommend this book, even to kids. When I look at kids buying this book I think, "were all the good and cool books already taken?" Artemis Fowl, Harry Potter, John Bellair, Philip Pullman,...etc as the list goes on and on of people who wrote and are writing more interesting stories than members of the rodent and bird species having a cute little war with evil weasles and rats. Thats why I have to say I hated this book.
