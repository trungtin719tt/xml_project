Since these books are going to be a T.V show in Sept, I thought I'd buy the books...Some people have read it and compared it to Twilight, but I have to say that these books are NOTHING like Twilight except for the part where she's human and the brothers aren't. But that's about it.So I've read the first one "The Awakening and The Struggle" and I have to say that I was kind of disappointed.Elena is an uptight snobby girl who gets what ever she wants and when she doesn't she pouts like a 2 year old out to get revenge and sneak in her mothers pantry to steal chocolate!Her character does improve through out the book, but she was very hard to relate to while reading.Stefan spends half the book ignoring her ( yes, for a good reason, but still) then when he does finally talk to her...BANG! They are together and "in love"???I like Damon, at least he's consistent as the "bad guy" in the book. His character is very sexy and very mysterious....I just felt like the books did not show just cause as to WHY these two love each other? Not to compare this to Twilight, but at least with those books, it showed the progression stage of Edward and Bella's relationship.Elena and Stefan have nothing more then a ghost of a memory and some heated attraction for one another?There was nothing to lead them up to there romance. Elena thought of him as a challenge and for Stefan, Elena just reminded him of a girl he use to love...Damon is the only character that comes into play that I can understand. He was the one who lurked from afar and didn't try to disguise his obsession with love. His was purely lust. I think this is the first time I have ever rooted for the bad guy to get the girl. I want Elena to be with Damon, Stefan just isn't doing it for me I guess.I don't hate the books, but I don't love them either.The only reason I'm giving this two stars is for plot and writing style.I just wish the time was taken for us to feel why they were in love and not just have it there.It's sad to say that I think the T.V Series will be better then the books.
