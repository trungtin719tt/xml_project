I knew the premise of this book was teenage suicide but I still found it very disturbing. As a mother I could not imagine anything more devasting then the loss of your child, by whatever means.Picoult's sequence of events was intersting - the timeline moved back and forth so that the reader was able to get a sense of how close both families were. I was not able to relate to Emily's pain at all. Yes, she was sexually abused as a child in a fast food restaurant, but if she was as smart we are led to believe, she should have sought some sort of therapy. She carried this pain for years and never told her parents, friends, teachers or even Chris, her soul mate. I just wanted to shake her and tell her to get some help - look at all the good things you have in your life!! Emily was a talented artist, loved by her parents, Chris, her friends and teachers. She had so much to live for and accomplish in her life. I found her character weak and was not sympathic to her struggles.I felt sorry for Emily and Chris' parents. They both lost a person they love and Chris' family was struggling through their son's imprisonment and trial. The teenagers families were once so close and now Emily's mother becomes bitter and vindictive and her father looks for comfort from Chris' mother.Chris is left to deal with Emily's death. I don't agree with his actions at all - he should have informed her parents that their daughter was hurting and needed help. No matter how much he loved Emily he could have said NO to her - he would not help her kill herself. Chris must change in order to survive in prison and to live with his decision to help with the suicide.He struggles to go on with his life and to find some belief to cling to.
