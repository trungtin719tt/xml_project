I must be the only one who read this and found it more depressing than funny.Although there were a couple of times I laughed (few, to be honest, but enough to make me not hate this book), I didn't like Stephanie Plum at all. I am not saying we should all be scared and sit in our house because we might get hurt, but there is being wise and there is being Stephanie. The book summary is way better than the book itself.You know those films where a cop is accused of something and he sets out to clear his name? Everyone likes those. Well, imagine watching it but from the perspective of a side character who is doing everything in her power to undermine what he is trying to do. The worst thing is she isn't doing it because she is a bad person or evil. That would be this book in a nutshell.I don't mind light humorous stories. I just find Stephanie annoying here.It is possible that I wasn't in the right mood for this. Maybe the second book is more entertaining and the main character grows on me. I doubt it since it seems the whole series is one messy love triangle. I hate them.
