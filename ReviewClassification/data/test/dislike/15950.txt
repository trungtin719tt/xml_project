I almost liked this book. Almost an added star.This is my 4th Sparks book. Message in a Bottle (2 stars). The Lucky One (1 star). Three Weeks With My Brother (1 star).This is the winning book for February 2011 Bestseller Book chosen by The Filipino Group here in Goodreads. I bought this book at regular price. I waited for the mass paperback (cheaper) edition but it is almost a year now since this book came out. February just started and I was about to open the thread (I am one of the moderators of that group) so I grabbed me a copy. I am saying this just to explain that Ihave to lovethis book because I spent a fortune for it and I should try to entice members to read by coming up with a fair review.Which is a roller coaster.First hundred pages:Typical Sparks. Reading him is like eating at McDonalds. You know the taste. No surprises. If you want quick fix to your hunger, you pass by an outlet. Quality food at reasonable price. What I am saying is that there isnothing wrongwith Nicholas Sparks' novels. You want romance, you get romance. You just read to be entertained, you get entertained. You don't want mind-boggling read, you just read and no need to think. You get what you expect.Second hundred pages:So I thought. Because suddenly, Nicholas Sparks made a detour. Unlike the first 3 books, he tried to become something that he hasn't done before. He tried to write a suspense thriller novel. Ala Ken Follett. Sparks caught my attention. He pulled it off as he stole some of my sleeping time. I slept only for only 3 hours that night as I got caught up with the mystery behindKatie(who turns out to beErin) and how is her life being a battered wife. Totally unexpected. Definitely nohums-humsin the wee hours of the morning!Last 50 pages:Unfortunately, this part did not fly for me. It seems too ordinary. Eventhatrevelation aboutJo.Seems contrived and I read and saw many of that in this lifetime: The Sixth Sense (movie), The Others (movie), Pedro Paramo (book). Even the battered wife part. I saw or read about it in Sleeping with the Enemy (Julia Robert's novel), Black and Blue (book) and I supposed most of those Oprah books. So when I closed the book and went through the plot in my mind, I just did not like the whole story. Sparks tried to makeKevin'scharacter multilayered and it was a nice try but Sparks did not explain his background. I thought that a page or two of his life as a child could make a lot of difference.Alexand his children seem like not characters at all. They are like stuff toys with what I think areso-typicalcharacterizations. They are like movie starlets trying to win people by smiling a lot and saying all the right things.But this doesn't mean that I will not drop by a McDonald's outlet anymore. I mean we, once in a while, get hungry and have just enough money (for a burger) to spend, right?
