i don't think there's any way of getting around the fact that i really, really didn't like this book AT ALL. which sucks because i spent quite a bit of money on it, thinking it'd be a great read and fun to read before i dove into the first season of the t.v. show.alas, it irked me so much i didn't even get past the first part. boooo.love the cover though. paul wesley + ian somerhalder = HELL. YES.also: i love the tv series. i should probably have stuck to that instead.
