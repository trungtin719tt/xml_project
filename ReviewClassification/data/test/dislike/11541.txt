I was sick of Eggers'self-absorbed schtick after three pages of the preface. But, the cover read"pulitzer prize finalist" (among other superlatives), so I forged on. I'd madeit to page 33 of the actual text (without laughing once) when I noticed Eggers'picture on the back cover. He reminded me of some people I'd met when I wasworking at a startup company during the early internet boom. They were so fullof themselves with their free-wheeling style, their stock options, and theirflat-front banana-republic slacks. I felt they were full of shit, but it tookme awhile to act on that feeling with confidence, and, thus, to stay in school. Historyultimately proved me right. Therefore, I decided to learn from that history,and I threw this book in the trash.
