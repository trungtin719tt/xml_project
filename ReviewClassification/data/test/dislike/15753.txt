The Good:The beginning and very end of this book were very fast-paced and enticing. I enjoyed the mysterious characters and that the author allows the reader to know what many are thinking and feeling through various viewpoints. The plot-line of this book was very original.The Bad:I felt like I was reading the Bible at times: So many characters were introduced throughout the entirety of the book, and it was difficult to keep up with them and their various personalities. It was also difficult to keep up with the varying attempts to sabotage a fair trial.The Ugly:I got bored towards the middle of the book and had to force myself to continue reading. If I hadn't been 200+ pages in already, I probably wouldn't have finished it.
