Ho-hum.That's about all I can say about this book. I was really excited to read I Am Legend and the first 70 pages were astounding, but then it just slowly got less and less enjoyable.You can't blame Matheson, though. When this book was first published in the mid-50s it was the first of its kind. A novella that took a scientific approach to explaining a virus that turned all but Robert Neville into a vampire.Reading the novel I kept thinking "I've heard this before" but, I realize now that Matheson was probably the first to do it, but now 50 years later others have done it...and better.If you are interested in this genre I would definitely read the book. Maybe two stars is a little too rough, but I'm not going to mask my disappoint in how a story can start so promisingly and just taper off so terribly. The ending was totally anti-climatic and I could see it coming from a mile away.This collection also had several short stories by Matheson and I read a few before giving up. They suffer from the same fate as I Am Legend. Matheson was the first, but over the years other people have taken his ideas and improved on them.
