1.5 "I'm too old for this shit" starsIt was all so stupid. There's nothing good to say about it. Meghan is a moron. If it wasn't for her merry gang of followers, she either be dead or someone's slave by now. Whenever something happens someone always pops up at just the right time to save her. People continually warn her that Fairyland is dangerous especially since she doesn't know the rules and customs. Apparently she isn't capable of heeding anyone else's advice. She makes one mistake after another only digging herself into a deeper hole. Then she seems shocked when the thing that people told her would happen happens.All of the characters act like petulant children. Meghan is young, so it's somewhat excusable. Most of them are supposed to be hundreds or thousands of years old. They're all so rash. Every time their feelings get hurt they immediately lash out. All of them use modern slang and simple language. Maybe it's wrong of me to expect ancient beings to be more sophisticated and cunning.Some things in this didn't make sense. 1) Oberon asked Mab to release Meghan and let her go with him. She said no, and he was basically like well okay and rides off into the sunset. WTF? He is the king of half of fairyland. It's pathetic to give up so easily. Shouldn't someone of his caliber excel at bargaining? 2) Mab said Oberon couldn't have her back because she made a deal with Ash to come to her. Wouldn't that bargain have been fulfilled when she went back with Ash? She didn't specify that she would stay for any length of time. No one ever noticed this. Fae are supposed to be crafty and manipulative and spot pathetic loopholes like that a mile away. 3) When Megan bargained with a fae in the last book and agreed to give up a memory, why is it that she can no longer remember the man she believed to be her father? She got fucking screwed on that deal. IMO that's a lot of memories that were taken, not just one because someone being in a person's life for 10 years comprises far more than one memory. None of these crafty fae saw that something was off with that situation either.The love triangle was one of lamest, most pathetic love triangles ever. It was clear inThe Iron Kingthat Puck had feelings for Meghan although it wasn't brought up. She and Ash lusted after each other. Neither of her relationships with them felt solidified romantically. From the start of this she acted like Ash was the love of her life.(view spoiler)[She proclaimed very early in the book that she loved him. I was blindsided because she didn't know him well at all.(hide spoiler)]He had to put on a show and act like he hated her to protect her from his family. She was too stupid to understand what was going on even though he tried to explain how it was going to be beforehand. She was hysterical half of the time, going on and on about how she couldn't be without him. It didn't take long for her to inexplicably develop feelings for Puck, all the while still thinking of Ash. It was resolved at the end and went the way I expected it to, but it would have been so much better if there hadn't been a bunch of bullshit along the way.
