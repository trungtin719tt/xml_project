I wanted to read this series before the show started this fall.. as the books are normally better than the shows/movies, but I have to say that I was highly disappointed. I can understand why Stefan would fall for her instantly, but I thought it was kind of cheesy and far fetched that she would fall madly in love with him before she even knows anything about him. story was very flat, the main character Elana got on my nerves, and there were a few parts where I had to re-read something more than once because it just didn't make any sense. I don't have any desire to read any further, but I will probably still try watching the show however I probably won't like that either.
