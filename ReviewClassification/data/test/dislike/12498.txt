***Disclaimer: I only read until about 80-90 pages (which is a damn lot) then read the summary of the rest.Normally I wouldn't review school reads because technically I've only been forced to read them, but I need to express my frustrations overSense and Sensibility. So here are the top five reasons why I decided to give up on the book completely:1.)The writing style was too flowery.And y'all know I hate flowery writing. Okay, fine, this book was written decades ago, and I probably should've picked up a more modern revision of it... But you get my point. It was just too much for my goldfish brain to handle.2.)The characters made me want to tear their eyeballs off.I couldn't stand any of them--Marianne was way too assuming; Elinor was too cold; Willoughby was an ass; Colonel Brandon was a martyr... EVERYONE was just so bipolar and hot-and-cold. Yeah, no thanks. Get out of my sight, please.3.)The story was too scripted and unnatural.You're probably going, But Aimee, this is a fictional book! And I'll say, Yes it is. But unrealistic contemporary novels can only go so far for me. There was a number of love triangles and even love squares that just didn't make any sense to me. Also, everyone keeps complaining about money but no one actually works in the book. What even!?So yes, this book. I might still attempt reading a modern revision of Austen's some time in the future, but not anytime soon. My brain's still fried from eventryingto read this one.
