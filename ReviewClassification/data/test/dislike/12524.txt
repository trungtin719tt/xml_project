I could not finish this book. It made me cringe twice on each of the hundred odd pages that I did force myself to read.Would I recommend this book to you? If you don't know how people use statistics to detect fraud, go ahead and read this book. You will find it to be entertaining and informative. On the other hand, if you feel strongly about the difference between correlation and causality and already know what, say, Benford's law is, spare yourself the horror. You will find yourself reaching for the wall (to bang your head on) by page 10.Also, the title is a bit misleading. This book is NOT about economics.
