I have to admit, I'm a little surprised this is/was marketed to kids, especially kids like I was who didn't need any help overriding the rules and being utterly sarcastic.That said, this is such a weird book to return to as an adult. It takes about ten minutes to read, mostly because all of the tales have been boiled down to reality--like, if a duckling is ugly, it will likely grow up to be an ugly duck. The end. When your stories are only about two pages long, it's kind of a short book.The thing I really appreciate about this book (and that would give it an extra half star, if Goodreads did halvsies) is the way it plays with printing and layout. Margins, fonts, page matching, even the ISBN barcode on the back of the book are fair game for Scieszka, and I love that imaginative interaction with the physicality of the book. The stories are blah, mostly because fairy tales aren't all that interesting when you introduce them to things like reality and practicality. But the layout is great.Except for the illustrations. The illustrations kind of freak me out, in a Picasso-cubist sort of way.And I have to say, the interrupting hen is pretty much my favorite part of the book. Who, indeed, will help her plant her wheat? Certainly not that ISBN guy.
