The movie came out a few weeks ago, and I haven't seen it yet. I figured this would be a good time to write a review about this book, since I read it a few months ago, but never got a chance to review it.This book was highly recommended to me, because although I really do read a bit of everything I find chick-lit to be the most entertaining. When I'm in a bad mood I can sit down with a chick-lit about some crazy chick with usually unrealistic problems that makes my life seem boring and laugh my butt off until my mood perks up. Chick-lit is like chocolate to me in that way.I know that comedy is subjective, but I didn't laugh reading this book once. I don't get it. That was supposedly this books biggest selling point. Also, I was able to read the whole thing since it was super short, but I thought about quitting this one about 10 times in a very short period. Why? It just wasn't that interesting. Stephanie is a broke girl who decides to become a bounty hunter to make money. The first person she needs to pick up is a guy that she hooked up with years ago. Most of the book seemed really corny to me, and that's saying a lot, considering I normally don't mind that in chick-lits. The plot was pretty boring, predictable and unable to hold my attention.The characters. They were genuine and felt real, but again didn't interest me at all. The love triangle starts from book one, and now here we are several years, and many books later and apparently that's still her big choice?Needless to say this is one of the most hyped, critically acclaimed chick-lits I have ever heard of. Everyone who is into cozies always says this is the best. Also, everyone who recommended it said those things like "I'm hooked" or "You will NOT be able to put this one down!"...Me? Not so much.I'm wondering if I'm missing something here or if the series just improves greatly as the books go on. Right now after reading "One for the Money" I don't think Stephanie, her love triangle, and her strange family are people I want to invest the time in. There are like 18 books so far to this series now I think. I will probably try #2 in the future since everyone highly recommended this series to me, and some have insisted that it get's better.This book obviously has tons of fans so I recommend if you like chick-lit give it a try and see how you like it. I feel like I'm one of the only women in the world who isn't a fan of this series, but oh well.I will stick with Sophie Kinsella for my chick-lit fixes from now on.1.5/5 stars
