I freely admit that I saw Griffin Dunne's film adaptation before reading the novel itself, so I had high expectations. What I'm about to say next is rare for me: I was actually very disappointed with this book. Yes, it delved nicely into the intricate relationships between the sisters, their aunts, the psychotic boyfriend, etc., but the fact of the two sisters being witches was barely mentioned, much less any detail regarding their magical abilities. This was one of -- if not THE -- main reasons I adored the movie. Those elements (along with the chemistry between actresses Sandra Bullock, Nicole Kidman, and the others) kept the film highly engaging for me as an audience member. I'll go so far as to say that it's one of my Top 10 films of All Time, possibly even within the Top 5. I kept pushing through each chapter with some effort, hoping so much to finally have light shed on Gillian and Sally as witches as well as their family legacy. Sad to say, upon reaching the final page of the book, I honestly felt my time had been wasted.For those of you who really enjoyed this book, more power to you. I'm very happy that you were delighted by it. Unfortunately, for me, the reading was not a pleasant one.
