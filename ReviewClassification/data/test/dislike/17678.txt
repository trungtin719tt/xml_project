I should not have read this book. It was not good for my brain.And I knew this when I checked this book out from the library. Because the first one was possibly one of the worst things I'd ever read. So, honestly, did I expect the second one to be worth reading?But I was curious. I really wanted to know what could possibly be in the sequel to Evermore. So, well, here we are.I won't rant about the problems it shares with its predecessor; I expected those, in all of their copious glory. (Though I was a bit surprised to find that Buttercup is still, apparently, a hermaphrodite, having been called both a "he" and a "she," once again on the same freaking page.) And, really, it didn't have any problems that the first book didn't. In fact, the protagonist (and thus the narration) is, I'm going to say, less annoying, less inconsistent, and less of a sloppy mess. So, that's a plus. She's still pretty insufferable, though. So is Damen, just like before, but - here's another plus - he gets much less screen time and dialogue in this book. Score!The plot is about as non-existant/full of holes/terrible as it was in the first book. However, Drina, our (inadvertently) comically inept villain (with a much too convoluted plan) from the first book has been replaced with Roman, our (inadvertently) comically inept villain (with a much to convoluted plan) from this book. But, hey, he didn't get killed with the power of love. Double score! Also, he, like, half managed to succeed. And by that, if I have interpreted the book correctly, I mean, "totally succeeded." Maybe this would lead to a triple score, as I really don't like the protagonists of this series and would enjoy watching someone completely out-smart them, except that he took a whole freaking book to accomplish what I - even without omnipotent powers that "immortal juice" apparently gives you sometimes - could have accomplished in like, an hour, provided I already had the plot devices of alchemy stuff (which the protagonist pretty much got simply by asking some random lady) a syringe, and a large frying pan for beating both the protagonist and her love interest over the heads until unconscious. And you know, I could probably replace the syringe with a very sharp toothpick, and the frying pan with a sock, because I am sure both Ever and Damen have very soft and therefore sensitive skulls.So, this book is actually slightly better than the first one. But it's still pretty bad. When reading it, to keep yourself from falling asleep, I would recommend reading all of Roman's dialogue out loud in an amazingly fake British/Cockney accent. This can be disappointing as Roman isn't really in all that much of the book, but it certainly does pay off in the end, possibly giving me enough giggles to justify checking this book out from the library.
