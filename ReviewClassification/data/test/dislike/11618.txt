2,5* / I don't know, maybe I'm too stupid to appreciate this story.I was basically bored throughout the whole book. I didn't feel anything for the characters and even the atmosphere didn't quite get to me.I liked the writing style though and Eleanor as a narrator was really interesting.I'm still having hopes for the Netflix show!! I heard nothing but awesome things, so I'm really curious about it.Update: I just finished the show and wooooooow that was heartbreaking and beautiful and SO well done.I can definitely recommend it!
