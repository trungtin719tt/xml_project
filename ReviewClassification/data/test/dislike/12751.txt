This was incredibly disappointing. Ms. Keller's book is too lighthearted. I have an immense respect for people who live, learn, and succeed against all odds but Ms. Keller's account of her early years is all sunshine and daisies. It is not believeable or real. There is no heartache, anger, or frustation that we all know that had to be a part of her daily life. She goes into way too much detail describing flowers and people and books she likes. There is no substance. Uggh... and I wanted to like it :(
