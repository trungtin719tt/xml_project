The cheese factor is pretty high for this one, people.When Logan Thibault, a Marine serving in Iraq, finds a picture of a pretty woman in the sand, his friend Vincent considers it to be Thibault's good luck charm. Thibault doesn't, but whatever. Once out of the Marines, Thibault tracks down Elizabeth -- the woman in the photo -- by walking -- yes, walking -- from his Colorado home to a small North Carolina town. There, he finds out she's a single mother. And her ex-husband, a deputy, is an asshole. But lo, Elizabeth runs a kennel on the side, and Thibault has an awesome German Shepherd. Clearly it was meant to be.Parts of the book were illogical... It's mentioned that Thibault attended Colorado University in Boulder. After graduation, he joined the military -- knowing he'd be sent to Iraq. Why? I haven't a clue. Apparently, neither does Sparks. Ahem... CU Boulder is a party school for rich kids. Tuition runs thirty grand a year. NONE of those kids sign up for military service upon graduation. At a state college -- maybe, if you were concerned you couldn't find a job. A community college -- sure, to give yourself a better life. But spending 120 grand on an education and then enlisting (for no reason) to possibly get killed in Iraq? No effing way.So there's that.In addition, the writing was just plain sloppy. Characters randomly appeared or disappeared for convenience sake -- Nana; or were brought in for huge chapters for exposition sake -- Melody, anyone? -- and then never mentioned again.Cliches and caricatures reigned. Clayton, Elizabeth's ex was an overwrought, unbelievable villian. But Thibault and Elizabeth were even worse...They're pretty. That's all. Elizabeth is a hot blonde -- which was mentioned 150 times lest anyone forget. And Thibault is six feet tall, blue eyes, strong, sexy, smart, pure-minded, a gifted musician, and endlessly patient with Elizabeth's ten year-old child, to whom he is an instant father figure. Sure he is. They had no points of view. No goals. They're pretty, so they must belong together.Oh, gawd.And the ending? COP OUT. At least be man enough as an author to have your characters HAVE to make that kind of hard choice. No, instead, "it" happens off the page, and by accident. The characters are wusses. I could kick both of their asses. But it's okay, because, hey, everyone's pretty.There was a tiny light of good dialogue for maybe ten pages between Thibault and Elizabeth. I longed for more of that. Also, the dog, Zeus, was awesome. In fact, I considered giving it another star just because of the dog.Essentially, there's no CARE here. There's no skill. It's all patched together without motivations or authenticity. It's like the author himself doesn't live in the real world. Does he know people like this? It's not possible. I mean, come on!
