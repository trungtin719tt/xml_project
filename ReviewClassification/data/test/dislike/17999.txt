I loveNeil Gaiman'sSandmanso much that I am desperate to love the rest of his work, but I can't do much more than like it because it's mostly only okay.He deals with all the stuff I love -- mythology, the occult, death, dreams, the urban fantastic -- but he's too tongue-in-cheek. When I read one of his novels, I feel like I'm reading theNick Hornbyof fantasy. Too clever, too hip and too cool for his own good.It's not that I don't like his prose work. I do. And I even love some of it (likeWolves in the Walls, if that counts, andStardust), but when I get to what should be the meat of his oeuvre,American Godsand its sequel, i can't help feeling let down.It's not that I don't like his characters. Mr. Nancy, Spider and Fat Charlie are pretty groovy; the book reads fast and is entertaining; I even dig the ending, but somehow none of that is enough. I want more from Neil. I want to be dazzled, and he teases me with bedazzlement constantly, but I've only been dazzled by Dreams -- nothing else has come close.And maybe that's my problem right there: having found Gaiman through Sandman, everything that's followed pales in comparison. I am always looking for greatness, and all I get is pretty good.So if you read this review, Neil, just know that I love you, and I will always read you, and I am constantly looking for that drug-like hit I had the first time I bought a Sandman comic (and yes I am that old) and was blown away by your storytelling. You are a victim of your own best work.Please, please, please blow me away again.
