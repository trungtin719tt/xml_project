It was easier to get through Atlas Shrugged than it was to get through this monster. Yes, all the awesome stories of rape, racism, murder and genocide that you expect to find are there. Getting to them, however, takes plodding reading through pages and pages of repetitive and boring recitations of how super awesome this god guy is. At least the bible has the fun parts, in comparison to the koran, which seems to be an extraction comprised exclusively of these mind-killing passages.The second part is slightly easier to read, as it at least follows a more cohesive narrative. TheRashomonapproach to narrating the life of Jesus is interesting, though it's hard to understand where all the fanfiction gets its grounding from (and it's the fanfiction that mostly makes up our present image of the guy). There are a few quotable phrases in the second section, but again they are buried in bucket-loads of sexism and victimization. Even the more noble ideas in the book lead to questionable concepts, such as vicarious expiation, neutrality in the face of evil, intellectual irresponsibility and submission to authority.From a stylistic sense, the book has its merits, but again, they are buried in a barrage of repetitive, boring language. The arguments and narrative seem to be constructed by a 7 year old with ADHD, and the only reason the book has any linguistic significance is because it is quite old (and managed to get many things down on paper first). You will find more illuminating prose in other works from the same period.
