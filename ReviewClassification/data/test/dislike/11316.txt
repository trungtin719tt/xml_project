I tried. I really did. But this book blew it really hard. I literally skimmed over pages and pages of useless and boring things. This is the first book of the series that wasn't interesting to me. I almost gave up on it. And I think I should have. Instead I wasted 2 bucks in late fees trying to finish it. And all the characters seemed so OUT of character that I just couldn't really focus or really care about it. And you know what was really annoying? All the " I heart me some__" shit. Really annoying. I mean, why did everyone in this book just start saying this phrase? I did like the ending though. 1 boyfriend down right? I mean, seriously, how many guys can be in love with her? Maybe she really is dead and the next book will just be some even crazier random shit about Buffy killng all of them and then the humans live happily ever after. Okay, I can dream though, right? I know this is a vampire book, but can we at least be a LITTLE bit more realistic? Please? And how can she be such a 'heroine', for lack of a better word, if she keeps passing out and almost dying and really dying? I mean, not a good role model for girls who want to be strong independent women. What is this? Twilight? In the least it's a huge lame soap opera. Don't know why it took me this long to realize it. Oh, and excuse me, I'm out $2.50. 2 effin 50. And whoever can say that they liked this book, obviously doesn't know what a good, detailed book is.~T
