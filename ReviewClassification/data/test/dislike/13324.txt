GAAAAAHHHHHHHHH!!!!!! I just read the synopsis on B&amp;N's website and it sounds totally EPIC! Cannot wait!***5th most popular book this month... Alright Dashner!!!***DANG I actually did not fancy this book at all.(view spoiler)[Ugh!!!! I hate to say it but I was extremely dissapointed by the finale of The Maze Runner series, The Death Cure. It was written well like the other books but I have to say that the plot and the end were terrible. I can't even describe how dissapointed I am because I love the first two books and I had faith that James Dashner would be able to make this last one just as awesome or better, like all finales should be. Well, he has failed at doing that, in my opinion.First of all, I absolutely HATED how Teresa, whom I love so dearly and wanted Thomas to love just the same, was practically NEVER in this book. She was probably only present for a total of like 15 pages scattered throughout the book. She served almost no purpose in the book other than to cause Thomas to feel a little betrayed and to save his life in the end which any of his other friends could have done, so nothing really special on her part. She was a very promising character and she could have brought so much to this book, but it seems like Dashner just decided to throw her out because he couldn't see those possabilities. I mean, come on, you can't just throw a main character out like that! Like they were never important!This brings me to Teresa's replacement character--Brenda. Oh, dear lord, kill me already, BRENDA. UGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHH. She was so annoying to me. She brought hardly anything to the story except a little sexual appeal for Thomas, especially in the book prior to this one. Her and Thomas had absolutely NO SUBSTANCE to their relationship but kissing and hugging and flirtitious comments. There was no passion. But wait--didn't Thomas have a passionate relationship with someone in this series before...? ...Who was it with... OH!--TERESA!!!! But NOOOOOOOOO, she had to be thrown out of the picture for who knows what reason. She and Thomas could have had such a strong, passionate realationship that would grip the reader's hearts just as strongly. Honestly, why in the world would Dashner think that his readers would want Thomas to be in a shallow relationship over a strong, passionate, dramatic one?And then Dashner decides to put the cherry on top and KILL POOR TERESA!!! And he only spent half a page on it and then it was over with and Thomas hardly suffered a bit. It was in no way dramatic enough and in no way served Teresa right. I mean, a tragic hero is one thing, but just because you save someone's life doesn't mean you're the most amazing hero in the literary world. It happens all the time. But Dashner didn't make Teresa into the amazing heroine she could have been. He didn't give her a chance.In addition to the awful ways Dashner used his characters--or lack of usage thereof--I also didn't really care for the events that happened in this book. It seemed like many of them didn't push the story toward the resollution. I can't really explain that, but I just felt bored a lot. The story could have been more character-driven.The only part I rally liked in this book was Newt and his whole deal and how he ended up getting killed. It was the most emotional part of the book and it was probably the single part I wouldn't have changed.Other little things I didn't like:*How Thomas never got his memory back so we could learn exactly what he and Teresa did before the Trials.*How WICKED was neither a good guy or a bad guy. It was just a nothing that was trying to be a good guy with the best intentions but went about them in the wrong way. That is so cliched.*How we didn't get to learn more about that Paige Chancellor. I got this giddy hope near the end that she'd turn out to be Thomas's mom or something. I like surprises like that, and this book lacked them big time. While reading this I actually though of so many twists that could have happened and could have been awesome. But no, Dashner had to be un-exciting and predictable.*It seemed like there were some mini themes in this book that amounted to nothing. Like how it seemed like Thomas never wanted to become a killer, even of Cranks, but he did anyway and nothing was said about that matter after that.*What was with Newt's note? I mean, why couldn't he have just told Thomas what he wanted so there wouldn't be a problem with him knowing when to read it? I thought the note could have been more life changing and revealing about the plot or something and throughout the whole book I was thinking that woud happen but then I was so dissapointed that it didn't really affect the story at all except for Newt dying. There was pretty much no reason for the note.All in all, James Dashner not only killed off the great characters, but he killed the plot too. This story could have been amazing but all those open ends and great oportunities to really let this book shine were thrown out, left hanging. It was well written, but it was a terriblee ending to a good story. What a shame.(hide spoiler)]Yeah so I'm sooooo steaming mad that this book didn't pack the punch that it should have and easily could have had. I feel like the whole Maze Runner story was awesome but could have been told much, much better.
