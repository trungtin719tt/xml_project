Westerfield has a way of making me want to finish his books in one sitting, but I'm never sure whether that has more with his ability to build suspense or my ongoing desire to have it over with.Pretties, while not a book without merit (if I were being more fair, I would probably give it 3 stars, story-wise) irked me a great deal more thanUglies(which I obviously liked well enough to read its sequel) because of what I consider some poor authorial decisions. For a dystopia intending to critique the image-obsessed, beauty-myth-worshipping society in which we "pre-Rusties" live,Prettieshas far too much backhanded endorsement of self-destructive behavior. The Pretties intent on curing themselves of their post-surgical brain damage resort to cutting and self-starvation for the sake of improving their focus, increasing their adrenaline, and producing a "bubbly" high. I understand that this can be viewed as the "false cure" (although it seems to work well enough for Tally) intended to speak to the reason those same behaviors are used in our own (less explicit) attack on teenage brains. But I'd like to think it's not too much to ask that my anti-pretty heroine not starve herself in order to escape the (literal) clutches of society. Rethink a few of these "solutions," Scott, and I'll read another draft. If only the third book in the trilogy weren't already published. Sigh.Also... oy, with the boy drama already.
