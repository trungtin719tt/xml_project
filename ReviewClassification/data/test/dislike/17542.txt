okay to everyone who is opposed to strong language i suggest you not read this review. But i just gotta get this off my chest.Just what the FUCK does P.C Cast think she is doing? okay i was extremley happy to get my copy of awakened, and was sooooo happy when i read zoey and stark did it (i mean i have had ALOT of fantasies about that, usually with me in zoey's place), but then P.C cast is just going to ruin their relationship by adding this "totally gorgeous" vessel! I mean did she really have to make him hotter than stark? Just exactly how many hot guys are there, in this world together in one area,-none the less Oklahoma?????And i guess by her writing that little part from stark about how he dosent care that zoey is with other guys...uhhhICALLBULLSHIT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!What guy on this eath would want the gf that they are oh so serious about to be with other guys. None the less why would any guy be attracted to this whore???????????? Zoey better be pretty fuckin GORGEOUS to be causin all of this drama...And another thing... Why the fuck is heath back in the story????okay it was sad in Burned blah...blah....blah.. we cried what the fuck ever....we were depresse for a day whenever we thought about the ending of the book....BUT WE GOT OVER IT!and then youre just gonna randomly throw him back in the story!!!!and she just HAD to make him strong, and POWERFUl and a GREAT fighter!!!!NOT OK!!!!!!!!!!How about you stick with what you have and add on to Stark's strength.?!?!?! huh.? how about letting him defeat kalona/neferet?????i repeat....NOT OK!!!!!!!!!!Its fucked up!Heath better sacrifice himself in the last book or something to protect zoey, or i am going to hop inthis damn book and kill him all over again!
