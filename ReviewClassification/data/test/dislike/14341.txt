***Added Later:My summary of this book would have to be this: it is an oddly-plotted book about very stupid people written in lovely language.But oh, the idiot characters. Honestly. Why would Nell be such a twitty jerk to her fiance and adoptive family? Why on earth would Eliza act as she did? Sorry; don't buy it.-----------------------Figured out what "happened" (the mystery of the little girl on the boat) earlier on and scanned much of the rest. Didn't find the characters' behavior believable. Why would supposedly strong women (that's how the characters were drawn) do absurd things that were not in character?Nice idea with movement through generations, but . . .-Didn't believe Nell would behave as she did toward "adoptive" family--and supposedly beloved fiance--when told truth about how she came into family. Doesn't click at all.-Didn't believe Eliza would do what she did with the contingencies laid upon her--and even if she had, what's the point in staying, walled away from everyone, no contact with anyone--found this absurd. She seemed a sane and strong character up until then.-The romance tacked on for current-day character (such an uninteresting character that I can't recall her name) at end felt rather de riguer. Don't believe that, either.-Only one woman in the bunch could feel life solid and worthwhile without a man or child or both, but no one was happy even if got what they wanted or thought they wanted.Why do so many stories about women have all this jealousy and the world view that there is one pie and if one woman gets a piece (happy life) some other woman will therefore lose out? Found this annoying.Also annoyed on behalf of FHBurnette and her Secret Garden. That wasn't homage, that was a ripoff.
