This book was terrible, and I'm someone who enjoys chick lit. The Devil Wears Prada is a roman-a-clef by Lauren Weisberger, a mediocre writer who takes herself too seriously. The plot is just a series of bad decisions made by the novel's unlikeable protagonist Andy Sachs, who thinks the best way to become a writer for the New Yorker is by becoming an assistant at a Vogue style magazine for a year. Andy spends most of the novel whining about her mundane entry-level job and stealing designer clothes from the sample room. As the story unfolds, it becomes apparent that the author has a worrying lack of knowledge about fashion, publishing, and human behavior in general.Sure, it's a quick read, but there are better things you could do with your time. Like staring at the wall, or counting the dots on the ceiling.
