"I just feel I'd enjoy it more if I knew what it all meant," our narrator laments (p181). To which Conchis, the mysterious host and storyteller, replies with delight, "My dear Nicholas, man has been saying what you have just said for the last ten thousand years."Ah, culture! Here is a book carefully wrought in rich language, peppered through with plenty of French, Latin, and Greek. (keep Google Translate open while you're reading, it's not a sin!) It seems the sort of book best read in an overstuffed leather chair beside a roaring fire, perhaps with a musket or some sort of great beast's head mounted on the wall.It's cultured, yes, but suddenly racy, ribald, and surprisingly sexy. It's like Fowles has created a "blank" character for us to imprint upon, and then through quiet contemplation he lays out the depths of the human mind.The story is beautifully written but maddeningly slow, yet the reader is compelled to keep reading. It's a very welcoming sort of narration, charming and erudite and sophisticated. But it starts to drag, and drag, and drag... And the repetition keeps it locked in tedium when it's supposed to be exciting and revelatory. Eventually I stopped caring about what the next layer or twist might be and just wanted the damn thing to get to the point.Weirdly enough, I think if this book was a movie instead*, I would praise it endlessly and rank it among the top 10 cinematic experiences of all time. It's lush, and gorgeous, and descriptive and, I think above all, it's immersive. Unfortunately it does grow repetitive and slow, as our narrator does a lot of LISTENING and THINKING but very little DOING.2 stars out of 5. It's too long by half, and I had tomakemyself keep reading starting around the 300 page mark, and that's never fun.*I later found out that it was adapted into a film, but one that was widely panned and considered a big, muddled mess.
