1.5 starsThis is one of those books where almost every aspect of the book failed me. The characters were flat, the plot stalled around 40%, and the narration was unsatisfying. In fact, the only reason why I didn't just give the book one star was because the beginning intrigued me.Barrons. I don't get his appeal. This is partly because I don't particularly care for the whole "alpha male" trope since many times all it seems to be is barely disguised sexual or physical abuse against the heroine. Oh, so Barrons likes to threaten Mac or give her a good choke to get his point across? Totally cool, he's just being an Alpha Male! Catch Me! Swoon! I think not. Had this have been a YA novel, we'd all be calling this an abusive relationship. He may show a different side to himself later in the series, but I don't think I'll be able to look past book 1 to ever find him remotely attractive.Mac is probably the most annoying heroine I've read in a long time. (Maybe if I had read this circa 2009, I would have liked it better.) She's a very shallow person, who I had a really hard time relating to, understanding, or caring about. Her sister is dead and she's supposedly trying to find the murderer, but she always seemed more concerned with what color her nails were. Why is this important?The narration wasn't my favorite with Mac constantly interjecting with lines like "I won't bore you with the details..." IT WAS SO ANNOYING. I just wanted to shake her. Like, PLESAE bore me with the details because this is a, you know, BOOK. But no. Instead Moning decided that telling me every detail of Mac's outfit was somehow more relevant that describing what the fey looked like. Having Mac constantly spoil the plot time after time got so old and left no room for the element of surprise.By the time I finished the book, I feel like I know about as much about the characters and the world from when I started, which is nothing at all. Well, wait. This is what I know. As Mac would say, "I'm just paraphrasing here."- Mac likes the color pink, is fashion forward and apparently spends way too much money in the iTunes store- Barrons likes to beat his fists against his chest. He does macho things in his spare time, like running a book store. Since Mac barely describes him, this is what my brain registered him as:- the fey are evil and like to rape women because reasons- Mac's sister died by some evil guy who is not fey but also not human?? Also, his name is Lord Master (over compensating much?). I'm unsure if that's his BDSM alias or real name. Anyway, Mac's sister was hiding stuff from Mac because plot.- Mac's parents are hiding things because plot- Evil fey hang out in the part of town no one goes to because it's abandoned. Ummm, duh? Also, plot.Pretty big disappointment with this one, folks.
