Just as I predicted, I did not enjoy this.The main character is a LITERAL marshmallow and I absolutely couldn't stand her, and the plot was boring to say the least (it was also ridiculous). I've heard from many people that this book is funny, but I sure didn't think so... It wasn't even like there were jokes that I just didn't see the humor in, but rather I couldn't even understand what was SUPPOSED to be funny about it. The writing was very bland.I also listened to this on audiobook, which is the only reason I managed to get through it. I listened to it while I drove and while I was at the gym, so I had no way to escape from it. The narrator was nice to listen to at first (imagine Kat Dennings with a New Jersey accent), but her voice quickly got on my nerves. The only reason I put myself through this torture was because of a reading challenge I'm participating in, where I had to read a book published the year I was born. 1994 was not a great year for book releases.I'm just glad the book was so short so now it's over, and I never have to get inside Stephanie Plum's empty head again.
