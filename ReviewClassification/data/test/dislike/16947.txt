Wow, I am flabbergasted! Is this what people are reading in the name of 'mystery' these days? A boring book, with unpleasant and unrealistic characters and an unbelievable resolution. The protagonist is Libby Day, a woman whose family was murdered when she was a child, and she was the one who gave evidence that put her brother behind bars for these murders. Twenty four years later, when she is contacted by a murder club, which offers to pay money to her to help them investigate, she accepts the assignment. So starts a dangerous journey back into the past. An interesting premise, but very, very badly executed.First, the protagonist is not someone I was rooting for. I didn't need her to be likeable, but she wasn't just unlikeable, she was positively annoying. She is without a single redeeming feature, which would make a dark character interesting and realistic.And is she a whiner!I can't stand whiners. She makes her way through the book, consistently whining from one situation to the other. And not just her, ALL the other characters in the book are also consistently vile, nasty and caricature villains. It's like the author thinks that making people completely nasty is being realistic. It's not. Ever readA Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier? It's about a young boy in a war-torn country taking up arms, but it's not relentlessly dark. There are light moments when good things happen, and it's a TRUE story. This is where Flynn really fails in making her novel realistic.Second, I am not really a fan of graphic violence and nastiness, described in unnecessary detail. Especially, when it'sonly fiction. I mean, there are 4-5 descriptions of vomiting in the book. would people look at vomit in such detail in real life? It's hardly realistic from any point of view. The author adds scene after scene of violence and depravity merely for shock value. That's just lazy writing. There was a completely unnecessary chapter consisting almost entirely of butchering a cow. Which did not add to the plot at all. Neither did the entire Satanism angle make any sense. Though there was a panic at this time about Satanic ritual abuse,it did not really exist!The resolution takes place in two parts(view spoiler)[since there are two murderers(hide spoiler)]. One of them follows to a logical, if uninteresting, conclusion, while the other just appears out of nowhere, just tacked on for even more shock value. I am really disappointed that after wading through pages of reading about people throwing up, taking drugs and cleaning up refuse in great detail, this flimsy, unrealistic, tacky ending is what I got!And my final, but really my most important grouse, what's with Flynn and women making false allegations of sexual abuse? There is a side plot that is tacked on for no reason -(view spoiler)[a young girl makes false allegations of abuse against Ben(hide spoiler)]. Considering that she did pretty much the same withGone Girland is an incredibly popular author for some reason, it's worrying what message she is consistently sending across. With ALL the depravity and nastiness among the characters, surely it could have been arealcase of abuse? Or is the author one of those who think that 'most' cases of molestation are false? Is she a member of MRA?There are a couple of positive things. For one thing, the research is so detailed that in a different book, it would have been a real pleasure. She makes plenty of references to real murders that took place, and as someone interested in True Crime, I found that a great addition. Another is that you can see that Flynn has a talent for writing and has great ideas. Too bad, she chose to tell a boring story with uninteresting characters.I really wouldn't recommend this book, but considering it's such a huge success, maybe I am the odd one out? I certainly think it has some major concerns, and I completely call bullshit on the 'it's realistic!' viewpoint. It's not.
