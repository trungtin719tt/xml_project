Let me just say, right off the bat, that I had a love/hate relationship with this installment of Sookie's life.This one was another good read, story-wise, but it frustrated the hell out of me. We're steadily learning more and more about Sookie, and her life and love(s), and not all of those things are good.This book completely engrossed me, even while I was getting more and more upset with it. At times I felt myself winding up the old throwin' arm to chuck the damn thing at the wall, but that wouldn't have made the outcome any different, and it probably would dented the wall just to spite me, even though I'm reading a paperback.**Possible spoilers**After a heartbreaking revelation about Bill and the origin of their relationship, Sookie now feels completely betrayed and duped. She is also being ridiculously unreasonable and irrational, in my opinion. To be honest, Sookie has an annoying habit of running away from anything that upsets her. She would be much better off if she would stop making assumptions about people and their motives and just let them actually TALK to her.It is insanely frustrating to me that this story is told in first person, so we only get Sookie's lopsided and biased view of everyone around her. This is true of all books told in 1st person, of course, but this book really seems to have taken that to another level, since Sookie is being so stubbornly stupid and spiteful, even.I really think that her ability to hear other people's thoughts has made her more than a bit jaded, and so she is more than ready to see the bad in people, which leads her to just shut them down, utterly and completely.Perhaps there are people out there who will disagree with my saying these things about Sookie, and I can understand that. She is generally good, and tries to do the right thing, and I do like her, most of the time. She's gutsy and fun, smart but naive. But, when it comes to her heart, she's all-or-nothing.Bill is no saint, but I truly believe that he loves Sookie and would do anything for her. I feel for him the most, even though Sookie was hurt so badly. Bill really had no choice in any of the things that Sookie is angry with him about, and he is possibly losing her because of his role in Vampire society.Eric cares for Sookie, but in a self-serving, hey-look-at-the-cute-puppy-can-I-keep-it? kind of way. I'm not a big fan of a Sookie/Eric relationship. That's just personal preference though. I see nothing wrong with either Alcide or Quinn (yet...) so I am still rather baffled by Sookie's anger at Alcide, but I'm glad that she is being more cautious with Quinn.Maybe the next book will resolve some of these issues for me. I sure hope so.
