this. book. suuuuuuuucks.i can't believe it was an international sensation. i can't believe it was adapted into a moviestarring actual queen emily blunt. i can't believe it SOLD A SINGLE COPY. (i didn't buy this one. my mom did. so there.)this is just...a straight up bad book on every level. the characters are so insanely unlikable it's cartoonish. it'd be funny if it didn't make EVERY SECOND OF THIS BOOK, EVERY PAGE, EVERY WORD, A FRESH HELL TO FIGHT THROUGH IN ORDER TO GET TO THE NEXT ONE, WHICH IS, GUESS WHAT, ALSO HELL.this would be maybe O.K. or at least survivable if this book was scary or thrilling or spooky or intriguing at all, but guess what, IT ISN'T. just some lady getting blasted on vodka and riding a train. looking out some windows. sometimes sneaking a peek at a house.the entertainment potential is almost overwhelming.honestly all i really want from a thriller = some thrills. that really does not seem like too much to ask for, considering IT'S THE F*CKING NAME OF THE WHOLE ENTIRE GENRE. and the reveal of this makes it even worse.bottom line: straight up one of the worst books i've ever read. are there people who like this book? if so, HOW????(this is part of a project i'm doing where i write mini-reviews of books i read a long time ago. this parenthetical insert is a constant snoozefest)
