I am probably the only person in the world who HATED this book with such a white hot hate that you almost wonder if it was just the opposite. I'm reviewing it for the sake of Lorelle since it is the book that drew me into the lovely book club that I survived (or survived me) for several fun years.To sum up, I wanted to tell the main character's girlfriend (I've forgotten all of their names, mercifully), to "get over yourself!!" I'm not giving anything away when I reveal that the "pact" of the title involves her asking her boyfriend to help her commit suicide. Of course, a dramatic trial ensues. What moron couldn't have predicted that--which is another reason why I loathe this person for placing her boyfriend in unnecessary legal trouble of the Shawshank Redemption kind.It almost frightens me to realize how little sympathy I have for someone who (it is later revealed) has a somewhat plausible explanation for her dark thoughts. Yet, isn't this what therapy is for? Clearly, neither she, nor her doting parents or their enmeshed best friends' parents had an ounce of sense to recommend assistance that was not only available, but calling out from the core of their middle class existence!Obviously this passion has more to do with me than with Piccoult. However, I was asked to read one other book of hers (If you must know, It was My Sister's Keeper, and it also enraged me. But somewhat to a lesser degree because I knew what I was in for, at that point, so I accepted some of the responsibility. I will say this, come ON!! Could the ending have been MORE implausible and precious (in a bad way)?!! However, I won't give any of it away.)
