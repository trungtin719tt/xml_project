Update: 9/8/12! The "fake" review has been removed. I hate that it was bugging me so much, but I can't help but get rankled by the idea the pub or amazon or anyone other than a legit customer left a review for the purpose of selling pre-orders.BTW: After some consideration, I removed all stars from this review.Update: 9/7/12! Another "fake" 5-star customer review has been posted on Amazon for this book. It states clearly: Its sitting at a 5-star rating for pre-orders and its completely fabricated. Unbelievable!Note: when they removed the last "suspicious/fake" review, it lost alot of ground in its pre-orders. Since they put the new one on there, its been climbing. Just saying.Update 7/28/12! The questionable "customer" review on Amazon has been removed.Wow.Here's what I'm referring to: Somehow, a short, very vague "customer" review had been miraculously posted with a glowing rating for the Crossfire series declaring, "Crossfire, better than 50 Shades!", or something like that which put it at a 5-star "customer rating" over the last several weeks during their pre-order bonanza. I have to admit it did look very pretty with all its shiny stars in the top lists in the Kindle Store on Amazon.I commented to ask the "reviewer" how they were able to post a customer review for this book - no response (and I tried several times). The review/reviewer was not part of the Vine Program and I couldn't come up with any other explanation except that there was some collusion between Amazon and the dreaded publisher, Penguin, to post a manipulated 5-star review for the pre-order period.Not saying that happened, but if no outsiders have been allowed to post one, how did it get posted?Anyway, its gone now. Disappeared. Poof.Original review:Rant Warning!As many of you know, I was crazy-bonkers for the first book in this series,Bared to You, so I was allllllll excited when I saw this available for pre-order. But right away I tripped on the additional $3 over the cost of the original book and now it's gonna be $10. Ugh.So, I decided that from now on perhaps my ratings will be based on the totality of my experience with that book. That being said, my first experience is that its gonna cost more and "I didn't like that". So its receiving a 1-star rating from me. Actually, it's more of a 1.5 but since there aren't half stars...)When or if I actually receive the book, I'll add the reading experience to my overall rating. Any experiences with the author as a result of my review will also be added to my overall experience of the book and will be reflected in the rating. I am certainly not saying that I expect to have any of that occur, I am just saying that kind of thing can effect a rating. The truth is I'd probably gush in my review bc I loved the characters so much and fully expected to love this one too *sniff*.Grrrr. Don't know why it grates me so much that Penguin (Can-Suck-It)'s e-book pricing and lending policies (actually "non-lending policies" would be more accurate as disabling the lending feature of e-books is de rigueur for them) are so unsavory, but it does. Big time. It feels wrong.As far as I can tell, they arenot e-reader friendlyat alland I have decided in my own small way I'm gonna do something about it.Maybe I should be grateful its not $12 or more for the e-book, which is more their norm for a popular author even if it's for a digital, non-paper, unbound book that indie authors are popping out with practically no overhead from $.99 cents to $3.99. Publishing houses are offering them for $7.99 max and that's for popular authors. I have to really like the author to spend even that extra bit for those books.Get a clue, Penguin! It appears you're in a showdown with the e-reader readers of the world and that you assume to have the upper hand- so you're taking the stance that readers can like it or lump it. Okay then, I will lump it.Seriously? A higher price point than a paperback? Why?I can't think of any other answer beyond... opportunistic greed. This makes me want to support indie authors in abigway!What else could possibly make the next book in this series $3 more expensive than the first one. Oh right, nothing.Dear Ms. Day. Please consider becoming a self-pubbed author so we can get a better price for your lovely books and cut the big, fat, invisible overhead out of the process.*sigh*I have a bit of a temper today.I loved Gideon and Ava.I will not, however, bend to these publishing shenanigans. If I don't get my mitts on it at a reasonable price, I will wash my hands of them.
