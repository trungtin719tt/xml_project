When my mother died I was very young,And my father sold me while yet my tongueCould scarcely cry " 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!"So your chimneys I sweep &amp; in soot I sleep.There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his headThat curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said,"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare,You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair."And so he was quiet, &amp; that very night,As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight!That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, &amp; Jack,Were all of them locked up in coffins of black;And by came an Angel who had a bright key,And he opened the coffins &amp; set them all free;Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run,And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.Then naked &amp; white, all their bags left behind,They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,He'd have God for his father &amp; never want joy.And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the darkAnd got with our bags &amp; our brushes to work.Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy &amp; warm;So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm.-(The Chimney Sweeper)
