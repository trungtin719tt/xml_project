I was stunned at the lack of character description in this book. It's no wonder these novels are made so easily into screenplays. Granted, it's only the second Crichton novel I've ever read, so perhaps I should know better?The premise ofTimelinewas strangely dichotomous pro/anti-science. I'm not sure if the author is implying thatpeopleare what make innovations morally wrong, or that extreme innovations are morally wrong by themselves. This story is another instance of the low-tech scientists (in this case, Medieval archaeologists) being the heroes, and the high-tech scientists (in this case, physicists) causing the problem. This dichotomy of pro/anti-science rubs me the wrong way, as I love science of all kinds.Further rubbing me the wrong way is a scene early in the novel, where the wholesome blonde archaeologist is viewing a ruin that is full of tourists. She overhears a tour guide giving misinformation, then witnesses an enthusiastic dad (with his- of course- long-suffering child and wife) imparting information about the castle that is also incorrect. Does she step in with a smile and offer some correct information or a brief rundown of this castle? No, she watches with disdain and has thoughts along the lines of "That isobviouslythe kitchen, the hearths are even stillthere." I felt like Crichton was saying that amateur enthusiasts are fools, always wrong, and worth derision, and I was deeply insulted.The one saving grace of this novel is that Crichton has done his research. I realize good research is one of his hallmarks, but I think it's worth mentioning to any French Medieval enthusiast (if you can stomach only being anamateur).
