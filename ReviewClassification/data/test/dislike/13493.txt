I am so excited for this book to come out but there is one thing I am seriously worrying about...The Dreaded Love Triangle of Doom...with WarnerIts no secret that I completely despise Warner with every fiber of my being (a little over-dramatic but still). I am so surprised and shocked that so many people like him. I mean, I didn't know crazed psychotic war maniac was in this year but thank god I didn't get the memo.Here are the things I am praying will happen:-Adam and Juliette stay together-Adam and Juliette get it on-Adam's body is described in full detail for an entire chapter...or two-Warner tries to hit on Juliette but she still doesn't fall for him-Warner gets eaten by bears-Juliette doesn't spend half the book like almost every other ya character thinking 'but what if I got with the other guy'In the first book, Juliette said she had no feelings for Warner so I'm seriously hoping that Tahereh Mafi takes the high road and starts something new in ya: the non-love triangle. It would be really cool if Juliette didn't fall for Warner, not only cause I hate him, but because this would show readers/authors that a book doesn't need a love triangle to be amazing! Can't wait for the next book :)Update:Why is there all of a sudden 'Team Kenji'? Where did he come from? Can't a ya heroine have one guy friend that she isn't attracted to and not just because he's gay? Kenji alright but if he joins this love whatever, I might just die...Cover Alert!!! Look at that cover! XDDD
