Dnf~29%This book was on my TR shelf since forever. I loved the first one and kinda liked the other 3 books, but this is too boring. I really don't care what happens to Jason, I never liked him anyway. I'm not interested in his story-line.Maybe it's the fact that I've watched "True blood", which I liked very much (all those hot guys :D), but I can't make myself continue this series. There are many much more interesting books out there.
