A really unfortunate novel by the author of the much betterThe Disreputable History of Frankie Landau-Banks. A completely unconvincing twist in the last twenty pages resolves the mystery in a way that is both improbably gruesome and also lightly dismissed by the author.The real moral questions raised by the subject of the book, including racism, land ownership, inheritance, materialism, greed, and manipulation, are acted out in flat, white-hat/black-hat morality plays by stock characters of little or no complexity. Those questions are then answered by an intruding author's voice that patronizes the reader by declaring single answers to every moral issue raised. The same problems exist on the literary level. Interesting tools, like allegory and literary allusions, are brought into the narrative, but are then executed in a heavy-handed, amateurish way that leaves no room for the reader to respond or engage, simply enter stage right, spell out their own significance, and exit stage left. Finally, the main character, despite being the pov character in a novel of psychological recovery, is a completely empty vehicle for plot and the author's voice, with no identifiable personality or characteristics by the end of the book.The politics in the book are good. The plot is an unfortunate mismatch of borrowed material. The characters are overused stereotypes. The incorporation of sophisticated literary techniques is clumsy and embarrassing.
