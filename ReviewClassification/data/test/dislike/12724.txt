2.5 starsWHY WHY WHY did I feel the need to buy this entire series of books? Now I have to read all of them, and this is only book 2. And honestly, I read this 8 months ago and cannot remember much about it at all. But since I cannot leave books unreviewed (any time I have a book with unreviewed space, it glares at me and glares at me until I cave), I need to figure out how to review this thing. So here goes:TRUTHS ABOUT LIVING DEAD IN DALLASTruth #1:Dead Until Darkis better.I did not love Harris' first installment of the Sookie Stackhouse mysteries, but it was better than this one. I read that one years ago and still remember it more than I remember what happened in this one. And I think that says more than words can, doesn't it? The mystery plot of the first one was better and more interesting. It had that home town Bon Temps feel to it. Plus it had more Sam.And Lafayette was still alive.Truth #2: The TV show is better.Not only is there some amazing eye candy in the TV show, the writing is better, the plot is tighter, and the characters are not only less contrived, they are really intricate, detailed, dynamic, interesting, and loads of fun. Not only did the show make the decision to keep Lafayette alive, but they turned him into one of my favorite television characters ever. Godric/Godfrey, another favorite character on the show, was lackluster and dull in this installment. Even the vampires were stupid. The second season of the show is actually my favorite. Because that whole maenad/Marianne plotline was SO. WELL. DONE. It was NOT in this. We meet Tara in this installment, as well as Eggs. But if you are expecting Tara and Eggs from the show you will be sorely disappointed. It is almost as if the creators of the show thought to themselves "hey, this series may be hokey and contrived, but lets revamp it a bit and make it shine." And that's exactly what it looks like. Characters in the book are stripped down to their cores and made way more interesting. Plotlines are flipped upside down and reanimated. While reading this, I was definitely reminded of the show, but in a bare bones kinda way. The book just seemed boring and shallow in comparison. Even the whole Fellowship of the Sun plotline was so much better in the show with the addition of Jason (who has next to no real-estate in either book). In this it just seemed stupid and contrived.Truth #3: I still don't get the whole "Eric Northman is hot" thing.Sorry Shelly and my other Viking acolytes. I think he's a dick. There's nothing sexy about him in this book. Alexander makes himkindaenticing on the show, but when you compare thiswith thisThe wolf is going to win in my book. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.Truth #4: Sookie still sucks.Oh god could we get a more horrible heroine? Maybe that's ultimately why I don't like this series. You'resupposedto care about the heroine and hope she doesn't die. I found myself not caring. Because she is a shallow, dumb, self-absorbed, and utterly clueless speshul snowflake. In fact, I don't think I've ever met a snowflake more fucking speshul than Sookie fucking Stackhouse.Truth #5: I still hate Sookie and Bill.Like so much. Their sex scenes suck and are completely robotic. So I can't even get into the smexy times of this book. Confession: I actually enjoyed Bill on the show. I actually enjoyed Sookie and Bill on the show. Because Anna Paquin and Stephen Moyer did a great job of making their characters likeable. And they had some really steamy chemistry (they are married after all) that made me get behind them as a couple. But Bill in the book? Yawn. Sookie in the book? Rage. Sookie and Bill in the book: Eye roll. Maybe that part will be better in subsequent books since I know they break up in book 3. And though I know she eventually gets with the second most boring character, Mr. Eric Northman, perhaps their sex scenes will be hotter. Maybe? I mean, Sookie will pretty much fuck anything with fangs, right?Yes, Miss Stackhouse. Yes I do.I gave this a 2.5 for the simple fact that its readable. I breezed through it quickly, and though there isn't anything to make my gears turn, there are some fun parts. I'll read book 3 eventually because I own it. And I enjoyed Russell Edgington and Sophie-Anne immensely.And of course, my homegirl Jessica.And the wolf himself.
