I'm done.No more.Not interested. Thank you very much.I am once again, the minority here among all my other goodreads friends.So why don't I like this book?These are my answers:1) The whole book isBORING!!!The only action that I read about is when they got jumped and that's it.2) Sydney - IRRITATING as hell. There is only one Rose Hathaway. She is no heroine. No fighter. And she is annoying. The "intellectual" talk with the so called "date"?3) Jill - seriously?Just get killed already. People are trying to protect her but no...she wants to be featured on magazines. Thinking about love and oh.. she's just useless in this book.4) Angeline - a joke. Another rose wannabe? With the clothes, the rashness?NO!5) Eddie -whatever you are there for. I don't know.6) Adrian - what in the world has happened to you?I am heart broken. My Adrian is no more. Goodbye. Pair off with whoever you want. If I miss you, I will read the VA series but not these.7) The whatever love triangles that will be happening there from book 3 onwards. The denial. The wrongs of being together and etc etc.W-H-A-T-E-V-E-R!SO, I am done.4 more books to go? NO WAY!I will always love Richelle Mead's work but not this spin off.No.
