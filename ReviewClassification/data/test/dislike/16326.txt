Warning, this is a rant..Sometimes a writer thinks that he's flowing with genius and ideas, and that merely basing a story on a real life event would create a masterpiece. well, i thinks it's time they stopped doing it and people stopped canonizing unworthy so-called writers.this is the second book of Coelho that i've read and it hadn't fail me in disappointment. Obviously, from his afterword, it's evident he's thinking he's doing something earth-shattering and ground-breaking by writing about sex and prostitution.... but you know what dude? Marquis de Sade had written about it wayyyyy before you were conceived and it's called libertine literature. and he had the bravery to portray it as real as it was, and not put on a spiritual spin on it as you did.this book was a complete waste of time and i should have dropped it but i didn't want to add one more to my rising pile, so i bit down my anger and finished it.the fact that he wrote it as if he was a woman and he could understand women angered me beyond my limit. there's no realism in this book whatsoever, like no mention of a week off cuz of monthly period.it was a basic trope, falling in love with a prostitute, as Shakespeare did, and so many other unfortunate men, and the story of the whore's redemption and regaining her "light".what a load of crap!i should have put this book down when i saw it was opening with scripture. -____-
