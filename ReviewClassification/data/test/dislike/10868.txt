C.S. Lewisand I are never going to see eye to eye. First, because I've yet to feel any desire to participate in a seance, and second, I prefer my manipulative (religious) propaganda to be much more subtle in nature.And yet, despite all the above, I can't help but keep coming back to these books. What can I say? The appeal of a magical world in a wardrobe is irresistible. Yes, Iknooooowit's not actually inside the wardrobe, yadda yadda yadda...I loved reading about the latest developments in Narnia. I enjoyed riding owls alongside Jill, I giggled at Puddleglum's idea of pep-talk, especially when taking into account that he was considered to be rather upbeat by his kind:"Good morning, Guests," he said. "Though when I say good I don't mean it won't probably turn to rain or it might he snow, or fog, or thunder. You didn't get any sleep, I dare say."Yes we did, though," said Jill. "We had a lovely night.""Ah," said the Marsh-wiggle, shaking his head. "I see you're making the best of a bad job. That's right. You've been well brought up, you have. You've learned to put a good face on things."... and most of all, I enjoyed accompanying our three heroes on their quest, looking forward to the new lands they'd discover.So 2 stars for the awesome world building aspect and Puddleglum's (unintended) pep-talk through reverse psychology.If there was ever a story suffering of a "show, don't tell" deficiency, this was it. I can't remember asingle instancewhere our characters weren't explicitlytoldimportant things. I generally don't muchcareabout the manner a hero finds his clues, but this was excessive.And last, but most definitelynot least, what is UP with the epilogue?! Admittedly this is not the only book wherein Narnia and thereal worldintertwine, butThe Magician's Nephewdid it much better. In here it seems more like an afterthought; perhaps a bonus for a job well done.Score: 2/5 starsI took up reading this book with the lowest possible expectations. I was expecting religious propaganda, poorly veiled Christian morality and the obligatory black and white world-view. On the one hand, the latter should not come as a surprise given the target audience. On the other hand, the overly simplified morality made it difficult for me to take any character/development seriously.That said, I'm looking forward to the movie, and the portrayal of the different lands and people that the heroes encounter. Just please drop the epilogue.==========================================Review of book 3:The Voyage of the Dawn Treader
