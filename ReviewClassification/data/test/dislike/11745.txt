Fuckingterrible.An immortality fable thoroughly leavened with pseudo-spiritual bullshit, goofball names (Bingo Pajama! Huxley Anne and Wiggs Dannyboy! V'lu Jackson! The Bandaloops!), nonsensical descriptions ('Above Seattle, the many-buttocked sky continued to grind', 'The shaman grinned like a weasel running errands for the moon'), a black character dat sho 'nuff be talkin' like dis, and a yucky, hairy, hornballlesbian- Careful, Priscilla - she's going to corner you and eat your pussy!At one point, thisactually happens.Worth reading - now I know not to read anything else:1. Written by Tom Robbins2. Recommended to me by the person who told me I should read Tom Robbins.
