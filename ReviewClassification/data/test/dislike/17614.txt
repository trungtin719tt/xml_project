I read this book because my partner and I have an agreement. We both love wildly different styles of books, so we each choose one of our favourites and make the other person read it. This was her choice (I made her read A game of thrones in case you're wondering).I hated this book for it's subject matter and content. The damn thing ended just when it started getting interesting and glossed over anything that was actually worth finding out more about. (roughly the last third was fantastic, but she skipped over so many things that by the end I was more than a little disappointed.)I didn't give a damn about any of the characters, couldn't identify with the setting and felt like the last third of the book, with it's incredibly different tone, would have better stood as it's own book.That being said I love the author's turn of phrase. This for me is the literary equivalent of listening to someone with a beautiful voice read the phone book. The content is meaningless but damn it sounds good.
