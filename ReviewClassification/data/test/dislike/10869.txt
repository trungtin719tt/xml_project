The 6th book in the Chronicles of Narnia, Eustace from The Voyage of the Dawn Treader is back and this time he brings along a schoolmate, Jill Pole to adventure in Narnia. I always had the impression that this particular book was scary or the darkest of the series. Blame it on the BBC series that I saw on YTV as a kid.I thought the Queen was going to be as dark and mean as the one from The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. However, I felt it was a bit boring.
