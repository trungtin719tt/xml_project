A Bend in the Road is not the story to take with you on a road trip. The books tells the story of Mile's Ryan's life after the death of his wife Missy Ryan. Not surprisingly the story becomes a love story when Deputy Ryan meets and falls in love with his sons' second grade teacher Sarah. It turns out that Sarah is heartbroken too and the two hit it off after Miles sweeps her off her feet with his superb elegance (not). Nothing seems to threaten their relationship until (dun dun dun) new information about Missy's hit and run killer resurfaces.What really bothered me about this book was the utter predictability! Miles became a complete monster after he started to focus on the case once more and I half-thought that Sarah would end up breaking up with him because he threatened to be violent. Of course she stood by him because this is after a Nicholas Sparks novel filled to the brim with steadfast true love. The book had that "expect the unexpected" quality which didn't quite work out. Because of the lack of characters you can have the "killer" pegged almost right off the bat.It bothers me that so many of Nicholas Spark's books are set in this "small town" of New Bern. If it's such a small town do all the characters know each other? I just wish there would be a change of setting.Finally everything about this novel is soooo cliche! Looking at the dialogue I sometimes think "does anybody even talk like this?".There's no denying however that there is some good in this book. The plot twist in A Bend in the Road was excellent! I didn't even see it coming!
