I don't know how to rate this book so therefore I'm not going to. I can say that it is very well written. The author is incredibly talented. To draw such emotion through an extremely taboo topic takes pure talent. I couldn't do it because I'm just not that good. The children in this story have such a sad but unfortunately real situation. The fact the two eldest of the five kids fall in love does bother me. I couldn't accept it. BUT that doesn't mean it wasn't a heart wrenching story. If you like tear jerkers then this is the book for you.
