I made it through this book, though I didn't want to. I'm too exasperated to write a nice, well thought-out review. I think I'm just going to throw together some thoughts and see where it goes.For all the hype with this book, I honestly expected greatness. The majority of my GR friends like this one so I thought it might be a good read.It wasn't.If we get past the terrible first person present tense writing, the book is still a boring, amateurish effort.Let's start at the very beginning. After I encountered this quote near the start of this book, I knew it would be a tough read for me.Instead of sitting around dreaming up new sex positions, as Natalie often does about Damon, I dream about things that really matter. What the air in other countries feels like on my skin, how the ocean smells, why the sound of rain makes me gasp.Oh shut your face you self-rightous, arrogant ninny. "Why the sound of rain makes me gasp"??? WTF! You must be fun to hang out with in a storm. "Gasp, gasp, gasp"... And I'll have you know, plenty of my most important thoughts involve new sexual positions. Far more important than what the air feels like in Germany or Chile. (I'll give you a hint... it feels like AIR).Okay, I'm taking a breather. I had a ranty little moment there.On top of a main character that bothered the ever-living crap out of me, I decided to continue on the hopes that this book became great. It didn't. The first 1/2 was impossibly dull. I actually yawned while reading it. And the writing... just super repetitive, simple, anti-engaging stuff. However, as I read on, I kind of found myself being drawn into the story a bit. I started to enjoy myself a fraction and I caught glimpses of what all the hype was about.Then the ending.Melodrama, melodrama, melodrama with a big helping of emotional manipulation.Sigh.So I didn't HATE, hate this one. But I certainly didn't love it. It came nowhere near to living up to the hype.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review****Find this review and others like it at myfictionnook.com**
