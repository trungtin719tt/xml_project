My First read in English, I don't Know If the Novel is actually Bad or The Translate.Every event here was boring, expected, and sometimes provocative. The only thing I was fond of is Mr. Phileas Fogg Character Especially its coolness and permanent stability. On the other side, the other characters were very ordinary.Anyway, I liked this different kind of reading, even if the first experience was bad.
