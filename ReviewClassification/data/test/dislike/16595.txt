Reading crime #5000 for the month of January.I saw the movie first.I loved the movie.This is the first time I have read this book.I didn't like the book.Before I begin I should say some nice words. While reading this book, I kept picturing the actors/actresses from the movie. It was like re-watching the movie again but in my head. I'd rather watch the movie - it was less painful.The Devil Wears Pradawas not a perfect book. It really wasn't. It was beyond terrible. It had so many flaws that I don't really want to talk about them. HA! just kidding - here come the flaws people!Step one: When readingThe Devil Wears PradaI suggest you have a bottle of wine somewhere near you. If you are of drinking age, open the god damn bottle and pour yourself an "Alaina Pour."For example:Step two: Take a huge sip when any character annoys you.For example, Andrea/Andy annoyed me every time she talked. I just couldn't like her. Not even wine could make me like her. This whole not liking her made me so sad because I liked her character a hell of a lot more in the movie but that's probably due to the amazing Anne Hathaway.Step three: Skim through the boring parts. HA - just kidding! Don't do that. Suffer instead. Enjoy Andy whining throughout the entire book. The entire time I was reading this book, I was whining about her whining and how I would rather participate in a star wars movie marathon.SPOILER:I don't like any of the Star Wars movies. I didn't see the one that came out in December 2017 with my family and I'm pretty sure I slept during the movie before that. IN THE MOVIE THEATER. I have no regrets - best nap of my life!PS. Sorry to all the Star Wars lovers. I tried to get into them but yeah.. I can't. More for you?Anyways, I'm kind of sad that I read it but I'm also happy at the same time because I still haven't DNF'd a book and I got one more book off of my TBR list.Step four: If you see this book.. walk away. NO - RUN FOR YOUR LIFE AND DON'T LOOK BACK EVER.
