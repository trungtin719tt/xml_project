Sometimes I wish that negative stars were allowed...this book deserves the Anti-Star. I wanted to read this book because everyone I knew had read it and love it and wept over it. "The greatest love story of all time." blah blah blah.~~Spoiler Alert~~I have a serious pet peeve. A love story does NOT involve adultery. (Period!with a capital P) I have also started to question anyone who thinks that a "great" love story can only happen if you cheat on your spouse, or steal another persons spouse or any combination of the above.And it is further insulting that the adulteress kids are intrigued that their mother had a relationship with someone OTHER than their father and thinks it would be FUN or interesting to discover more about it.I just don't understand it.
