My boyfriend gave me this, and it had me on the floor laughing. I never actually read any of it past the cover blurb, but the idea of a nefarious new age plot to enslave the world struck me as hilarious, considering the things I knew about Wicca from my adolescent 'I wanna be a witch' phase. It involves a lot of gardening and smelly candles, from what I remember. Watching lunar cycles, I guess. 'Dancing about without your drawers on', as Pratchett's Granny Weatherwax says. Even now, I'm having trouble coming up with a dastardly plot involving these actions. The closest I can get is public indecency.Perhaps Buddhism is a bigger den of evil, though if you're like Tofu Roshi, the hyperoxygenation caused by endless deep breaths in meditation would leave you unable to tie your own shoelaces, much less stage an evil world takeover. Best to stick with tending the compost.Ah! Compost! Of course! The common denominator of all those terrible new age religions. Possibly the Eastern ones too, though I'm not terribly familiar with them, beyond the great Tofu Roshi. I'm sure some awful plot involving compost is the answer.Perhaps the Terrible New Agers (inc.) planned to hoard all the world's compost, leaving the Good People without fertilizer unless they left the True Path. Shame this doesn't take the nitrogen based stuff common today into account, but I'll just pretend the New Agers didn't know about it, since they're uneducated hippies. Then the Devout Hero saves the day by bringing chemical fertilizer to the small farms held in the evil clutches of the Terrible New Agers, thus ending their dependence on compost and ruining the Terrible New Agers Dastardly Plot.Am I close? No?Well, drat.
