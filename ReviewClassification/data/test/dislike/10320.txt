*SPOILERS*Sadly, I think I've reached the end of my patience with this series. It started out wonderfully, and I will always consider the first,Outlander, to be one of my favorite books of all time. Unfortunately, Gabaldon just couldn't seem to keep her mojo working. At least, not for me. I endured the second book, with all its tedious details and snore-inducing battle descriptions and melodrama. I even accepted the third...even after being completely incensed and on the verge of tears when I realized Claire and Jamie were separated for twenty years.Seriously.Twenty. Years.I'm not sure I can ever forgive Gabaldon for that. But I trudged on, hoping somewhere along the way I'd be able to tuck away my disappointment and lose myself in the story again.But no. This, the fourth book in the series, has completely deadened me to any enjoyment I once took from this fictional world. I don't really know what Gabaldon's intentions were. I find myself wondering if she even had solid plans for where this story would go when she began writing about Claire and Jamie. It doesn't seem like she did because when you read it through, the Claire and Jamie in book four seem like completely different people from the other three books. I know perhaps some people chalk it up to character development, and I understand that characters change. The thing is, characters are supposed to evolve. They're not supposed to behave in an entirely different manner than the reader is used to. Gone are the intelligent, canny, funny, bold characters from the first three books. Jamie Fraser was always a man to contend with. Always one step ahead of everyone else. He always knew what was going on and why and had a plan in place to make things go his way. In this book, however, he appears to just be stumbling along like an imbecile. Claire is timid and outraged in turns, but her reactions never appear to fit in any coherent sense. She's timid when she should be bold, and outraged when she should maybe let something go. It's almost incomprehensible how much I suddenly disliked her.And their daughter? Brianna?Gods save me from ever having to read about her again. What an idiot.My biggest issue with this book is not the fact that the characters were altogether different, it was the fact that they were altogetherstupid. And this is one of those stories that hinges entirely on the Big Misunderstanding. No one is communicating with anyone else, and this of course leads to trouble, which leads to more trouble and more trouble and more trouble since apparentlyno onecan be bothered to tell anyone else what the hell is going on.If Brianna needed Roger to stay behind so she could get back, she should havetold him.Roger should have planned his departure a bit better.Why did Brianna scream in terror when she saw Roger in the pub? First she was dreamy, then she was screeching. Didn't make much sense.Why did Roger leave her alone? After his internal fury over how naive she was being about her safety, he leaves her alone again! And what does the simpleton do? The little brain trust waltzes into the cabin of an 18th century pirate and gets raped.When they're waiting for Roger to show up on the mountain, they keep referring to him as Roger Wakefield, despite the fact that Brianna knows he's going by Mackenzie....So he gets his ass handed to him by Jamie and sold to the Iroquois as a slave because Jamie can't be bothered to ask him his first fucking name.I just can't with this book. I'm deeply disappointed and saddened at how badly things were handled, and I just can't bring myself to read any more of it. Especially considering the next book is nearly 500 pages longer than this one.This was me while I was reading the book:This was me when I was finished:
