I mean, its interesting how he sets up his plots with time : Characters use light speed to bump around, and while for people on planets time ages 50 years, the people on the ship don't age more then a couple of days. THIS I like.But I'm sick of his subtle racism; I'm a bit sick of how Card pretends to be able to view people like an open book - his characters can PREDICT exactly how other characters will act, due to their personality type etc.And we'll see if the plot has a pay-off, Its just a bit mediocre.PS: And I'm sick of his vapid discussions on "religion" - where he constantly brings up "calvinism," "catholicism," "mormonism," and his own goofy agnostic space thing : its a bit preachy at times.And his use of Portuguese to help individualize his focus planet in here : something called Luscitania : is more funny then interesting.PPS: Oh and one more thing. The names he picks for 'entire alien species' - seem like straight out of a 10 year olds pokemon imagination: "buggers" - this name is used for 1000s of years SERIOUSLY to describe an insect like species that is intelligent etc: and "piggies" for another talking species on Luscitania. Fucking ridiculous. Amen.
