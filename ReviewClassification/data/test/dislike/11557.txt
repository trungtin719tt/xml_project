Hmm, so there's a girl whose name is a colour (Violet) and a boy whose name makes him sound like he burst from the pages of a Dickens' novel (Theodore Finch) and they're both super quirky, intelligent and know the names of a bunch of dead poets. Then there's that whole death thing hanging over this novel...why does it feel like I've read this before?Err...Oh, right.Okay... so don't you just hate it when reviewers try to tell you what you should or shouldn't read? And they make universal statements like "who could possibly love a book like this?" Yeah, me too. Which is why I'm not going totellyou to do anything; but I am going tostrongly recommendthat you consider readingForgive Me, Leonard Peacockinstead of this book. Because the theme is the same, only I believe it to be so so much better.Perhaps it's just me, but I am getting so tired of these Lifetime special kind of books that seem to hit me over the head with emotional manipulation.John Green, of course, created his own set of quirky characters to make a humorous book about cancer, and now we've reached the same for suicide.If you did happen to loveThe Fault in Our Starsand other books like it, don't let me keep you from snapping this book up - it probably will become a new favourite. But it just did not work for me.These characters all feel so fake; like plot tools the author uses to extract our emotions.From the very first page, I felt like the book took centre stage and introduced itself as: "I am a book about suicide. Cry, bitches!"I knew how this was going to end; I just knew it. Not even any surprises. Apparently, it's some flaw in my character for not lovingAll the Bright Placesbecause these books constantly claim commercial and critical success. I should be drowning in my own tears and mucus right now. Oh well, sucks.And honestly... Augustus Waters and Theodore Finch? Please. What century am I in?Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr
