While Faulkner is a beautiful writer he is very depressing. I lost interest after 100 plus pages, so I really can't even say that I read the book. What did me in was his flashbacks. It was okay for one chapter, but chapter after chapter revealed flashbacks, and this during the time when I found the book so interesting. My thought was to skip them and get on with the book, but so many chapters were on it. I will keep the book and keep trying.P.S. I gave in and finished the book. It never got beyond boring and was so full of violence that I could hardly stand it.I remember trying to read, As I Lay Dying, and quit because it was a downer. I don't expect to ever read another Faulkner book, but at least I can say I did.
