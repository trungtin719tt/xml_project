Gray starts out luring readers into believing they are reading a Twilight replica: the bronze-haired boy with chiseled features (yes, she uses the word the words bronze and chiseled) who is way too fast to be normal and such uncanny perception that maybe he can read minds. Then there's the unpretty, unsure-of-herself girl protagonist with her copy of Wuthering Heights that is shy and out of place in her new school and confused about these strange students who don't seem to eat and are way too beautiful to be be normal. All she wants is to date this guy that is her whole world but he thinks she should stay away from him because something isn't normal about him.Thenhalfwaythrough the novel, Gray throws in this twist that basically means the entire book up until that point is a lie. Sure plot twists are good, but to do so by deceiving your audience is not good. If we're going to see Bianca's world through her eyes, we have to trust that we're seeing the world she sees. It made Bianca an untrustworthy point of view and I almost quit reading. Theonlyreason I didn't stop was because I like to scour ya fiction and tear it apart to see what makes it tick.After Gray lost my trust, I found her main character too unreliable and inconsistent to grasp anymore. Later in the book there is another plot twist that didn't perturb me as much since it wasn't the protagonist who was lying, but in light of the first twist it still annoyed me. I don't like being manipulated as a reader. Gray should have spent her time explaining her folklore that she left too holed and unbelievable in an effort to take us on a suspenseful ride when the story could have carried the book instead of tricks. Besides it was cheesy without substance. Unless you are into the vampire genre, I'd skip this one.
