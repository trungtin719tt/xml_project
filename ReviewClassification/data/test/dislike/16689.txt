DNF at 60%One star for Manon Blackbeak.Welp. I tried.Full review to come.____________________________________________*Edit:So my opinion on this series has changed after re-reading QoS, so I don't exactly consider myself a ToG fan anymore, but I still stand by what I said in this review.*Edit:I feel like I should clarify that I am not talking about sassy or sarcastic reviews, because I have written a few myself, and I find those reviews absolutely hilarious, regardless of if I liked the book or not. I am only talking aboutboth sides of the argumenttaking things unnecessarily far.Disclaimer: This is my opinion on the Throne of Glass series and the controversial thoughts surrounding it. I am in no way trying to force my opinion on you if you like or dislike this series. It is perfectly okay to like and dislike different things, but bashing someone else for disagreeing with your opinion on something as trivial as a book series, whether your opinion is a positive or negative one, isneverokay, and this goes for both sides of the argument. It is not my intention to start a complete shitstorm in the comment section. Opinions are great things, so please, try to treat everyone with the respect they deserve.I have many friends here on Goodreads that have a difference in opinion on some of my favourite books,and we get along just fine, because werespectthe other person and their feelings towards whatever book we disagree on. Opinions arenotfacts.Your opinion on this series, or any series, is not right or wrong. It just is.I will say this once, twice, however many times I need to so I can get this out there:Just because you dislike a book series does not, under any circumstances, give you permission to send the author death threats.Authors are real people with feelings like the rest of us. The author is not forcing you to read their books. It is up to you, andonly you,to decide whether or not you want to continue reading this series.I have only heard of people doing this, I have not seen any myself, and I do not have proof, so I could be wrong. Do not take my word for this. Whether these allegations are true or not, I cannot say. The point I am trying to make is that threats to authors, or anyone, in general, are still unacceptable.Read whatever you want to, friends. Just respect other's opinions while doing so, please.
