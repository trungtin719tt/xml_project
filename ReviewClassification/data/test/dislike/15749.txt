I'm glad I didn't pay for this book. Our apartment building has a bookcase in front of the elevator, and someone in the building must be a Grisham fan, because I've picked up several of his books from the communal bookcase. This is the worst of the Grishams that I've read.What annoyed me the most was the sheer implausibility of the whole story. The civil tobacco trial itself was plausible enough, but the jury foreman protagonist and his accomplice on the outside have a plan to influence the trial (via the jury verdict) that is so ridiculously far-fetched that it's impossible for anyone with common sense to buy into the idea that this could succeed. Without giving anything away, they've been hopping from tobacco trial to tobacco trial (in other states where big tobacco trials have been scheduled previously), changing names, registering to vote in each new state, and *miraculously* getting called for jury duty right when the big tobacco case was happening, and *miraculously* getting called to be in the jury pool for that particular trial (as opposed to the myriad other civil and criminal trials happening on the same day that also need jurors), only to fall just short of getting seated on a jury -- until this case, when they finally manage to get the protagonist on the jury and put their master scheme into action. The whole plot just unacceptably begs belief, and I lost patience with it rather quickly.After about the 1/3 point, I was just reading to see how it ended, not because I cared about any of the characters or the outcome of the trial, but just to get answers to the protagonists' true intentions and motivations, which you don't learn until the very end. I think this is why it was such a frustrating book for me. I would prefer to have someone to root for in a book, and when you are not privy to the motivations or goals of the main character (when, in essence, you have no idea whether he's a decent guy or a selfish jerk) you can't feel invested in that character or the story.
