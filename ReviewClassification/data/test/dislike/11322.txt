This book was crap, just like the rest of the series. It was a watery filler unworthy of my time. I'll break down some of my biggest problems with the series as of now.Damien and Jack -- they aren't a real gay couple. The Cast's have twisted them so outside of real people that it makes me cringe whenever I read them. Instead of being a real couple, they've become a cute puppy sideshow. It seems like they're constantly patting themselves on the back for having a gay couple without having to add things like emotions and problems, you know, the things the straight couples have to deal with.Kramisha -- Oh my uck-fay. WHY?! I can't remember much about this book because reading it felt like sitting in the middle of a lake, treading water, but I feel the need to mention the ever racist Kramisha. She is the stereotypical black 'guurl' right down to the name. Kramisha? REALLY? Are you stupid or just racist? You'd think that a student at a school that's so fantastic would be able to make her literate! But no. She's black so she's dumb, right?The Twins -- How many times do you have to point out that one of the girls are black and the other white? It's annoying. Seriously annoying. I feel like their characters have deteriorated over the series. They've turned into shallow harlots who live to shop and go goo-goo for boys. Together they are sort of rich, love to shop, and hate Aphrodite. But what are they on their own? Well, they're from different sides of the country, and they don't have the same color of skin... And nothing else. Does no one else feel like the whole Twin's thing was just a way to keep from having to form two different characters?There is so much more wrong, but I need to stop before I get angry, but there is a lot more I can't stand about this book.In the end, this book sucked, the characters sucked, and I'm not spending any more on the next series.
