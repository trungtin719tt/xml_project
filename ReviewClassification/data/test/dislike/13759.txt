Casual sexism, homophobia, ableism, racism, rape that is apparently ok, even hiring a molester because why the fuck not? Reducing women to bitches with tits at times, fuck everything else.Is there good in this book? Sure. At times I loved Forrest's POV and it has some little gems here and there, a good message or two. But mostly all I found was garbage that didn't need to be in the story, it served no purpose. I'd find myself liking something only to then see some unnessary crap and be taken right out of the story, again and again. And oh..fuck that ending.Fuck. This. Book. I am so done.I will watch the movie seeing as talking about it with my hubby it sounds like the crap I had issues with in this book aren't in the movie, like the are very different. I don't know yet (i'll come back and update after i've seen the movie) but it sounds like the movie will be better.Update: I'VE WATCHED THE MOVIE...AND IT WAS AWESOME. Sorry for the screaming. It took out all the bullshit (quite a feat!) and turned some things around that desperately needed to be and just made it awesome and mean so much!! *Squeals with happiness and sadness because it's a sad movie but it's sooo good!*Whoever turned this trash-fire of a book into such an amazing movie is a freaking genius!...that is all
