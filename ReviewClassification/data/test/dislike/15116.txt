This is going to be a comprehensive review for my thoughts on the 13 books and novellas that I've read in the series up to this point, so this review could be on the long side. Since I spent the past couple of weeks plowing through several of these books, I wanted to get some of my thoughts down on the series as a whole (so far) instead of writing out long reviews for each book, especially since many of my thoughts overlap from book-to-book. I might get up some mini-reviews/notes on the other books soon, but I won't take the same amount of time on those to only repeat the same thoughts over and over, and will instead dump the lot of it here.Side note : I did readNight Pleasures(technically, the first official Dark Hunter book) years ago, and was so unimpressed that I didn't come back to this series until now.Okay, so...I don't like this overlapping series garbage. I tried to follow the (entire) Dark Hunterverse list, but I still feel like I'm missing something. Dark-Hunters, Dream-Hunters, Were-Hunters, other gods, etc. The only people I feel invested in are the Dark Hunters. Their world makes the most sense to me. The characters are the ones thatshouldread as the driving force of the series, with Ash at the helm, but I keep getting pulled into these side stories that take me out of the Dark Hunter core world.Let's start with the book that this review sits on :Fantasy Lover. Julian is not a Dark Hunter. He just happens to know them. Julian's story doesn't even really tie in to the DH world as well as it could have. These early books in the series read sillier and fluffier than the some of the other books. I will probably chalk it up to the author still needing to find her footing with the world she created. You could tell that she was drawing on old school romance writing to start, when phrases likeHe could have raped her at any timecrop up, as if someone NOT raping a person is a basis for what makes them good. It also doesn't help that some of the expressions and exclamations from the characters are painfully cheesy in these first few books (calling men Buster and describing them as bodacious), and that the music references feel extremely dated. The series flow was still too rocky for longer than it needed to be though.It took me a good 6 or so books before I reallywantedto keep going. I almost quit out a few times but Ash and Simi kept me hanging on. The complexities of the character Ash made me curious to see where his story would go.As I continued on into the series (or multiverse), I kept thinking that the books books were never any better than 2 to 3 stars. It probably wasn't until I got to Tabby's book (6) that I found myself really starting to care about the characters and world as a whole (although I did really like some parts of the previous couple of books). I finally started to look forward to a future character's book......and then Wren's book pissed me off. I realized right there and then that the Were-Hunter side of the world was not crafted as well as the Dark Hunter side.From my notes onDragonswan(the prequel novella) :Their (the Were-Hunter) story doesn't read all that cohesive with the Dark Hunter world. Dark Hunters have limitations on their powers and can't just do whatever they want, whenever they want, but weres get to bend and shape time and the world around them, even though they are not nearly as evolved as Dark Hunters are. Disappearing clothes? Really??? Teleporting with no real need (i.e. for their own wants and not because they could use it for fighting like the DH would) Time jumping all over the place with no huge Butterfly Effect? Yeah...I don't like it.That sums up how I felt about Wren's book (I wanted to love Wren's book so much and I just couldn't). Time travel solves everything and nothing at the same time. Weres can go into the past but can't rearrange too much or the Fates will get pissy at them. Well what a stupid ability. It's useless and overpowered all at the same time.I found myself continually getting frustrated with Kenyon's world. Minor tweaks and changes happen to the rules all of the time. Inconsistencies pop up from out of nowhere, making me wonder if the author even remembers her own rules at times. Immortality is thrown around like it's no big deal. I want to give this author credit for creating a world which has obviously been "borrowed" from by many other authors (many of the newer popular PNR series have characters and elements which mirror DH concepts). The woman had her creativity game in place when she came up with the Dark Hunterverse. I had no idea until now just how much her writing has influenced series like BDB and IAD (and others). It makes me sort of sad that I like both of those series so much better. Both J.R. Ward and Kresley Cole have a better handle on how to tie their characters and story lines together into one intertwining arc. In addition, Cole is one of the few authors I've found who has been able to incorporate multiple races and lore into one continuous story without messing up the flow.I have the feeling that the series will improve the further that I go. This was how the Midnight Breed series worked for me. MB had a very rocky start, and it took several books for the world to come together. But when itfinallydid, I ended up really liking the series. It just took me a longer than I wanted to get to that point.So I will keep going. I'm invested in Ash, Simi, and Nick. I want to know more about future Marissa. I want to see how the guy on the beach with Nick (ffs, I can't remember his name) is going to fit into the story.So the first few dates were awkward. It doesn't mean that this slow burn won't turn into love. I feel like I owe it to one of the OG PNR series to see where it takes me.
