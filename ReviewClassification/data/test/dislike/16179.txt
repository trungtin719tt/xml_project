In spite of the moderately engaging beginning,Dead Witch Walkingfinally lost me by about page 100. Unfortunately, no more Rachel Morgan for me.On the bright side, there is a potential in this series. I recently abandoned a couple of UF series because of the barenness of their worlds. In this book the mythology behind the story is rich. You never feel like the characters walk and interact in vacuum (that's how I felt readingSome Girls BiteandHalfway to the Grave). Whatever is written about the Turn, witchcraft, vampires is inventive and interesting.On the other hand, the writing is very rough - a lot of weird and fragmented sentences that at some point become annoying. Just as an illustration, here are some examples just from one page of the book:Face cold, I nodded, and she released me.Impressed anew by her crucifix, I set aside my dinner and scooted forward.Frightened, I flicked my gaze from her to the cross.Swallowing hard, I scooted back into my chair.Moving with a provocative slowness, Ivy took her cross off.You see what I am talking about?If the writing were a little better polished, some unnecessary descriptions and thoughts were removed from the narration, the characters made a bit more sense (I often couldn't understand why people did what they did in this book - why was Rachel sooo freaked out by Ivy, why her ex-boss wanted to kill her so badly, etc.), the novel would have been much more enjoyable and dynamic IMO.Also, some hottie would be a nice addition too. As of page 100 there are no available love interests, unless you count Ivy as one. But I am not sure if Rachel is the type of girl who is into girls? Am I wrong?Dead Witch Walkingis basically a book whose popular appeal I can sort of understand (like I understandMagic Bites's popularity) but that doesn't appeal to me personally. Many readers say that the series gets much better after book 3, but I am an impatient reader and don't give writers second chances.
