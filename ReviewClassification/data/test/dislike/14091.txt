(This is a massive pan. Just a heads-up.)I've finally given up on this series, though I'm embarrassed to say it took me about ten books to get there.This is another of those books where I loved the premise, but the execution made me gag. Anita is insufferable, self-centered and judgmental, and her self-justification for her transformation fromnoli me tangerevirgin to super-slut is laughable. (God apparently told her directly that it was okay. Whatever.)The appeal for me was always Richard the werewolf and Jean-Claude the vampire, whose relationship was obviously the true love story about to happen, but in later books they don't even appear. Contract problems? Scheduling conflicts with other projects? Why on earth would the author replace the most compelling characters with a series of beta males who Anita can control like she controls every other aspect of this world?Well, obviously, because this is Hamilton's fantasy, isn't it? Right down to the creation of a character that is the male version of Anita, so she can make love to herself. Yuck.
