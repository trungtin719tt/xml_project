I read this as soon as it came out. Had to have it in hardback because I couldn't wait for paperback and had to have my own precious copy. Wish I had waited or borrowed it from the library. I was so excited to see what Claire and Jamie were up to, but it was a very slow read, explaining every little thing in detail. I mean, I love to read books that don't gloss over the not-so-pretty parts of the day, but explaining that a child needs a diaper change, and it's unpleasant aroma, over and over and OVER again is ridiculous and boring. They didn't go anywhere for most of the book, staying in one place this time whereas in the other books they were hardy and seasoned travelers, falling into tons of mischief. This was a big disappointment, especially since the rest of the series is such a huge success! Read it anyway, just to get you to the next book in the series.
