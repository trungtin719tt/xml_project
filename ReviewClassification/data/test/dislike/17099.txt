I feel that this book has a target audience: people who like fly fishing, and that's it. I mean, I get that there are family aspects and even some stuff about religion. But it's buried under so much crap about fly fishing that by the time it gets to anything else, you don't really care, because you know the book is going to go right back to freaking fly fishing. I mean, the book even kind of sums up if a person is "beautiful" or "a bastard" due to how much the like fly fishing. And I must say, fly fishing? Seriously?You know what? Some people really don't warrant autobiographies. I am one of them, and so is Norman Maclean. And the unwarranted autobiographies shouldn't be written, and I think that was the first major mistake in writing this book, the second major mistake being in telling us ALL. ABOUT. FLY FISHING.I mean, DAMN.Also, did anyone else start laughing out loud when Norman was telling us about fish thinking about eggnog? What the hell? How would a fish even know what eggnog was? What would a fish care about eggnog? I mean, that thought just came out of the blue!
