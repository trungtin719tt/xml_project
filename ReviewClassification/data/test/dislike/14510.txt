I can hardly believe alot of the reviews I have been reading...You have three stories which are tied together loosely. Each story has basically the same and the plot line, which is the point, but then they are never expounded upon. You would need less than ten pages, per story line, to tell each of the three stories that were told...the rest was ridiculous and repetitive to the point of being ludicrous. I am sorry that I always finish what I begin to read in this instance...but I stopped right there and haven't bothered to wonder what the titles are to the rest in this series.
