I have no idea how to rate this book. I would say 5 stars to author Lauren Oliver in taking juveniles with a blatant disregard for humanity and turning it into the story of Sam who discovers the importance of humanity. Some of the thoughts that Sam would think as she would pass from one day to the next were beautifully thoughtful causing you to question how you treat and respect the people and things we have. How do we (ourselves) treat individual people? How much affect do we have on the world (people) around us? I think it is a thought provoking book. So I would give the author 5 stars to make us question how we treat others. But all the other parts of the book, in order to get her point across, were rough and depressing to read. I struggled through the majority of the book because of these 4 teenage girls and their behavior to others. There lack of caring was sorrowing for me the reader. The book may have been realistic but it was depressing to read. Thus is the reason for the 1 star rating.
