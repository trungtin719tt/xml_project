This book is little more than Stephen Dubner jerking off Steven Levitt, but that's not why it's a 1-star read. here's why:"Women's rights advocates... have hyped the incidence of sexual assault, claiming that one in three American women will in her lifetime be a victim of rape or attempted rape. (The actual figure is more like one in eight-but the advocates know it would take a callous person to dispute their claim.)"In the Notes for this chapter:"The 2002 statistics from the National Crime Survey, which is designed to elicit honest responses, suggests that the lifetime risk of a woman's being the victim of unwanted sexual activity or attempted unwanted sexual activity is one in eight[.]"Here, in a nutshell, is how the National Crime VICTIMIZATION Survey collects information on rape:Every six months, they ask everyone over 12 in a bunch of houses questions like:"41a.(Other than any incidents already mentioned,) has anyone attacked or threatened you in any of these ways -(e) Any rape, attempted rape or other type of sexual attack -"Followed up later with:"29c.You mentioned rape. Do you mean forced or coerced sexual intercourse?"It doesn't take a rocket scientist to see the flaws in the NCVS's methodology here. And to use it to glibly accuse "women's rights advocates" of somehow manipulating a kowtowed public is incredibly obnoxious. While I'd guess that Levitt might be right more often than wrong, it's not worth his smug, self-satisfied style. I recommend 'Bad Science' by Ben Goldacre. Similar schtick with substance instead of 'hype'.
