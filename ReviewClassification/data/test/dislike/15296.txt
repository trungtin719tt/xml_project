I really didn't like these books. I didn't care about either Elena or Stefan. I saw the previews for the CW show and thought the story looked good. But the TV show is a thousand times better than the book.I didn't like the self centered Elena or understand why anyone else would either. When she met Stefan I couldn't understand the obsession she had over him, and why she was so hurt that he didn't talk to her. When he finaly saved her at Halloween and they were in love I had to flip back in the book to make sure I didn't miss something. I mean how are they in love already? They never talked to each other, and he seemed to have a distain for her. Their relationship seems empty. I didn't feel like they cared for each other. At about page 222, when Stefan started to tell his back story and explain things to Elena, I thought that the series would start getting good. But no such luck, it was all contrite and boring. I didn't care what happened to anyone. I was almost hoping that Damon wouldv'e killed Stefan and then turned Elena. I got to chapter 6 in The Struggle, and just couldn't waste my time any more. I had to stop reading.
