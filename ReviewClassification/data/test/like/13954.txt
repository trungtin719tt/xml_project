I put off reading this for many,manyyears, and I'm kind of glad I did. Not because its a bad book, no, because its terrifyingly accurate.I worked for many years in a nursing home, specifically in the dementia ward. It was heartbreaking and incredibly difficult work, but also very rewarding. When this was published in 2007 I was on my way to becoming burnt out. It was hard to work with these wonderful, beautiful people, and to see their minds ravaged by this horrible, insidious disease. I was having a hard time leaving work at work, and - despite everyone telling me I should read it - avoided this book.Having changed careers I felt that now was the time to read this, and I'm so glad I did. I'm even more grateful to myself for having put if off for so long. I needed the buffer of time between my experiences and the heartbreaking story within these pages.I think this is an important book that everyone should read. It provides insight into what it means to be diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and just how devastating it is. Many people think dementia is just old age; being a bit forgetful, something that happens with the progression of time. That's simply not the case. This is a disease. One that affects the relatively young as well as the elderly. A disease that destroys you, and by you, I meanyou. It not only robs you of your memories and your life's experiences, its takes away the very thing that makes you, you. Your personality, your voice, your ability to interact and communicate, all the little tic's and nuances that make you unique.Still Alice is a brilliantly written, absorbing, and heartbreaking account of one woman's struggle, not just with the disease itself, but with herself, her family and her identity.I recommend this to everyone, not just people living with dementia (family, friends, loved ones etc) but also to people who have no experience with it.Heartbreaking, and harrowing. You will never forget this.
