One Foot In The Grave is the second installment of Night Huntress series and it is better than the first one. Bones is pretty different from the man he used to be in the previous book, more adorable and attractive, and yes, he's head over heels in love with Cat! (Why her!? I still don't get that!) Cat, on the other hand, is still that same annoying woman whom I can't bring myself to like.However, the story had a lot of interesting details, engaging plot, and it was fast-paced enough to hold my attention throughout. Besides, I really did enjoy reading this book so I sure will continue this series.
