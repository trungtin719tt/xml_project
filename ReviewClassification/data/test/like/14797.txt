Lovely writing in this story of a Welsh family in a coal-mining village (I think in the Rhondda valley area altough the author didn't specify) from about 1890 to 1910.While ostensibly about the Morgan family, this novel is documenting the end of an era. I had seen the film but years ago and I was struck when reading this by the similarities to the more recent film "Brassed Off" about the colliery closings in northern England (Yorkshire?) during Margaret Thatcher's time. Different times and places but the same loss of a way of life &amp; the same sense of sadness.Some of Llewellyn's descriptions caught my breath such as this one of Angharad when fighting with 14-year-old Huw:" 'I hate you,' she said, and wrapped her cloak round her so that she was a black pillar, with a white face and her eyes with glitter and shine to make you afraid."Even though I knew the ending, I found myself weeping. It wasn't just(view spoiler)[the death of Huw's father but the sense of alone-ness with all his brothers gone, one dead and 4 overseas.(hide spoiler)]And the loss of the family home which is being buried by the slag heaps (as the reader knows from the very first page) just makes it all more poignant.
