Pages: 200+So, it's safe to say that Chuck Palahniuk owns my soul. Not even a little bit of it. The whole thing.Invisible Monstersblew my mind. I spent a good chunk of the book stuck in confusion and my mind felt like it had just been exposed to the trippiest thing ever. But, as I like to think, what is a Chuck Palahniuk story without mental mind trips and without confusion? It is not a Chuck Palahniuk story at all!Right off the bat Palahniuk leaves his print by introducing a set of characters in the strangest, craziest way possible. In technicality, there is a beginning and an end, but to a reader there's no formal structure at all. Which works great for the story. The reader is pulled from the "beginning" to before the beginning to the middle to a house in who-knows-where to the pre-beginning again to the middle to the beginning to the end.If you don't plan on reading this book all in one sitting, don't start reading it. Chances are you'll just end up confusing yourself more, and who wants that?Repetition, my favorite Palahniuk weapon, is used intensely in the story. Me being a big fan of repetition, especially Chuck-style, thought this was a great story enhancer.Bottom line is, I expect no one to finish reading this review because I expect everyone to be outside buying this book already.
