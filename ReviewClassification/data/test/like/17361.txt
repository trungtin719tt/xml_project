The second book in 'The Iron Fey' series, 'The Iron Daughter' definitely had my attention from start to finish. I'm a sucker for angst and emotional pain in my romances. This book was jam-packed with both. However, it also had a healthy dose of action for the adventure junkies out there.'The Iron Daughter' begins with Meghan in captivity at the Winter Court. Ash has transformed into someone unrecognizable, denying any feelings for Meghan and turning his back on her. As his antics become crueler, Meghan is forced to come to terms with the possibility that she never really knew Ash at all.Appearances aren't always as they seem though. This is a lesson that Meghan learns time and time again as she attempts to navigate the politics and manipulative games of the Winter Court. The sadistic tendencies of the court members may be the only thing that Ash was fully honest about.As you can probably guess already, Queen Mab played a much more significant role in this book. Prince Ash's brothers were also introduced, making the story more multidimensional. Each has their own motives for their actions and their own agenda. The same is true for multiple characters in the Winter Court that also enter the picture during this book.Eventually, all hell breaks loose. Meghan and Ash are thrust back together by circumstance. Ash is faced with the same feelings of betrayal that Meghan had been forced to cope with when the tables are turned on him. There's nothing quite like the harsh sting of betrayal to put things in perspective.While there was plenty of angst and adventure to keep me engaged, I'd be lying if I said that there wasn't something that drove me crazy with this series. This series featured one of my biggest pet peeves in a story, beginning in the first book and only becoming more pronounced in subsequent books--the "perfect, dead ex-girlfriend". Every time I heard Ariella's name I wanted to scream, "Marsha, Marsha, Marsha!". Seriously! Who can compete with the beautiful ex-girlfriend that is canonized upon death? Nobody - that's who!In spite of the infuriating fixation with the dead ex, I still found this book to be a fantastic read overall. Aimed toward a younger audience than most of my book choices, I was able to listen to this story with my kids. Other than a few "mild" naughty words (no f-bombs or anything), there was no content that was concerning or too controversial for them to hear. In fact, it was kind of provided some insight into my fifth-grade daughter's blossoming interest in boys. I'll just say that I wasn't the only one in the car that was sick of the repeated mentions of the "perfect" Ariella.As expected, the book doesn't offer a lot of resolution. One adventure comes to a close and readers are primed for another one to begin. Luckily, I didn't start this series until all of the books had been released so I was able to jump into the next one immediately. Otherwise, the wait might have killed me.I listened to this book in the Audible format and I have to say that the narration was superb. I really enjoyed the voices for each character and the emotional responses of the characters was almost tangible. If you're an audiobook listener, I'd definitely give this audiobook a shot.
