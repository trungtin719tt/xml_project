I'll get something off my chest before reviewing this one. I was super annoyed to see all the negative reviews that the book wasn't the movie. Is this such a shock? In my opinion the shining was a better movie compared to the book but that's only because they couldn't really commit to some of the outlandish set pieces. Forrest Gump the movie is excellent and a very entertaining film, it should not have beat Pulp Fiction for best picture but that's another story. The book has some funny moments and a very odd space journey, the book is just very very different to the film. I liked that the book was different as you didn't know the story, Forrest still makes a fantastical journey but it involves wrestling, space, chess and a monkey. I struggled with the book for the first fifty pages as the grammer hurts the brain and it takes some getting use to. I mainly gave this four due to the sluggish middle, the whole cannibal idea was poor and just lacked anything creative. I honestly liked the story and will read the follow-up shortly, maybe. I'm interested to see what the author thinks of the movie because they just took aspects and ran wild. I'm actually shocked how different the lead character was, I actually think if I read this book before the movie, I might have been really annoyed. The film has a devoted following but its far from a faithful adaption of the source material and proves hollywood exploit writers given the chance. I like the movie and I like the book, two very different mediums with two very different voices. Forrest Gump in the book is very stupid and doesn't always win, in the movie he is stupid but succeeds at everything. Worth checking out but if you think Forrest Gump is the greatest movie, stay away and don't give a book a bad review, the movie did come out after the book.
