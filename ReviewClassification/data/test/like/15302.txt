I loved this book! Okay, love is a strong word, so as you can tell I'm using it lightly. I did like this though, I, of course had seen the entire show before picking this up, and I have to say that they are nothing alike. Where did a little sister come from? There's no Jermey? Meredith? Since when? I don't mind the differences though, because I'm getting two stories along the same premis. What I didn't like though is how I never knew when Elena and Stefan got together, it kind of, just, happened. I didn't like that, and I know I didn't skip pages, I know this much.I found myself taking a while to finish this, I don't know why. I assumed I would be heavily engaged with this read. I did like it, just, I don't even know. I gave this four stars because, well, I like the characters, so I may be bias, I just don't know how I feel about the story in this book.Anyways, I did like the book over all, of course I am going to pick up the continuation of the books (which I own), but I have more books to focus on. I would recommend this book if you want a light vampire romance read, but if you are looking for something more rated R, I would recommend the Sookie Stackhouse series, and if you are looking for more thriller action, I would recommend the Anita Blake series!
