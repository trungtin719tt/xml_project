I read started Safe Haven this morning on the drive up to Colorado. I barely stopped listening to it at all. Probably three times at the most. I loved every little thing about Nicholas' story. From the beginning, so gripping I was into the story instantly. To the characters who were each phenomenally written in which I'll be adding details to next:Kevin, I've never been so scared of a character. I mentally flinch at the way he thought. And how much he believed what he was telling himself. I know that there are most defiantly people like that in the world. So wound up in their lies that they just become one. Not only lying to others but to themselves. Becoming the lies they tell. It breaks my heart, to think of all the people like that and how much they are suffering. Though most don't even know they are having never felt the joy/love to miss it.Moving on we have Katie. She's so strong. What she's been through and how she has pushed through from her challenges as a child; her dad being a mean drunk, her never inviting anyone home, getting kicked out after graduation, never the helping hands or encouragement to go to college, her parents dying I a car accident and on. The list goes on. What she went through as a child just to jump into abusive marriage after she meets the guy from getting jumped! How?! How can someone go through that and still be able to know how to care for a person? How to know when to stand up, or stay down for the threatening times for survival? Such courage showed her an every given moment just from what she survived and yet she's still completely selfless. The exact opposite of what Kevin was yelling and hitting at her for. Because she "only thought of herself" SHE DID ANYTHING BUT THAT! Oh, it still makes me so angry. She constantly fought to not give up, so full of faith. She was incredible to read about.Alex, what an example! His situation with his kids is a common one in our real world today and he handled it all so well. His actions and thoughts so humane in everything he did making me love reading his POV. It definitely wasn't my normal fantasy or contemporary YA read. This characters felt real and acted as such. Him Never yelling, lying, yes he wasn't perfect (no one is) but he became the best he could be and always tried to stick to that. I definitely want someone in my future life to be able to treat me with the same kind of respect as he did Katie as well as his children. Oh, I could rant on of how he was protective. Instantly bolting from his store when he took notice that his dear child was thrashing in the water. Worry and love consume his thoughts for him. Okay, okay I'll stop now and move on;)And lastly Joe. How much this story revolved around her just blew, BLEW my mind away. How much I respected her as Katie quietly read her letter... I don't believe I've felt that for a character before. Joe, Christy, Alex's first wife or whoever you want to call is someone I want to grow up and become like. I want to be selfless and love my husband and children that much that I would do anything and everything for their happiness. This story is perfect. So many messages were brought across from it. So many important morals.I was totally crying silently in the car with my two brothers and my dad. How embarrassing ha ha. Thankful Kent and Richard were asleep and my dad is driving in front of me, so I don't think he noticed if so he didn't comment. So yes this book was everything. I will most definitely be reading Nicholas Sparks books in the future, I'm so impressed with his writing. It cannot compare. If you haven't read Safe Haven and like thrillers you'll adore this one. Please read, and thank you can thank me later for it ;)
