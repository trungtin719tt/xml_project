People who have never been through any sort of shit always assume that they know how you should react to having your life destroyed...As if there's a playbook for surviving hell.The resignation and grief, the guilt and self-hatred. Especially the 'getting away from your loved ones' thing?Bull's eye.**If you want to learn a bit about how people, in the real world,actually deal with guilt and loss and profound disappointment,this book would be illuminating to you.** And I can't say that emphatically enough because plently of times it hit just so close to home.Josh,bless him but for all his brooding and adorableness andastronomically shitty luck,I can't fully gasp him. While I still sincerely liked his character, he didn't take a full shape for me if that makes any sense.Nastyaon the other hand, I couldn't avoid her if I'd tried. She smacked right in my face.A lot of what Nastya thinks of, I have thought about more than once. A lot of shit she tries to avoid, I have been trying to avoid them. Both successfuly and some not so successful but still. You get the picture. At times it was like looking in a mirror - it was freakish I tell you.I should have been horrified to read this book but I simply wasn't,I was too hookedfor that. I should have taken breaks but I didn't even think about doing that, to be honest. And there I was - sprawled on my bed, exhausted at 7:30 in the morning. With wet spots on my pillows, my eyes ached and swollen, wondering how Katya Millay did it.I'm tired of being responsible for other people's misery. I can't even put up with my own.
