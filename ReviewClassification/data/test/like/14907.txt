This quirky story of a young girl who lives in a trailer in a Walmart parking lot captured my imagination and my heart. The movie version wasn't bad, either. Going to add this one to my reread list. I love ordinary people, going through all the usual trials and tribulations that beset the human race, who somehow make it to the other side with hope in their hearts. This was a fabulous read!
