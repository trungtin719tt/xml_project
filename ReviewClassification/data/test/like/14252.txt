I keep forgetting how many good books I've read over the years. :PThis is an amazing book, and should seriously be read by everyone who is sick of cliche story lines. The characters are awesome, and the setting is sheer genius. I love how the author makes it so REAL to the reader, even when *spoiler* you find out later the city is actually underground...not just a city in a dark universe *end of spoiler*.Amazing writing, brilliant plot, and characters you can learn from = the perfect story. (Or as near to a perfect story as one can possibly get in this world ;)Though a part of a series, this story can totally be read as a stand alone.The second book is ok, though not nearly as good as the first one, and I haven't even read the third book because my older siblings read it and said they didn't like it (and I trust their judgement ALWAYS when it comes to books).So now you need to go read this book. Go, go, go! It's probably at your library. :)
