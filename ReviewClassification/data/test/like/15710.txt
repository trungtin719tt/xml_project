I finishedAround the World in 80 Daystoday and it was even better than I remembered from my childhood. Admittedly, the version I had read as a child was theGreat Illustrated Classicsedition that was, unfortunately, abridged. I felt that a reading of the unabridged classic was long overdue. Shockingly enough, I still remembered the ending 20 years later.Just the task Phileas Fogg faces in traveling the world in 80 days (in the 19th century) and the obstacles that pop up to delay his travels would make for a fabulous story, but the element of a cat-and-mouse chase really puts this book over the top! I highly recommend it for anyone who loves grand adventure stories.I can see why Jules Verne is touted as one of the finest French authors. He is deserving of all accolades!
