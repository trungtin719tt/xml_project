It's easy to allow yourself to get bored with this one. But push through it; you won't regret it. This is a story about two brothers who grow up fly fishing, and they're taught by their minister father how physical grace and spiritual grace can become the same thing through fishing. It's a beautiful story. It got me to thinking about what in my life helps me gain physical and spiritual grace at the same time. What's the one thing you do that is spiritual to you, but maybe not to anyone else. The author didn't start writing until he was in his 70's, so you know he wrote about what really mattered to him. This is a must read.
