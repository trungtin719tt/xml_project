"There is no justice. There is only me."Well this was flipping great!My first step into Terry Pratchett's Discworld (I know right?!)This one tells the story of a young man called Mort who becomes Death's apprentice, along with all of the tasks and responsibilities that come with it.This world is so vivid and imaginative, I was completely transported into this weird and wonderful universe with all its characters, including wizards, princesses, Death's daughter and of course Mort and Death himself.Naturally Mort is clumsy, and mistake-prone, he spends a good portion of the story attempting to fix his mistake of saving the life of a princess who was supposed to die, therefore knocking all reality out of sync. The story itself is simple to follow, what makes this book so incredible is the fantastic descriptions of the way this universe works and the different realities and places and people, which are so complex it's absolutely astounding! It seemed never ending. I didn't want to leave this world and I will definitely be returning soon!
