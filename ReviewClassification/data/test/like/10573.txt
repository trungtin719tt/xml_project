I LOVE ANNE SO MUCH.This book was a great continuation of her story and I love seeing Anne and her friends start to become adults while still keeping their fantastic personalities.Gilbert is also my fave forever especially because he is WAITING FOR HER without expecting anything beyond friendship - though he is still hopeful, he's more concerned about being a man worthy of her while being her friend, not convincing her he's a "nice guy".
