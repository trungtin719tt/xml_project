A Wizard of Earthsea by Ursula K. Le Guin is a beautiful fantasy.First published in 1968, it has clearly influenced many fantasy novels since. Orson Scott Card, with his 1980s era Alvin Maker series, stated that he wanted to make an American fantasy, and escape or at least distinguish his work from the inherently English Tolkien sub-genre of fantasies. This is not quite such a departure from the Tolkienesque fantasies, but a difference can be seen and enjoyed.Another Goodreads reviewer made the observation that the Harry Potter series has been wildly successful while Earthsea has achieved only a cult following and peer respect. I can wholly agree with this finding and think it too bad that so many young readers have not discovered this gem of the genre.My admiration for Le Guin continues to grow, she is an amazing writer.**** 2018 Re-readSecond time around I was not as entranced by the story itself but still amazed and inspired by her timelessness, her forward vision and for what this book has meant to the genre.I wondered again about the influence this may have had over J.K. Rowling, perhaps has the book itself, or just a foundation on our modern fantasy literature.I also compared the long voyage sequences here to the long walk across the glacier in her Hainish bookThe Left Hand of Darknessand see that a journey tale may be a ubiquitous theme in her writing, a metaphor for growth and spiritual evolution.A good book by itself and a wonderful work for fantasy writing as a whole.
