4.5/5 stars.This is a wonderful and very clever piece of fiction about how we tend to remember things from our past fondly while forgetting about how bad things really were. "How Green Was My Valley" is a book about nostalgia and it is told from the point of view of Huw, who is now an elder, but who reflects back on his life and his childhood in the valleys of Wales.This novel was wonderfully written with beautiful passages on life as well as note-worthy anecdotes on Huw's childhood and amazing family. A few passages became a bit too dense in their descriptions, but most of them were wonderful.I think this book speaks to a lot of us because it talks about a universal subject, and I'm sure that's why it has become a classic and has survived through time. "How Green Was My Valley" comes with its brutalities where things that were not so "green" shine through the surface, but most of all it comes with a view on life which I think most of us share: a view of nostalgia and fondness.
