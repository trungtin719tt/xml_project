How excited are you that this is becoming a Netflix show?! :DI went into this book with pretty low expectations. Everyone seemed to not love it and I wanted to read it just so I could get to the Six of Crows duology. Well turns out I really liked it.Even more than Six of Crows!Not a fan of the romance/love triangle ish but the world is interesting and the magic system is awesome.The first book is my favorite of the trilogy!I recommend you read this before reading Six of Crows. I know everyone says you don't need to but I highly disagree!
