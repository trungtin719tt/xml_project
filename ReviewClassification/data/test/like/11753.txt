Its my favorite book till date. One word for it - WOW..Its just amazing and the way the author has described the life of a man in the prisons is amazing. Its wonderful how he tells this man's story spanning so many years. I saw this movie as a kid..I must be very young then maybe class 5 or younger..and ever since then I had a desire in me to read this book whenever I get a chance.Papillon means butterfly and it symbolises the protagonists' desire to get free from the clutches of jail. The vivid description is just too good to miss and the book too good to be put down.I also like it because I am great fan of escape stories, prison accounts, prisoner of war and other war stories.
