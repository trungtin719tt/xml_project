The Arden Shakespeare series is, for my money, the premier set of editions for the rigorous study of Shakespeare's plays. In the case of one of Shakespeare's most popular (and most troubling) plays, editor Brian Morris makes a compelling case for Shakespeare's version of this play being the source rather than the revision of the stage tale, since there is another play with similar title from the same period which tells, much less poetically, the same story, of a man who brings his intended bride into compliance (and, perhaps, agreement) with his will. Despite its long popularity, the play has especially in the past century come under scrutiny and criticism for its apparent delight in the subjugation of women to the power and will of their husbands. Morris gives some credibility to the notion that there is a more feminist point of view in the play than is generally suspected, though I doubt it will convince the most fervent dismissers of the play. Sexual politics aside, it is a deliciously funny, witty play, and Morris's introduction, with historical context for both the writing and the performing of the play, along with the invaluable footnotes to the play itself, make this edition of The Taming of the Shrew a necessity for anyone who wants to understand Shakespeare's work.
