Having been raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints I was exposed to this book at an early age. Regardless, I did not seriously read this book until my early 20's. At that time I truly wanted to know for myself if it was the word of God as proclaimed by the church I belonged to. Because of my experience with this book and the Spirit of God, my life was enhanced immeasurably - I know that Jesus Christ lives and is the resurrected Savior of mankind. I know that God exists and I know that He truly loves me because of the gift of His Son's life and atonement. I do not have to guess who I am and what I am here for, this book and the Holy Spirit of God have made it plain to me! Am I fanatical? Delusional? Find out for yourself. Put the book to the test - read it; then ask God the Father in the name of Christ if it is true - He will "manifest the truth of it unto you". This is something between you and your God, only you can do this for yourself, no one can stand in for you here. He does answer sincere prayers and He will speak peace unto your soul!
