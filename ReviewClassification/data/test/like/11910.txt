I don't know what I can say more than has been said, but I wish to add my voice to those who know this book to be true. I would like to issue a challenge to everyone--regardless whether or not you have read it:1. Obtain a brand new, unmarked copy of the Book of Mormon. One of the free copies that missionaries give out works great. You will also need a colored pencil.2. Over a period of ~60 days (10 pages/day) scan read the book doing three things:1. Circle any reference to Christ's names. i.e. Savior, Redeemer, Lamb of God, Messiah, etc.2. Shade in any of His attributes. i.e. mercy, omnipotent, omniscient, etc.3. Underline any of His direct words (i.e. 1 Ne 14:7- I will work a great and marvelous work amongthe children of men...)This isn't meant to be an in-depth study of the book, but rather to show a person that this book really does testify of Christ.Some of my favorite passages:1 Nephi 1:20 (pg 3) - I, Nephi, will show unto you that the tender mercies of the Lord are over all those whom he hath chosen, because of their faith, to make them might even unto the power of deliverance.2 Nephi 25:23, 26 (pg 99) - For we labor to write, to persuade our children, and also our brethren, to believe in Christ, and to be reconciled to God; for we know that it is grace that we are saved, after all we can do...And we talk of Christ, we rejoice in Christ, we preach of Christ, we prophesy of Christ, and we write according to our phophecies, that our children may know to what source they may look for a remission or their sins.Jacob 4:6 (pg 124) - Wherefore, we search the prophets, and we have many revelations and the spirit of prophecy; and having all these witnesses we obtain a hope, and our faith becometh unshaken, insomuch that we truly can commandin the name of Jesusand the very trees obey us, or the mountains, or the waves of the sea.Alma 58:10-11 (pg 355) - Therefore we did pour out our souls in prayer to God, that he would strengthen us and deliver us out of the hands of our enemies, yea, and also give us strength that we might retain our cities, and our lands, and our possessions, for the support of our people. Yea, and it came to pass that the Lord our God did visit us with assurances that he would deliver us; yea, insomuch that he did speak peace to our souls, and did grant unto us great faith, and did cause us that we should hope for our deliverance in him.All of Moroni 7 (pg 521)There are many more that I am not able to post. I encourage everyone to read this book many many times!
