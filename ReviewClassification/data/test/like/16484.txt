I like reading a book's bad reviews much more than its good reviews. The bad ones, the one and two stars reviews, are usually written by a.) illiterates and often hilarious, or by b.) highly educated well-read smarties and almost always hilarious. (I search goodreads for these and I've found enough to make, if gathered up and organized, a great book of their own.) This book has no bad reviews since it's brand new - and I ain't about to be the first person to write one. I loved the damn thing. Wandering around in the desert with a clueless helpless hapless housewife, facing down bobcats and gila monsters and tarantulas and New York City cowboys and rude old bald women and drunken bone snatchers and thorns and kissing bugs and heat, what could be better than that? She makes best friends with an ass. I came to love that ass as much as I came to love Molly Brock (Mrs. Peter Warner as was) growing up at a late age in a world of certain pain and potential death. Longfellow keeps writing completely different books in perfectly suited prose and this one is no exception. She doesn't repeat herself. Some people want to read the same book over and over and make some writer rich. Some people, like me, love to read really good books, period. In its own way Walks Away Woman is as meaningful as The Secret Magdalene or Flow Down Like Silver.
