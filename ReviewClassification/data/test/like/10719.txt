I am pretty late to this party as this was my firstMaria V. Snyderbook and I liked it very much. It is one of those books which is very hard to put down. I kept thinking "Just one more chapter, just one more" until suddenly I had finished. And even then I did not want to put it down. Fortunately the next book is lined up ready.........I enjoyed everything about this book. Yelena is a genuinely strong female main character. One who can actually defeat a baddy without a man coming in at the end to save her. In fact she can manage more than one when she gets going! Best of all she is only in love with one man, not two. That is very important to me these days in YA books!I liked the world building, the magic system, the characters, the pacing of the book. I liked everything:) An excellent book.
