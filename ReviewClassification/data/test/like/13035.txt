Wicked and wonderful in equal measure! Any way you choose to view it - a magical woman brings whimsy to the Banks' house, a sadistic 'good' witch gaslights a couple of children, or the Banks kids have wild imaginations bordering on insanity - P.L.

But she held on tightly, and that, apparently, was what the wind wanted her to do, for presently it lifted the umbrella higher into the air and Mary Poppins from the ground. It carried her lightly so that her toes just grazed along the garden path. Then it lifted her over the front gate and swept her upwards towards the branches of the cherry-trees in the Lane.
