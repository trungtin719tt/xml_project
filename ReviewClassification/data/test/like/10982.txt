I thought this book was wonderful and it's definitely in my top 10 of favourite books.A story about mental illness and how it affects a family. The main character and narrator Frank is very likable despite his strange and homicidal tendencies. It's written in a lovely style that makes it a pleasure to read.It's a story about childhood, family, nurture versus nature, secrets, violence, murder, mental illness, adaptability, being different &amp; thriving despite it all. There are unexpected plot twists which keep the story interesting &amp; astounding at times.I highly recommend it as it's basically a great story.
