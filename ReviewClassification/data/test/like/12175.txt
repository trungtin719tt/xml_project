This was such a poignant, well-written little story. It's a short, easy read and the voice feels very authentic. This a great portrayal of loss, confusion, and just general growing up. I would absolutely recommend this to any child, particularly one experiencing the loss of a close family member.(Yes, I did read it two days in a row, that's not a glitch haha. I liked it so much, I listened to it with a family member the next day so they could hear it, too).
