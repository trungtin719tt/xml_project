Required reading assignments in school often aren't the most enjoyable reads, and the element of compulsion may prejudice the reader against them, but this novel proved to be a happy exception to that pattern! (Obviously, given the time frame, I read it in a different edition than the one above.) The above description of "faith and society" as Eliot's subject matter here is apt. After being cast out by his narrow religious sect when he is framed for a theft, Silas becomes an embittered and reclusive atheist and miser. Years later, on a single night, his hoarded gold is stolen and an apparently orphaned and abandoned toddler comes into his life. Modern adaptations of this novel, and much criticism of it, tend to concentrate wholly on the fascinating interpersonal and social dynamics; but for the author, the story of Silas' recovery of faith in God, through the gift of the child, is equally central. (Eliot wasn't a Christian; but she was most definitely a theist, and religion was an important concern to her.)The plotting of this novel is flawless, each element dovetailing neatly into the whole. Stylistically, it displays Eliot's characteristic combination of Romantic and Realist features into a satisfying whole that appeals to the reader's emotions, but also presents realistically drawn people in a setting authentically brought to life.
