Questions arising out of my reading of this book:1. Why have I never read Richard Matheson before?2. Why did no one ever tell me what an amazing storyteller Matheson is?3. How does someone channel such elegant prose, and such profound imagination, into a story with so much humanity?4. Why was I unaware of how incredibly influential Matheson's story has been on multiple genres, from post apocalypse tales, to zombie plagues and vampire ficion?5. Why did Will Smith and the Hollywood "brain trust" so completely alter the plot and ruin the spirit of the original?6. Why did no one get punched for the travesty mentioned in 5 above?7. Will I ever forget the haunting final words of this incredible story? (I think I know the answer to this one.)
