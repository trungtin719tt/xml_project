This is a great book and I can understand how it's rightfully considered a classic, but I have to imagine this is as uninspiring to our generation as the first iPhone manuals will be in 150 years.When this was written, the idea of naval travel was only practically available to the rich and, beyond that, the concept of a submarine was on the same lines as a rail gun or UAV to us. We've probably imagined - either through stories, video games or whatever - that such things could exist in our world but most of us won't ever get to interact with them or have an inside look at their mechanics.Verne gave the people of the world that exact view of an unimaginable submarine 80 years before U-boats stalked the western banks of his homeland. We STILL don't know 20% of the secrets the ocean holds and that number was effectively 0% in 1868, so I have a tremendous respect for the feeling of quest, exploration and wonder Verne imbued his work with. Since many Europeans never even had contact with oceans in their lives (provided they lived inland - no cars, expensive trains and unstable boats), this would have been absolutely riveting to them.And with that, I find myself lost with the biology and chemistry on display in M. Arronax's notes. There are time where the species he investigates feel like shopping lists (which is the point, the perspective Verne went for here was a notebook, not a first person recollection - which he also did in Harry's notebook for Journey to the Center of the Earth) and, after always being taught that shopping lists are wrong in prose, they stick out to me like the knuckles of a sassy Catholic boy after the nun fetched the ruler.Outstanding story but I would have had a bit better time with it if the biological observations didn't seem so numerical. Either way, though, outstanding.Also, Verne's adherence to the "central fire" - a scientific observation that the earth had a liquid iron core, which was disputed in his lifetime - is sensational. He was an author who wrote better than everyone and knew more than most scientists in the process. The compressed air, electric lamps and diving suits used onboard the nautilus directly influenced the first generations of diving apparati used by the British, German and American navies in the 1880s. Amazing.
