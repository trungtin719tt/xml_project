The Yellow Wallpaper is a chilling and brilliant short story of 6000 words by Charlotte Perkins Gilman.Written in 1892 it is one of the first pieces of feminist literature available.The story chronicles the descent of a woman into madness after she's kept under house arrest by her husband given her early signs of depression and anxiety.This book was written in a conservative era where in women were not allowed to read and write and voice their opinions.What's really thought provoking and disturbing is that Gilman's work is as relevant today as it was then.The Yellow Wallpaper is hands down the best short story I've ever read.A must read if you are a woman. Or not.
