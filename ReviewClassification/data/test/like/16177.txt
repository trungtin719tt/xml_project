"Book, you have the right to a speedy trial"reviewTHE DEFENSE-Lead heroine is funny and engaging, yet also flawed enough to feel real- I felt I could relate whenever Rachel Morgan did something stupid...plus when book characters screw up, it makes me feel not as bad for doing at least 8,000 stupid things a day!(That's an exaggeration, of course! I only do 7,999 stupid things a day tops!)-I also loved the supporting cast- Ivy the vampire is moody yet oh-so-adorable, Keasley never loses his cool, and Jenks the pixie may be the greatest scene-stealer since Winona Ryder told the makers of Girl Interrupted,"So what if Angeline Jolie is fairly new at this, everyone will just be watching me anyway!"-Magic system is far more thought-out than in most novels- Rachel doesn't just wiggle her nose and make stuff happen, there are very strict procedures she has to adhere to and limitations to her spells. Making Rachel powerful but not "I can kick your ass with just my earlobe"powerful added greatly to the suspense.-Interesting variation on the theme of vampire seduction- Since vampires are usually seen willingly seducing others, it was a nice change of pace to watch Ivy have to fight her natural instincts and try so hard NOT to seduce Rachel!THE PROSECUTION-Main story is severely lacking- Rachel leaves her job and now her former bosses are trying to kill her...annnnnnndthat's pretty much it for the first 200 pages!-Some of the plot points make no sense when you think about them:DENON - "I've been trying to get Rachel to quit for the last two years, using my position as her boss to make her job a living hell!"AIDE - "Gee, if you want her out so bad, why don't you just fire her?"DENON - "...bosses can actually FIRE employees?!? Why...why was that not made clear to me before now?!?"-Lead villain stumbles into Dr. Evil territory at times- "Now that Rachel is trapped in the form of a mink and I have her locked up in this cage, I'll defeat her by enrolling her in a rat fight...you know, the one that takes place in a wide open area with plenty of opportunities for the combatants to escape...why are you all just shaking your heads at me, it's a brilliant plan, dammit!"-Way too many unanswered questions at the end!- Okay, I understand this is only the first book in the series and the author wants to stretch some mysteries out, but it would have been nice if at least ONE of the questions raised in the book had been answered within these 400 pages! Exactly what kind of paranormal entity is the lead villain? What secrets is Rachel's newest ally hiding? Who sent the demon to kill Rachel? Your guess is as good as mine even after I read the book!THE VERDICT3.5 Not-For-Everybodystars. I enjoyed the characters enough to overlook the flawed main story and multiple plot-holes, but people looking for a more cohesive story may find this one frustrating. Still, I hear this series only gets better, so I will certainly be revisiting The Hollows in the very-near future!
