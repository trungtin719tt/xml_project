So good. The characters stayed with me throughout the 2 weeks I needed to finish this book. It's a long, descriptive novel that needed the excess of pages to fully tell its story. Make it all the way through. Refrain from putting it down like some other reviewers did. It's a hard book, I'd guess, much like the old western frontier.
