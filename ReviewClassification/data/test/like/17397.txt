Overall I really liked this story.It clearly reads like classic fantasy. Not a lot of grit, graphic violence or sex. Especially the missing "Sex sells" attitude is a reason for me too love the classics though ;)I had quite some "Is this Tolkien?" moments, but it wasn't enough to actually annoy me. (Example: Meet some dwarfs - and the only way to get somewhere is through the abandoned mines, and whatever's in there...)At parts it could have been slimmed down a bit, but overall the story was really interesting, and kept me engaged and well entertained all the way through.I liked most main characters - though they were a bit too smooth and sometimes too naive for me. Especially the good guys are just SO very good.(view spoiler)[Also they tend to get saved at the last minute a lot - this is definitely not Game of thrones.(hide spoiler)]But at least there isn't really a "bad guy" - there's two sides of the coin, and although you clearly know who to root for, you get a close look at the other side and their reasoning too. That's something I enjoy tremendously.It is very old school though - so if you don't like the fantasy classics, this might not be your cup of tea.
