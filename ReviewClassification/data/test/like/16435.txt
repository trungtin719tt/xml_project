I've been putting off writing a review forThe Far Pavilionsbecause it's so complex and epic that I feel like I can't do it justice without writing an equally epic review. But I've put this off for too long already and so we'll all just have to be satisfied with a less impressive but more manageable review.This story takes place in India during the mid-1800s, when the British controlled India as part of their far-flung empire. Ashton Pelham-Martyn is the son of an English professor and explorer of India. He's orphaned at a very young age and, for various reasons, ends up being unofficially adopted by an Indian widow, who calls him "Ashok" and keeps him as they travel to northern India, in sight of the mystical Himalayan mountains, which young Ash worshipfully calls the "Far Pavilions":Ash's formative years are spent immersed in Indian culture. When his adoptive mother is dying when he is about 11 years old, she finally tells him that he is British, not Indian, and soon Ash is packed off to England to get an education and develop this part of his heritage. Everyone involved wants him to become a card-carrying member of the stiff-upper-lip highbrow British society, with just enough retained knowledge of Indian languages and culture to make him useful to the British army.It never quite takes.Ash is a mix of both East and West, which is uncomfortable for both himself and everyone around him. He tells Koda Dad, his Indian father figure, that he will "always be two people in one skin--which is not a comfortable thing to be." Koda Dad responds that "you may discover in yourself a third person who is neither Ashok nor Pelham-Sahib, but someone whole and complete."The conflict between East and West, both in Ash's soul and in this part of the world generally, is one of the major themes of this book, but there is so much more: an amazing love story with more ups and downs than a roller coaster, a terrifying dive into a corner of India that has preserved its same brutal, backward culture for hundreds of years, and the British battle for a foothold in Afghanistan.The love story epitomizes the divide between India and Britain, but also evinces the hope that there can be an understanding between them. "There was nothing that he could not tell her or that she would not understand, and to lose her now would be like losing his heart and his soul. And what man can live without the one, or hope for Heaven without the other?"The last couple of hundred pages of the book turn in a quite different direction and focus on different characters--although the same themes continue to surface in new ways. Frankly, this part dragged for me, particularly as it evolved into an astoundingly detailed retelling and analysis of an actual historic one-day conflict in Afghanistan. I was tempted to dock a full star for that. But overall this is such an amazing, well-researched story that I have to round up. I was sniffling and wiping away tears as I finished the book. Truly, it's epic in every sense of the word.4.5 stars.July 2014 buddy read with Diane, Kathy, Hana and Felicia.
