Well that ending is a really sad thing. I'm hoping something can change in the last book =(June and Day are sneaking their way into Vegas. They meet up with The Patriots and Tess. Day gets some new armor so to speak. They make plans to assassinate the new Elector, Anden. But . . . not everything is as it seems and maybe, just maybe, Anden can be trusted. Although, in this world it's really hard to trust any one.June goes undercover so to speak and finds out some information, the kind she wasn't expecting to find out.I still loved the book. I loved the action. I loved most everything but that one revelation and I will never tell. Of course, most of you have read the books anyway.On to the next . . .MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List
