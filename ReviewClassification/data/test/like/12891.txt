I feel as though I just went on a wonderful date with this book, but now I'm trying to justify to my friends, myself and the book why this isn't true love. Or at least true literature.Like most page-turners, the dialogue is snappy, the ruminations are written like people talk, and the story is mostly plot-driven in a sea of Omigodwhathappensnext adrenaline. (And that scene where the new boyfriend nervously plays a game with the girlfriend's family only to play too hard and have everyone glaring at him? IT'S BEEN DONE.) But so much of it was just so charismatic, so unforgivingly honest, that I often found myself putting it down in order to soak it all up. And I kept having arguments with myself as to whether or not I was really in love with real Literature.Before I come off as any more of a snob, let me state my standards. Literature sets itself apart from genre fiction because it doesn't rely on formulas. A story avoids formulas by having a) complex, realistic characters, b) a creative writing style, c) an overarching theme about the human condition. So, doesOne Dayhave what it takes to keep itself out of the Romantic Comedy genre section?A) Emma and Dexter are carefully crafted characters whose brilliant inner monologues could never translate to well film. Unlike so many modern authors, Nicholls understands Her as well as he understands Him, assigning them both self-destructive tendencies and a profound capacity for love. That they are constantly pointing out each other's flaws and constantly making each other laugh makes theirs one of the few literary relationships based not on passionate romance but passionate respect. (And respect is freakin' romantic.) Unfortunately, most of the supporting characters are stereotypes used mainly to tilt the reader's sympathy back to the main two. Whatever selfish mistakes Emma and Dexter make, Suki is just too ditzy, Ian is just too inept, Sylvie is just too cold, and Mr. Godalming is just too nondescript for the reader to ever risk siding with them. A few points lost there, but stereotypes can also be used to reflect the society in which the main characters are trying to survive (seeAmerican BeautyorWhite Teethfor more of that) and Nicholls does sometimes pull this off quite well.B) An accessible style need not be shallow. Nicholls's descriptions never risk distracting you from the plot, but they decorate it very well. ("She looked up at the ceiling as if she were giving someone the chance to hide.") The story's structure, jumping one year ahead with each chapter, is clever and tantalizing, warning the reader that no scenes will be guaranteed. And, like the main characters, Nicholls can be very, very witty, when he wants to be. ("In a war film, Ian would be little Tommy writing home to his mother. Dexter would be, well, an effete Nazi.")*MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD*C) The theme is perhaps the weakest part. Crazy stupid love and the difficulty of growing up aren't the most challenging topics ever put to paper, and the speed at which this story was turned into a screenplay at least whispers "standard fare." But it's no surprise the film did badly because Emma and Dexter are NOT just two cuties who riff until it's time for the Cinderella ending. They're friends first and foremost, and, as the NY Times observed earlier this year, pop culture doesn't have many stories about friendship. It doesn't really know what do with it. Nicholls does.He's written that he feels ambivalent about leaving Dexter and Emma childless, but this was one of my favorite aspects of the plot because it serves as a testament to the strength of their friendship. They don't need a biological symbol of their loyalty to one another in order to justify it.He loses a few points for talking so much about sex without proving he can write a sexy line describing the act. (FYI, "flesh" is not a very sexy word.) But their sexy friendship is portrayed in such a rainbow of delicate details that anyone who's had a crush on a close friend will relate to at least a colorful handful of them. And nothing epitomizes Nicolls's commitment to portraying all that is cruel and banal and frustrating in life than the fact that he spends no more time on their marriage than he does on Dexter's bereavement. As Roger Ebert has pointed out, every love story ends in death, and unlike so many pop culture storytellers, Nicholls is brave to let us see how Dexter struggles with that, skipping the melodramatic moment of discovery and going straight to the hell of healing.Whether or not it's Literature, I am pleased as hell when there are books like this in the world. Like a fun date, there were points when I wished it could have been better, but I never wanted it to end.
