Solid. A good introduction to the world, the character and the magic. It finished up the main plot nicely and left some very interesting threads dangling that are undoubtedly pursued in later books. Several people told me that this was one of the 'weaker' Dresden books. I'll take that to mean that they just get better and better, as I found nothing weak here to complain about.
