Actual rating: 4.5 stars.It seems I read a lot of vampire books these days. In fact, I'm going through my TBR pile in order so it's not my fault I had three vampire books one after another. I really liked two and third is currently being read, so we'll see.I liked this book very much. Claire wasn't annoying like I expected, though she seemed like it when I first started reading. I liked most of the characters and everything went smoothly. Though it did end on a major cliffhanger, which I really don't like. Don't kill my sweety, please. I liked world building and the whole story of vampires running the whole city. What I didn't like is how the author made some characters seem complitely irrational. Take Monica for example. She wants to kill Claire just because she made her look stupid in front of her crowd. I get that her pride was crushed, but really? To kill a girl just because of it? And not to mention she set fire to Shane's house, which unintentionally (I hope) killed his little sister? She just seemed really ridiculous sometimes and I really laughed one or two times when she said something stupid.The romance is nothing like I wanted it to be. I wanted Claire to be with Michael, for god's sake! I don't like Shane, okay?! I don't feel anything towards him and I find him rather boring. Eve is really a sweetheart and I'm happy she found her happiness, but just not with the guy I wanted her to be!!!!!!!I really want to know what happens next. I hope Shane's dad won't do much damage on new-found truce between vampires and Glass Housers.
