A simple clean beautiful tale of a woman who has given up. The life we life, men and women, in the so-called First World - a life of specious achievement, the acquiring of stuff, the right marriage, the right job, the right neighborhood - is killing us all. Forget the corporations speeding up the process by killing the actual planet. No wonder Mrs. Warner wants out, permanently. I do too, more than I ever admit, even to myself. But she does it, she walks away. And into a new world the old Mrs. Warner couldn't even imagine. I LOVED this book.
