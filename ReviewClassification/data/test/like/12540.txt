4 starsA Historical Fiction detective crime thriller mystery with a twist of Holmes? I am not a Sherlock reader, but I imagine they probably read something like this. It was fascinating to be reading about suspect profiling and 'building a case' in a time when cars were still a horse and cart, fingerprint reading was deemed to be a dubious way to collect evidence and women were perfect for secretarial roles but not detective work. Go Sara!I detracted a star because there was just way too much superfluous detail in this book. Some of it was interesting to me, like what they were eating at each time they were dining, which was a lot, but often I was wishing I was reading a print book so I could skim the details of the decor of a room or whatever that added no value or enjoyment for me. Perhaps if GR had a half stars, I would be more inclined to give this a 3 and a half. The narrator was ok, but I wouldn't go looking for more books by him as he did tend to confuse his accents slightly every now and then.
