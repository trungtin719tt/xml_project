I think this book broke my brain.I mean, it's somanythings tied up in a slim little volume - an alt-history "what if Germany and Japan had won the Second World War," a meditation on the inability to ever accurately try to reconstruct what-might-have-beens, one of the most interesting literary experiments I've ever read, a look at chance and fate in how the world unfolds, and a book that can definitely bend your sense of reality.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the recent changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
