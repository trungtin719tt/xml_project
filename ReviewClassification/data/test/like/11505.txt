Whew. That was more than a marathon. What the Olympic sport where they ski and shoot stuff? This book is like that but add in finding a needle in a haystack, cutting gum from your hair, trying to remove blood stains from every item of clothing you wear every day for 6 months, participating in a spelling bee in a language you don't speak, and running for president in a country on another planet. Whew.There is a lot going on here. SO MUCH GOING ON HERE. I've sort of learned to love Roger more, but , yeah, no, really not so much. He's still kind of a lazy, entitled dick. I've certainly loved Brianna more. What a doer. That lady can't be stopped. Jaime. Claire. I love the both of you to the ends of your crazy hairs. Jem. You need to grow up. The BUGS! O.M.G. I'm destroyed. Malva. I cry for you Malva. I LOVE YOU MALVA! (bonus, my mother's first name is Melva, named after an uncle Melvin, gross, yeah? she hates it too. but now Malva is Melva and Melva is Malva for me. Uma meet Oprah, Oprah meet Uma)On to my re-read of book 8. I'll probably watch the whole freaking first half of the Starz season tonight. Well, not really, it's getting late, but, *sigh* I love this series and for all its faults it's a wonderful series about the love and loyalty and courage and power of family.
