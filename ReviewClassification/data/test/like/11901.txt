Without sounding sacreligious, I am profoundly grateful for this book. It's a book about answers to personal challenges. It's a book about how to live your life. It's a book about two civilizations and their relationship with a loving Father in Heaven.There really isn't a rating you could give something so profound and precious. And to this, I apologize.It is the BEST book I have ever read. This is at the top of my favorite list!!! For anyone who hasn't read this yet, and would like a free copy, I'd be glad to send you one! :-) It's worth your time. Just be prepared to have your life changed...for the better!!!
