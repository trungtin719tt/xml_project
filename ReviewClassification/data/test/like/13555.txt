Tender is the night is the sad story of Nicole and Dick Diver's fall of marriage and in the end career after being such an ideal example of a wealthy and happy couple in front of the world.Their richness reminded me of Fitzgerald's other works like The Great Gatsby and The beautiful and Damned.I bought this book by mistaking it to The other side of Paradise by him, because I thought Charlie from Perks of Being Wallflower had this book in his read-list.I enjoyed reading this Jazz Era book and finding similarities between the characters and the writer's life, gave a chilling and thrilling kind of experience.
