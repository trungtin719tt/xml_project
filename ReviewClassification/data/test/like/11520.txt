I love A Christmas CarolI can't believe I have just NOW read this book. I have been watching the MANY movies of A Christmas Carol since I was a little kid. My favorite being the one with Albert Finney, that seemed to be the one I watched the most. I have it on dvd (maybe blu ray, I would have to look) and I have the VHS tape for a long time. Remember those? I also have The Muppet Christmas Carol and The Christmas Carol with Jim Carey. You know I think after reading this book I'm going to have to dig out the movies and watch them this weekend.**Spoilers for any that haven't seen the movie or read the book, if that exists**Most everyone knows that Scrooge is visited by his old friend Marley and he was a ghost!He told Scrooge some things about life and told Scrooge he would be visited by three ghosts that might help him change his ways so he wouldn't end up like Marley.Of course Scrooge wanted none of that, he was scared out of his wits. But going with the ghosts was not so bad. Yes, there were some tears but there was some happiness as well. After the last ghost, Scrooge woke up a changed man. He was happy to be alive, he wasn't evil or mean - it is just such a wonderful story.Scrooge got a new lease on life. But he wasn't the only one, he gave to those in need and was the most delightful person. He took up a relationship with his nephew and lived the life he should have been living. And he became a wonderful friend to his employee's family, Bob Cratchit, Tiny Tim and the whole lot. It's bittersweet.Things even changed for Tiny Tim who needed an operation and guess who helped him live =)Scrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more; and to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was a second father. He became as good a friend, as good a master, and as good a man, as the good old city knew, or any other world. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them laugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know that nothing ever happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have their fill of laughter in the onset; and knowing that such as these would be blind anyway, he thought it quite as well that they should wrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive forms. His own heart laughed: and that was quite enough for himMY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List
