I've been on a "books that have been made into movies" kick lately (World War Z is next). I'm also a fan of Ben Peller's previous To Live books, and having read this book all I can say is: THIS BOOK DESERVES TO BE MADE INTO A MOVIE. Shawn Michals, a reluctant hero, chosen by a mysterious woman to spearhead a political revolution that challenges oppression while at the same time awakening in him demons that have long been dormant. What could possibly go wrong? A lot, as it turns out. But a lot goes right, too. Great writing! Definitely worth reading. And no, I don't know Mr. Peller. But judging from his author photo on the back cover, I'd like to. :)
