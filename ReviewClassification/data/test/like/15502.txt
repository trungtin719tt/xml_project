I know 'serious' students of poetry will mock this, but I really think this is a superlative poem and will even say that I believe Coleridge to be a superior poet to Wordsworth. The ballad meter is delightful, and how can one not be won over by things like: "I fear thee, ancient mariner/ I fear thy skinny hand/ For thou art long and lank and brown/ As is the ribbed sea sand." Ew, I mean, can't you just imagine what this guy looks like?Or how about this?"The very deep did rot : O Christ !That ever this should be !Yea, slimy things did crawl with legsUpon the slimy sea."Again, so evocatively gross.One last stanza, maybe my favorite:I closed my lids, and kept them close,And the balls like pulses beat ;For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the skyLay like a load on my weary eye,And the dead were at my feet.I adore that 3rd line. I could just keep putting stanzas up here, but then you won't read it. He's pretty much my idol when I try to write poetry.
