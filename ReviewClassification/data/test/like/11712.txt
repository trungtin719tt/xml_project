This is the story of three sets of characters living in the Appalachians in Virginia. There is a woman biologist, a new wife, a sour old man and a wonderful "nannie".As usual Kingsolver's characters are strong and exciting. Her descriptions of landscapes, animals and insects, etc are so impressive you can be there in your mind.I loved this book and it's intertwining of lives. My only regret is that it wasn't longer.
