One of theDiscworldnovels that doesn't belong to any character sub-series,Small Godsis nevertheless one of the best ones I've read so far.Terry Pratchett was a humanist. That is to say, he wasn't religious. He apparently distinguished between religion (as in: religious institutions such as The Church) and faith (as in: what people believe in their own hearts and minds) and was especially critical of the former. I'm much the same. Personally, I find religion silly, period. It has had its place in the evolution of mankind, surely, but not nowadays. And yet ... look around.I keep hearing people talk about "all the good" this or that person or institution is doing for religious reasons and maybe some are, but they are not the norm and many do it for ulterior reasons anyway (e.g. wanting to get recognition for what they are doing or being afraid of some form of hell or whatever).This and more are points Sir Terry is addressing in this book as well.We meet Brutha, a novice in the temple of the Great God Om. The problem? Well, for starters, Brutha might be honest to a fault and have an impeccable memory but he also just wants peace - which he is unlikely to get to enjoy since he's been chosen as the new Prophet. And then there is the tiny problem of The Great God Om, who is speaking to Brutha, currently being trapped in the body of a cute little tortoise.In a world full of gods and saints and whatnot, with almost everyone believing something else, they have to find a way to restore Om to His Former Glory and, possibly, make things a little better in Brutha's home country and some neighbouring ones as well.Authoritarian systems, the Discworld version of the Inquisition, gods, saints, demons, lions, eagles, philosophers, priests and some mysterious monks safeguarding history. The reader gets a wide cast of characters that are all tragically funny and always spot-on when it comes to condemning (wilfull) ignorance and promoting free will.Pratchett nails it with his snarky and bone-dry observations on religious upbringing (I should know because despite being an atheist/humanist, I was born into a Roman Catholic family). In his signature funny and light way, he shows how these oppressive systems work (often so that those trapped in them don't even realize it). Moreover, he makes valid points such as that either you do nice / good things because you want to and because it's the right thing to do or you shouldn't bother. However, despite all that, the book is never preachy (see what I did there? ;P) or boring. On the contrary, the mad romp through several hitherto unseen countries on the disc was delightful and fast-paced and I was constantly laughing about the clumsiness and bad luck of Om and Brutha.
