An excellent project of retribution and compensation. It broke my heart to pieces in its bloody dark unfair scenes. However, it flushed the happiness in my cheeks of its happy joyful ending scenes. My heart will always remember Silas Marner, Eppie Marner, Godfrey case, and Nancy Lammeter of Raveloe.P.S note:Priscilla (Nancy's sister) is hilarious and I think she is my favorite character in the novel.
