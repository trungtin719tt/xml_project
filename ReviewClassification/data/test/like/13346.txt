WTH? Who ends books like this? What was the point? As if I wouldn't readShadowfeverwithout this awful cliffhanger.Dreamfever's cliffhanger ending really touched my nerve. I was barely able to tolerateFaefever's mid-scene cut-off, mainly because I had the next installment readily available to me, but this time I have to wait for almost 6 months to see what happens! Pardon my language, but that's a fecked up thing to do to the readers!Ok, I am going to calm down now.Dreamfeverstarts whereFaefeverleft off. Mac is in the hands of 3 Unseelie Princes and one unknown entity and is being turned Pri-ya. She is almost dead and finally saved by none other than Dani. Soon Barrons shows up to get a hold of his OOP detector and to administer his special Pri-ya "medicine." He succeeds, and Mac emerges after her ordeal, once again, a changed person. What follows is familiar to us non-stop chase for the Book, the Hallows, the answers, only this chase is more urgent because the world is literally crumbling down under the assault of the Unseelie.Dreamfeveris another very readable book full of excellent lore, mysterious characters and adventure.At the same time this installment caused me more angst than any other book in the Fever series. It is dark, dark, dark. Pri-ya Mac and her "relationship" with Barrons totally depressed me, because I love the two together and simply hated to see them finally get together in such a messed-up way.My other complaints are in tune with those of other readers:- Give me some answers finally! I've read 4 books out of 5 and I still have more questions than answers. How can they all be answered in the last book?- The structure of the last two books in not satisfying. They don't read like separate books and should have been plotted tighter. For instance, Dani's chapters inDreamfeverwere totally unnecessary. Too much plodding around and no sufficient build-up to climaxes. And the cliffhangers!In spite of my complaints, I still enjoyed the book immensely and dying to finally have all my questions answered. I just hope Moning will be able to deliver the ending that will meet all readers' expectations.P.S. It better NOT be Barrons!
