Now,I don't know if I'm in love or if I'm pissed. Oh well, I guess I can beboth, right? RIGHT?I don't know if I should rate it 4, 4.5, 5 stars. No. Idea.Truth to be told, that wasamazing.Meghan, Puck, Razor, Grim, Ash, and all the creepy little bugs and other creatures... You're full of flaws, infuriating, you made me laugh, swoon, yell, cry, hope, dream, smile. I hated you.I love you all.This book is far from flawless, and contrary to many, that's not my favorite (nah, that's the first, I know, I'm a weirdo, blabla). I still found myself completely drawn into that world and it stayed a page-turner for me.Review to come, somehow, when I'll finish all the freakin books of this series, finally finish my work, and sleep. Oh, yes, sleep. What a stranger concept right now.
