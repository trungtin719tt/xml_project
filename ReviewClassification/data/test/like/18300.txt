"Wrinkle" is the most famous, and it certainly grabbed me as a kid--I can remember struggling through at least one hellish day of school, waiting to get home and find out what happened next. But the one I reread most often is "Planet," and I really couldn't say why. The themes in all the books of the series are similar--like Dumbledore, L'Engle believes firmly in the awesome and transformative power of love...Maybe I just really dug the time travel.
