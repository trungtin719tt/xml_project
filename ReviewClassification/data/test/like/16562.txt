Amazing read!You might feel a bit bored of the overly joyous innocence poems, but when you start reading the experience poems, the book becomes perfectly balancedMy favorites were of course in the experience chapter:I loved theClod and the PebbleIt really was the ultimate poem of contrast.'Love seeketh not itself to please,Nor for itself hath any care,But for another gives its ease,And builds a heaven in hell's despair.'So sung a little clod of clay,Trodden with the cattle's feet,But a pebble of the brookWarbled out these metres meet:'Love seeketh only Self to please,To bind another to its delight,Joys in another's loss of ease,And builds a hell in heaven's despite.'The Angelwas one of my favorites as well.I dreamt a dream! What can it mean?And that I was a maiden QueenGuarded by an Angel mild:Witless woe was ne'er beguiled!And I wept both night and day,And he wiped my tears away;And I wept both day and night,And hid from him my heart's delight.So he took his wings, and fled;Then the morn blushed rosy red.I dried my tears, and armed my fearsWith ten thousand shields and spears.Soon my Angel came again;I was armed, he came in vain;For the time of youth was fled,And grey hairs were on my head.
