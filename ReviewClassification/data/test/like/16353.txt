Buddy read with the amazing sisPearl.--&gt; click to read her wonderful review. :)Just a perfect read on a rainy night. There areLOTSof Sydrian moments and I just can't help highlighting and also smiling like an idiot. This is making me a hopeless romantic but I SHIP SYDRIAN SO HARD I HAVE HEART EYES. (Forgive me for fangirling, Adrian Ivashkov is just irresistible.)The Bloodlines seriesjust keeps getting better. I love how Richelle Mead adds more twist on Sydney's adventure as it focuses on two conflicts:a.)Finding Ms. Terwilliger's older sister, Veronica,who absorbs someone's magic to make her stronger and enhance her beauty, leaving the victims in coma and frail. Sydney must prevent her from taking more by protecting them with charms. She learns more defensive and offensive magic (It was badass imo). Adrian's vampire magic protects her more since Veronica couldn't detect it.b.)Meeting an ex-alchemist, Marcus Finch. He reveals that there is a conspiracy in the Alchemy world as they secretly coordinate with the Warriors of Light (Vampire Hunters). He proposed to Sydney on joining their group and as well as break the golden lily tattoo, replacing it with an Indigo ink (which breaks the compulsion).I love Sydney Sage. She might holding back her feelings to Adrian at first, I think it's understandable since she was trained to follow the alchemist beliefs. Seeing her character development is just wonderful. She's becoming more confident, and lets herself do the things according to her will without being controlled or dictates by anyone. I love how she breaks out of her shell.As always,Adrian Ivashkov is the most romantic vampire ever.He's just there for Sydney no matter what, even if it means loving her by afar. (damn you, Syd). omfg! Everything he does here will melt your heart and I WILL NEVER GET ENOUGH OF HIM. That spirit dream...*fans self* Their romance/chemistry is just strong and adorable. Absolutely on point!I am looking forward on the next book. I am nervous and excited at the same time because I can sense some trouble (and more Sydrian moments, haha!). I peek on the next book and it's in dual perspective! I'm a happy fangirl. Richelle Mead is amazing!
