FINALLY!All I am going to say is that Chloe finally picked a guy and it was the one I wanted! Wooohooo! I don't even care what happened in the rest of the book, I just wanted that to happen and it did!First off, I am a huge fan of this series. I love the story, the characters, the world that Armstrong has created. That being said, The Reckoning wasn't my favorite book of the series.That being said, it felt like the plot was going in circles again with the whole Edison group thing. I understand that they are the 'bad guys' and that is who they are running from, but gosh... I need a new angle here or something. Do we have to go there again? The start was a little slow, especially after all that fast-paced energy we had from the last novel. Thankfully it did get better.I was not a fan of the ending. If you can even call it that? I mean the book did end, but the reader doesn't really get any closure. I read the last page and thought... 'that's the end... seriously?' There is just too many questions left unanswered and not nearly enough satisfaction. Fortunately this isn't the end... Armstrong will be continuing the series, unfortunately it's with a new narrator... so no more Chloe, Tori, Simon and Derek.I will keep coming back though, there is something insanely addicting about Armstrong's writing.Overall- fantastic series. The Reckoning wasn't my favorite, but I still couldn't put it down.
