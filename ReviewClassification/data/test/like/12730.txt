"What does true madness care about discovery?"The two main plotsin Living Dead in Dallas are:A)The ruthless Maenad, Callisto, who comes to visit Bon Temps accompanied by her feral razorback pig companion, demanding tribute.B)A member of the Dallas vampire nest has been taken by an anti-vampire organization, The Fellowship of the Sun, with the help of a very old and very suicidal vampire, Godfrey (Godric).This book begins with Sookie discovering a dead body in Sheriff Andy Bellefleur's vehicle, which was left in Merlotte's parking lot overnight (being too intoxicated to drive it home), when she shows up for work. She learns that the victim, her friend and Merlotte's fry cook, Lafayette, had recently attended an exclusive sex party, and feels that the other attendees may know what happened to him, or at the very least provide some clues.Meanwhile, her vampire boyfriend, Bill Compton, informs Sookie that they have been summoned by Eric Northman. Before reaching Fangtasia to speak with the Vampire sheriff of Area 5, Louisiana, Sookie is attacked by Callisto to send a message to the vampires (talk about being the middleman,ouchh!). After being healed, Eric sends them both toDallasto help their local vamp leader, Stan Davis, find out what happened to his missing 'brother' Farrell, who's been MIA for about a week, while Eric tries to solve Bon TempslittleMaenad problem.Sookie Stackhouse has been working on and strengthening her telepathic skills, which prove to be very useful and ultimatelylifesaving. When she meets another telepath (Barry), she learns that she's able to send mental messages to others, instead of just receiving them.Speaking of meeting another telepath, Sookie also meets other supernatural beings, such as other shapeshifters and werewolves who end up helping her out of a few life or death situations.This book wasmuchmore humorous thanDead Until Dark. I laughed out loud quite a few times. I loved all the parts that included Eric (especially the one where he accompanies Sookie to the secret sex party).My big problem with book two is that the murder of Lafayette and the Maenad situation felt...Underdeveloped? Those two mysteries fellflatfor me. Another thing, Bill's character seems a bitboring, and his relationship with Sookie doesn't really excite me like it did in book 1.I know in my review of book 1 I said I would try not to compare the books to the T.V. show,True Blood, but I just can't seem to help myself! Yes, the books did come first, but I watched and fell in love with the show first (I'm sorry!). I was sad that Lafayette was killed off so quickly and we didn't really get to *know* him better in Charlaine Harris' Southern Vampire Mysteries, because he is one of my most favorite characters in the show. Also, Steve and Sarah Newlin (the leaders of the Fellowship of the Sun) aren't written as in depth as they are portrayed in TB. :(
