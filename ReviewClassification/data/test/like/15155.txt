This book was INTOXICATING. I loved every single second of it. While I had gone into this story thinking it was going to be packed with suspenseful scenes, the mystery was really in the storytelling. It was unexpected but executed SOOOO well. A+ use of an unreliable narrator that propelled the story way beyond what I had originally anticipated. Not only was it extremely thrilling and kept me intrigued the entire time, but I seriously appreciated how accurate the representation of alcoholism was. While the events of the story were not necessarily the most "realistic", the many of the characters felt real; like people who could actually exist, who had authentic thoughts and feelings I could see reflected in actual people. It was a fantastic novel and I would highly highly recommend it.
