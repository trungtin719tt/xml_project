As speculative fiction (the alternate world in which Germany and Japan have won WW2 and split up a conquered America between them) and as social commentary (the attitudes embodied by both the conquerors and conquered), Philip K. Dick's The Man in the High Castle hits on all cylinders. The cultural world Dick creates in which vintage Americana items are manufactured and then sold to the occupiers was really interesting. So too were the cultural attitudes that were transferred to the defeated nation, including racial superiority and a shift from democratic values to a belief in totalitarian systems of government. These shifts come easier than we'd like to believe possible, but I think Dick was unfortunately right about that.There were many other details which made this an interesting read. Still, while it was always interesting and even immersive, it lacked a strong plot line that would have added tension and emotional energy. It took a long time before there was any recognizable plot at all. That seems a shame to me because so much worked in The Man in the High Castle. Again, I enjoyed it (and maybe especially so when characters ventured into the desolate Wyoming where I live), but be prepared to engage with the world Dick creates rather than on plot.
