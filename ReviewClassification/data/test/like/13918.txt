I'm currently working my way through this book, which is the standard edition of his collected poetry.Should be done some time in20182019never.Frost in 1941I'm abandoning my reading of Frost's poetry. Too many other books to get read.Having gotten up throughA Witness TreeI'm guessing that I've probably read most of his poems that are still remembered. It was a great journey, I found out a lot about Frost and the surprising poetry that he wrote through most of his long life. A very modern poet, even though in the end I get the impression that he is properly classified as a quiteregionalpoet, one who in much of his work writes of people and attitudes that are found in American New England - that area northeast of New York and even more specifically north of Boston. Vermont, New Hampshire, Maine, and the northern edge of Massachusetts.- - - - - - - - - - - -Below are the nine collections of poetry the book contains, the year the collection was published, and links to separate reviews of the collections, for those I've read and reviewed.
