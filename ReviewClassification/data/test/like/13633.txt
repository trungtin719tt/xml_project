Everyone likes to explore their deeper self occasionally, and one of the best ways I have been able to do this is by reading this book. Lavendar is skillful in constructing the Pandora's Box of emotions with her poetry collection, which has a personal touch on her life, making it quite realistic.The personal nature of the stories makes you feel like hope is up for grabs when faced with a difficult situation. I am sure that the way this book is written will leave a mark on anyone who dares to pick it up. The spiritual and self-discovery themes are outlined in an easy to read manner.I like the way Lavendar uses a rich mix of imagery, such as photographs, to accentuate the inspirational and sensitive stories.
