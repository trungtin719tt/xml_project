As the Goodreads description indicates, this concluding volume of the series sees the epic battle between good and evil, freedom and tyranny, come to its powerfully-depicted, awesome conclusion. But the struggle against Galbatorix isn't the only significant issue here, though it's certainly the central one on which everything else hangs. Win or lose, who will survive the showdown --and who won't? Can the races of Alagaesia learn to live in harmony? What is the future of magic, and of dragonkind? Are Eragon and Arya destined to be together? And have you forgotten the blood debt that Birgit thinks Roran owes her? (Paolini hasn't.) Our author wraps all these strands up here, in a grand tapestry that's as well-written and compelling in the fourth volume as it was in the first; his mastery of style, characterization and world-building has remained remarkably consistent all the way through. (As a result, many of the general comments in my reviews of earlier books in the series apply to this one as well.)It's hard to discuss some of the specific elements here without resorting to spoilers (though readers who know much about my general tastes in fiction will garner some conclusions about the ending from the five-star rating itself! :-) ) But I can say that we get to encounter Galbatorix in person here, and he's a vivid, fully-human character, not just an embodied force of evil (although he is evil) as Sauron, for instance, is in the LOTR series. He's also the kind of tyrant who, at a conscious level, is wholly convinced that he's good for the kingdom and that his opponents are the dangerous bad guys; and he's able to articulate his attitude in rhetoric that's eerily parallel to claims we might hear from politicos who want power over us in the real world. Personally, I give Paolini high marks on both grounds. Moreover, IMO, every aspect of his plotting is excellent; it frequently surprises, and yet you feel, on reflection, that yes, this is exactly the way things needed to happen. He looks unflinchingly at the high cost that doing what's right sometimes carries, and readily affirms that it's worth paying. And he's not afraid to depart from expected convention in the realistic way that his story ends.(view spoiler)[The ending itself is superbly crafted, poignant and powerful --one of the most moving closings to a piece of modern fiction that I've read, with an elegaic, bittersweet quality.(hide spoiler)]A word can be in order here about Paolini's resolution of the debate over theism that's cropped up in places over the course of the four books, since Eragon is directly asked at one point if he believes in the gods. The conversation there arises naturally, and it's a short one (in contrast to the long lecture on the subject that we get at one point inBrisinger). While not embracing the elves' atheism, Eragon's stance remains agnostic and secular; he's not certain that the gods exist, doubts that they care about people, believes morality should be practiced for its own sake, not fear of punishment, and isn't sure he wants immortality (though, as a dragonrider, he's apt to live for centuries). Before Christian readers react too negatively to this, though, it's important to recognize that in the context of his world's pagan polytheism, these aren't unreasonable attitudes. "Gods," in Alagaesia, are entities whose existence is vouched for mostly by nothing more than ethnic traditions (which conflict with each other); they have never acted in verifiable history, never sacrificed or suffered on behalf of people, don't offer an eschatology or teleology, nor a standard for critiquing an unjust social order, and are not supported by anything resembling the body of Christian evidences that exists in the real world. None of the various cults in Alagaesia contribute constructively to the world in any obvious way (that of the priests of Helgrind is obviously pathological). And an embrace of goodness for its own sake, not from fear of punishment, is the whole goal of Christian sanctification. So as a Christian reader, I'm not offended by Eragon's self-distancing from Alagaesian religion. To be sure, Paolini as an author may have no clue (indeed, probably doesn't) that Christianity has any different characteristics than Alagaesian paganism. (We assume that everybody in "Christian" America knows what Christians basically believe; but the reality is that vast numbers of Americans have almost no knowledge of our beliefs.) But for those of us who know that it does, this is both a window into the perceptions of others and a way for us to better understand our own unique faith by contrast --thus better equipping us to communicate the difference.Predicting what works of contemporary literature will stand the test of time is a chancy business. But I'd hazard the guess that Paolini's Inheritance Cycle will be recognized in succeeding centuries (if the world endures) as one of this century's more significant contributions to the fantasy genre.
