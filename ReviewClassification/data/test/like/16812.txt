Wow, this book is one of those bizarre ones. Ben Peller chose to wrap up his "To Live" trilogy with a definite departure from the previous two books. I applaud his courage. Shawn Michals/Ben Peller?) is now Rusty Loury, and on an island where a revolution is brewing. It's well written, confusing at times, but in the end I enjoyed the heck out of it. Am definitely bringing it to school with me, and definitely rereading it.
