Stop it Nabokov, you're making every other writer on this planet look terrible.This novel, which basically rejects every element and characteristic of our common conceptions of "novels", is a masterpiece of form and structure. It is a book made up entirely of footnotes. In the beginning, we are presented with a poem, a 999-line poem calledPale Fire. The "novel" part of this "novel" resides in the commentary and footnotes on this poem.Nabokov constructs an entire narrative, complete with rounded characters and locations, within the line-by-line commentary of the poem. It is wonderful. I cannot sing its praises any higher. Like inLolitawe are introduced to a less than admirable, unreliable narrator Charles Kinbote. Slowly he begins his commentary on his friend's poem,Pale Fire. However, as the footnotes pile up, we stray further and further away from academic citation and we are plunged into Kinbote's megalomaniacal and deranged mind. Like Alice down the rabbit hole, we have nothing to grab and the darkness evades every word.Pale Fireis a true masterpiece. The quintessential anti-novel. Its utter subversion of what we know as literature can only be comparable to Joyce'sUlysses. And likeUlysees, I can say without doubt that this is one of the greatest novels of the 20th Century, if not, all time.
