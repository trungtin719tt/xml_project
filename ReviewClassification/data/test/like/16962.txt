What a clever novel. Brilliant while restrained, meaningful while understated. Delillo is one of the few genius writers who doesn't get carried away with his own genius. He is patient, he doesn't give up the game too soon, he lets the reader guess, sometimes squirm. He is neither cryptic nor obvious.This novel has many themes, and I don't think it would be profitable to try to go through them all. But let's start with the title. What does he mean by that?For me, the key is something that happens near the beginning, in one of the many supermarket scenes. Somebody trips and knocks over a rack of paperback books that spill out all over the floor. So many books that it is difficult to walk.This encapsulates one of the fundamental messages of this book: too much information. Delillo knew that modernity would bring with it ever increasing amounts of data (and this was before the internet). Life would gradually be subsumed under a tidal wave of media - information, tabloids, factoids, television, advertisements, mass-market paperbacks. How is an author supposed to compete with such an onslaught? How can real art - art that requires prolonged concentration in order to appreciate - how can real art exist in such an environment?Delillo tackles this problem in a humorous way. Every other line of dialogue seems to be a half-hearted attempt at profundity. But they almost always miss their mark, intentionally it seems. People are struggling to make sense of their world, but all dialogue is so saturated with information that nothing profound can exist. People are left pondering the greatest questions of life with factoids gleaned from trashy newspapers. The main character discusses his inevitable death with a man who practically worships television ads.In some ways, this novel is more timely now than when it was first published. Many of the trends of modernity Delillo identifies have intensified. But at least this book manages to cut through the white noise.
