Wow! I just did a quick scan of the reviews for this book and they are all over the place from one to five stars. Some people (like me) love it to death, others really hate it and some just sit in the middle. I guess you have to enjoy Fforde's particular sense of humour.This was a reread for me but the last time I read it was so long ago the book, when I dug it off my shelf, had turned a yellowy brown colour. This in no way damaged my reading experience. I still loved the premise of the book which I know is developed into even greater things in the next few books in the series. Thursday Next is a wonderful character and I have a soft spot for Landon and for Pickwick the Dodo.There are many literary references throughout the story which I always enjoy. It has been pointed out that it is a major spoiler for anyone who wants to read Jane Eyre which is funny but also a bit true!Still a five star read for me and now I have read it again I want to carry on and read the rest of them even if they all have yellowy brown pages!
