If you have interest on Greek mythology &amp; love story in it, this book is quite ok. I do enjoy some parts. Can read as standalone I supposed. Every books has different main characters but connected (some) somehow.P/s: OMG! Considering how Julian treat Grace, how can you not love the guy, Penelope? Well, that's your lost. What's done is done. Let the one who knows how to appreciate have him.
