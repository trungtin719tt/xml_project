Superb!This is the first Kipling that I have read and I see why he stands so well and highly acclaimed.These are truly classic stories with longevity and, although they may at first seem ostensibly to be children's stories, they carry many adult themes and subtexts to keep readers of most ages engaged. The irony and/or subtlety of some would be lost on kids whilst others contain darker not so childlike ideas, yet, the man child's adventures amongst the many voiced animals and their lore is the stuff of childhood fantasy and no doubt resonates with every child's seeming love/fear relationship and curious fascination with wild animalsThe introduction to this edition states thatthere is more to the Jungle books...more for the student and reader of rhetoric,...who also 'read' what they read, who are interested, as Kipling was in the art of fiction.At their heart, these short stories; a tapestry of fantasy, fable, natural history and myth, reach a little deeper than mere entertainment does; touching old, even eternal themes, such as salvation, prophecy and vision quest in 'The White Seal,... The Fall from Creation's point of view in 'How fear came',... or the corrupting lust for wealth in 'The King's Ankus'. Woven throughout the Mowgli stories are themes of loyalty, honor, estrangement and self discovery, initiation and rites of passage set against the ever present background and inherent dichotomy born of the tension between social instinct and the primal. It is these tales that form the backbone of these anthologies and like The Brothers Grimm, they have a darker, sinister quality written out of the better known but sanitized Walt Disney interpretation. Mowgli, the man child, is king of the jungle yet not truly animal, totally at home in it and yet inherently alien to it, an animal to the humans and a human amongst the animals; more completely human for his brotherhood with the latter yet always an alien, an outsider, to both worlds. He is a Warrior hero, fully at home in neither human society or the brotherhood of jungle. One whom the animals respectfully fear for his humanity, which for them carries an innate, unspoken truth of superiority and authority, whilst to his own kind, he is is held as demon or a pariah, an unwelcome reminder of their own shadow and hence a threat to their sense of identity. This is all told with such skill, such atmosphere, complexity and credibility (read 'conceptual continuity') that you can all but feel the dappled shade of the jungle, the close damp heat, the racing heart beat of the boy hunter or the sense of silent watchful eyes near but unseen.Magnificent!This edition comes with many notes, illuminating the sources that Kipling used for research and background authenticity and the validity of Indian words and references.
