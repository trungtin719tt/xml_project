I read the series over a couple weeks basically continuously, so I will review it as a whole.I don't have a lot to say, because they're fairly straightforward, highly entertaining thriller novels, and that's ultimately why I admire them so much. The women characters have real depth and agency. While horrible violence against women is indeed depicted in graphic detail, and I understand why some criticize the series for this reason, I am glad that at least the books' message is firmly against misogynistic violence. Lisbeth Salander is someone whom I can relate to while simultaneously being way cooler and more mysterious than I could ever dream to be.My main complaint with these books is that(view spoiler)[Kalle Fucking Blomkvisthas sex with nearly every woman character in the trilogy.(hide spoiler)]In fact, I don't know how to read Blomkvist's character as anything but a male fantasy. That, and I find it slightly irritating yet hilarious how often the characters indulge in cigarettes, coffee, and sandwiches.(view spoiler)[When Blomkvist broke into Salander's secret apartment inThe Girl Who Played With Fireand promptly brewed coffee and prepared sandwiches I couldn't stop myself from cracking up.(hide spoiler)]Good, entertaining books, not too dense. Very entertaining.(view spoiler)[I'm glad we got a happy ending.(hide spoiler)]
