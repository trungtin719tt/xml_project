I realized recently that I never reread Sherlock Holmes. I received collected SH for Christmas when I was nine, and read it all (with the exception of Hound of the Baskervilles, which I skipped at the time because I was afraid it might involve bad things happening to dogs) over vacation. I enjoyed the stories very much but at this point only remember colorful details and quirky solutions -- some orange seeds, a secret snake, men with red hair, different colors of mud.I don't know what happened to that nice hardbacked volume of my childhood. I certainly haven't seen it since leaving for college. For this reread I got the Everyman edition from the library. The previous borrower had also checked out Shirley Jackson (Hill House, Richard Matheson (Hell House) and three books on raising chickens. She ordered all those, they weren't the result of casual browsing. I guess if you're raising chickens you need some thrilling reads.I can see why this held such appeal to Victorians. Smart, yet not difficult, not exclusive to those with less education. Yes, there are some classical allusions, but if you don't get them the story still makes sense. It's not like some English lit with important dialog in French. (I love you, Dorothy Sayers, but really?) And the long Mormon flashback section was probably quite exotic at the time, although I could've done without it.Once I started, it turned out that I mostly did remember the plot, but I still enjoyed this and look forward to more rereading.
