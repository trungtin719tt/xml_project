As soon as I finished 'Quantum Roots' by Kyle Keyes, I was straight onto getting the sequel 'Quantum Roots II: Worm Holes'. I enjoyed the first in the series so much, thanks to the brilliant addition of a quantum physics threat in the plot, that I had high hopes for the second installment. Thankfully, 'Worm Holes' lived up to its predecessor, and to my delight had even more illuminating and fascinating scientific elements.In this installment, Olan Chapman is once again round his energy recycled to another body, that of Samuel Leroy McCoy back in 1876. Once again he finds himself on the run from the powers that be, will he come through this new adventure unscathed?A great read that I highly recommend to any fan of adventure, action, or sci-fi novels.
