Oh boy. I picked this one up on a whim today as it's been sitting on my shelf for ages and I was in the mood for a good cry, seeing as our pending move is getting extremely close. This book brought me back to 2008 when my mom was diagnosed with stage 2 breast cancer, then after 3 months turned to stage 4 with a death sentence. (I'll have you know cancer's ass got beat and she's still in remission after almost 9 full years) Cancer books are always hard for me to read, which I think is why I put this one off for so long, but suffice it to say, I'm glad I picked it up. I'm not sure what I could possibly say that hasn't been said yet about this book, but it was wholly moving and by far the richest book I've read in years. Highly recommended for the right time. I may come back and add more thoughts if I process through it a bit more.
