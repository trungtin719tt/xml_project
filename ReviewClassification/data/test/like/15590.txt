Holy alien babies everywhere,I can't decide whether I want tokissorkillJennifer L. Armentrout!I'm stressed and excited and scared and giddy and I can't turn off these emotions that threaten to drown me!Just give me the next book!By New Year's Day,you'll have admitted that you're madly,deeply,irrevocably,and irresistibly in love with me.While Daemon seemed sure that Kat would admit her feelings towards him,she tried to convince herself and everyone else that those feelings were nonexistant and that Daemon's decision to pursue her was the result of the creepy alien bond they shared.And that conviction cascaded a parade of badbaddecisions,from starting dating someone else (even though is was brief and sabotaged by Daemon) and playing ninja on her own to training with a dubious boy to explore her recently developed super powers and keeping secrets from the people she loved.Add her mom's new boyfriend,the DOD's sudden interest in her,curious disappearances,coincidences that were not coincidences and some huge revelations about alien mutations and that's it,Katy was not (could not be) the same person anymore.I could always give you a teaser.You bookish people love teasers, don't you?Well,I can give you a teaser as well.Onyxwas an intriguing,action-packed,bite-your-nails-out-of-agony,sizzling-romance-that-makes-your-toes-curl,ravish-Daemon novel.JLA does not fail to surprise you,she could fill you with hope and then leave you desparate and speechless,make your heart beat frantically and then abruptly stop.Secretsandschemesrelated to the government held you captivated,and moments ofanguishandpainwere inevitable.Thetensionbetween Daemon and Kat was off the charts,but there was also something else brewing between them.Something warm and fuzzy,a deep connection that had nothing to do with the alien bond.Something tender and beautiful.I would've kept you safe.Onyx made me love Daemon even more.He knew the error of his ways,he tried to show Kat the magnitude of his feelings and even though she denied him,he was there,looking for her,never giving up.He's justperfect.Andhot.Let's not forget that.Words were the most powerful tool.Simple and so often underestimated.They could heal.They could destroy.Words.Katy could simply use words and everything would be different.It keeps happening,when I like a female character,she does something incrediblystupid.It's like Kat was asking me to smash her head or hand her to the Arum!She trusted the wrong people,she hurt Daemon and Dee and out of pure stubborness she did the exact opposite of what she was told.At least she stopped being a bystander,and she was driven by the urge to protect those close to her,she didn't want to be a damsel in distress,and she finally put herself together in the end.After I plotted a dozen ways to murder her and throw myself at Daemon.If there is anything, there is us.You and me. No one else.(Can you blame me for singingFell in love with an alien?)
