Most of this book was incredibly well-crafted. Dubus is exceptional at two things: 1) making real life struggles feel like a page-turner and 2) creating characters that alternate between likeable an unlikable, hero and villain. These two things make the book worth reading. But the book also has one huge flaw: the trigger for the plot is unrealistic and makes the main character unsympathetic throughout. Still recommended but at the expense of my suspension of disbelief.
