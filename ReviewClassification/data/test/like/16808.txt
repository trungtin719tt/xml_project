This book, the third in Ben Peller's "To Live" trilogy, was the most challenging and the most enlightening. Shawn Michals has morphed into Rusty Loury and who knows where Peller fits in. Enter Bina, a mysterious and amazing woman who is ready to lead a generation. Romance, rediscovery and growth follow, and in the end this tale is one that begs worth not only a read, but rereading. Well done, Peller!
