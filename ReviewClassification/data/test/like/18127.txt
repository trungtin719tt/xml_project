This is one of my all time favorite movies, I constantly asked myself, "How have I never read this book?" Finally, I gave in to the Owens women...Oh, this book was all that I wanted from this story. Completely different from the movie and a strong focus on the two main ladies- Sally and Gillian. Two sisters quickly orphaned and raised by their Aunts (two of my very favorite characters in this book!). The neighborhood in Massachusetts took every opportunity to make fun of these sisters as they had a spooky aura surrounding them. After watching helpless women show up at the Aunts' back doorstep looking for help in the love department- they vowed never to fall in love. Gillian ran away to explore the world and Sally finally gave in and fell in love with the carpenter in town. She had two beautiful girls- Antonia and Kylie. You know how the story goes, but ultimately what makes this book drastically different from the movie is it's focus and the only slightly magical pieces thrown into the narrative.The writing was wonderful and the mini magical elements thrown in really hooked me. I appreciated the character development and am looking forward to Hoffman's newest novel, The Rules of Magic. This might be my favorite magical family-- right up there with the Waverly sisters.
