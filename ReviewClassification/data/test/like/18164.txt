OK, people, I'm officially in tears. When you slowly savor a book like this for a month as I have, the characters' fates mean something to you. Pound for pound, sentence for sentence, word for word, I've not read a more profound book in all my days, I think. The sentences sing and pulse and it's bright and rich and life affirming with robust characters and a real journey of discovery. This one is now near the top of my favorite books list. Countless times I wanted to mark a nugget of wisdom for later reference, but instead opted to continue wending my way through. There will be time for marking, some day. I adopted Zorba's philosophy of life, I chose to live it rather than fixate on categorizing or trying to contain what I was reading in some mathematic way. This book addresses life and its mysteries and how we can chose to live it. That's all I'm going to say. It is one of the masterpieces of world literature. 'Nuff said.
