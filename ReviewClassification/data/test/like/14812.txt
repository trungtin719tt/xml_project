I have a short attention span and, thus, have a hard time reading books by people like, say, Steinbeck or Hardy, where the scenery becomes a character...meaning there are endless passages describing meadows and livestock. However, I loved this book, and, it could be argued, that it has some of that atmospheric quality. I once gave a presentation to a group of women about books I recommend for book groups, and when I mentioned this one, one of the old women - let me say this again, she was OLD and shouldn't be this rude - raised her hand and said, "You're not honestly going to recommend 'How 'Dry' was My Valley' are you?" Yes, chickie, yes I am.... So, I am apparently immune to any boring passages in what I think is a gorgeous and gripping read.
