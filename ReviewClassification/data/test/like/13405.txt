I threw this book across the room, and then I picked it back up, held it at arms length, and shook my head at it. And then I thought about the way it held me in suspense, how it kept the kids in my teen book group reading and thinking, and I dusted it off and gave it a hug. Markus Zusak, you bastard!What has me reacting like a schizophrenic? Why, I can't tellYOU. That would spoil the book for you, and you reallyshouldread it. The basic plot is, a guy stops a bank robbery, gets written up in the local paper, and then gets a mysterious message in the mail. It's the ace of hearts, I think, and with it is three addresses. No explanatory note, nothing.He checks out the addresses, and at each one, there's a situation that needs some help. A girl runner needs encouragement, an immigrant family needs some Christmas cheer, a woman is being abused by her husband.Now, this guy is just a cab driver with no ambition, so he doesn't really want to get involved... but it turns out, he doesn't have much choice. And, there are 3 more aces to go.Intrigued? Hope so.
