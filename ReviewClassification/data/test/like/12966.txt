The rhyming and tongue twisters are a great way to introduce young readers to the way that words can be used. The illustrations of weird and wonderful creatures are whimsical and a great way for children to use their imagination. Being presented with creatures that are not real can sometimes be a challenge for younger readers, but I believe that this can a great way to start conversations with children about the characters. Finding out what they think these creatures might be, what they do, how they make them feel.All in all a fantastic book for readers both young and old.
