One of the most inspiring people in the world would be Helen Keller. Born blind and deaf and lucky to have survived, she soon was able to fluently communicate and rise over her disabilities. It wasn't easy considering that the people of the century she lived in were often ignorant, but she proved to be a very talented individual. Her story is amazing and an interesting read, too.
