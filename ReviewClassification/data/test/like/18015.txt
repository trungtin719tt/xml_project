Disturbing story. Disturbing characters. This book will make you feel uncomfortable, that's what Gillian Flynn does best!I'm not sure I loved it but it's definitely the best written thriller I've read so far this year... still only getting 3.5 stars though!I did suspect the right people but the twists were still... well disturbing!
