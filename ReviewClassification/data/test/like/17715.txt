Science Fiction and Fantasy are two of my favourite genres of fiction, so it is great to see them both combined in 'The Awakening' by Suzanne Boisvert. There is definitely a sense of darkness in this novel that simmers under the surface from the very beginning. There is a malevolent, ancient force in outer space that is planning to return to Earth from which he was banished thousands of years earlier. This evil force, named Sar, is after his lost love, but he also has more insidious plans in mind for Earth too. Throughout the novel, we meet a number of interesting characters, who whilst going on with their everyday lives, feel like there is more to the world and to themselves than what other people see. They begin to sense that danger something catastrophic is coming to Earth that may just end the human race once and for all. Can these unique individuals make their voices heard and do what it takes to change the fate of the human race?A great read with plenty of plot twists and characters that are interesting and likeable. I couldn't put this book down, I just needed to know where the plot was going to go next. There are so much action and excitement, how could there not be when we are facing the end of the world.
