I actually want to read this book so badly, it hurts!I am so excited- when I heard that Dan Brown was releasing a new book, I screamed so loud that another girl on my floor ran into my room and thought I was getting attacked!Brown is probably my top favourite author and I have loved each book that stars Robert as the main character. I loved 'The Lost Symbol' so much!! I have really high hopes for this next one :)Update:Now that I have finished the book, I can say that it was a pure joy to read. Once again, Brown was able to create a mysterious and thrilling adventure. The way he combines the past with such a modern/futuristic twist that gives the story a real 'umph', flawless. This story returns back to Europe, centring around Florence and Italy. Without any spoilers, it had a lot to do with (obviously) Dante's Inferno and his Divine Comedy (a triad of epic-poems that had to do with Hell). I feel like with his fourth instalment of Langdon's Misadventures, he focuses a bit more on the history, backstory and architecture of Florence than his last book, The Lost Symbol. Perhaps because Europe has a deeper art and religious history than the United States, but it was nice to learn as well as enjoy a story. Since I am only 18, sometimes the information was a bit overwhelming but it, in my opinion, didn't take away from the story. The story itself was wonderfully constructed with an ending that gave me a lot to think about. I won't say more, least I give away something I didn't mean to, but I will say this: This book is a worthwhile read and an instant classic for those who have read Dan Brown before. My only question is this- if Brown decides to write another book, how will he top this?
