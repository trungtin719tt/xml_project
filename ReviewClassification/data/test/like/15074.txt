Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry is a fictional story about the Logan family who are African Americans living during the 1930s depression in Mississippi. The plot is narrated by Cassie, the daughter of the Logan family. Each of the events in the plot teaches Cassie the importance of owning land and that the sacrifices to maintain that ownership are worth the struggles because of the freedom the land gives the family. The plot also speaks of the injustices done to African Americans during the time. The story reads as a bildungsroman as Cassie learns and grows from the experiences told in the novel. Overall, I enjoyed the book. I thought the characters were portrayed well, especially the children. I also enjoyed the language of the book because it mimicked the way people would have talked. The events, particularly the ending, were intriguing and pushed the reader to read more. My main complaint about this novel is that sometimes the pacing was really slow. In particular, the beginning of the story moved slowly for me and it was not until the end that I really became riveted and had to read more. Overall, I liked the book and would recommend it to students in middle school.
