Whew. That was long.There was quite a time lapse between my reading of this one and the first one, which can be attributed solely to the length of these books.750+ fucking pages, people. Don't get me wrong, I've read some long books in my decades of dedicated reading, but still...quite the commitment, no?But enough about the completely self-evident length of this book, which - being that this is a Brandon Sanderson book - is a surprise to no one.I adored book one in this series.ADORED it.Like, we are talking first rate adoration here, my friends. The slap this thing on my tops reads of all time shelf and spend the ensuing year trying to force my dad to read it level of adoration.It also left me with quite the book hangover in the form of the complete and utter devastation a reader only experiences when (don't click this if you haven't read book one yet. It will wreck the utter wonder of that book for you.)(view spoiler)[I'm serious.(view spoiler)[Last chance.(view spoiler)[one of your favorite characters of ALL time gets killed off. I still miss you Kelsier, my love. *wipes tear*(hide spoiler)](hide spoiler)](hide spoiler)]AKA shit goes down.You can find my review for book oneHERENeedless to say, my expectations for this were high, folks.And, while I'm not saying this book didn't...deliver...I will say that it didn't hold mequiteas spellbound as book one.This one had a lot of politics and bureaucracy which really bogged the beginning and middle of the story down. There was a lot less action and a lot more contemplation - in the form of "does he love me?" teenage angst variety, which I didn't love - than the first book, which also made the story trudge along in certain areas.Other than that though, the middle/ending really picked up and I enjoyed it immensely.Book three promises to be EPIC.I just hope I don't drag my feet getting to it.
