Author Tim Butcher's books might best be described as a mixture of travelogue, history and politics. He has also developed a theme of following the footsteps of past journeys undertaken by historical figures. In the remarkable "Blood River" he followed Henry Morton Stanley through the Congo whilst in "Chasing the Devil" it was Graham Greene through Sierra Leone and Liberia. In "The Trigger" he is on the trail of Gavrilo Princip, whose assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria-Hungary was in every sense the "trigger" for WWI, although of course the actual causes of the War were more complex.Princip was only 19 when he carried out the murder of the Archduke and his wife -(the author memorably describes him as "history's ultimate teenage troublemaker") - and perhaps because of the limited material relating to Princip's life, the author intersperses that story with his own memories of the Bosnian War of about 20 years ago, which he covered as a young War Reporter. On the whole I felt this was the weaker element of the book. It would of course have been impossible for any author to write of a journey through Bosnia without covering the War, but in Europe the Bosnian War received massive media coverage, and I didn't feel as if this book provided me with any fresh insight into the events of that time. In that respect it compares poorly with "Blood River" which I found to be very thought-provoking and full of unexpected insight.It was the section of the book that dealt with Princip's life that I personally found much the most interesting. Previously all I knew about Princip was his name, his nationality and the deed for which he became notorious. The author follows the journeys Princip himself made from the tiny village in NW Bosnia where he grew up (where he discovers some of his relatives still live), to Sarajevo and then to Belgrade. In undertaking the journey he paints a convincing picture of the young man's gradual radicalisation, showing for example how the school grades of an initially high achieving student declined as he increasingly absented himself from school to become involved in politics. Tim Butcher shows how Princip and his fellow conspirators were mainly motivated by their feeling that the poverty and backwardness of Bosnia was due to its long history of foreign occupation, firstly by the Ottoman Empire, which by the 19th Century had become completely decrepit, and after 1878 by the almost equally ramshackle Empire of Austria-Hungary, who when they occupied Bosnia promised modernisation but who failed markedly to deliver, so much so that the author illustrates that when Princip was arrested, the standard Austrian police form for recording a suspect's details included the typed pro-forma question "To Whom Does This Serf Belong?" This was a part of Europe a mere 100 years ago!One aspect the author argues convincingly was that Princip was a "Yugoslav" rather than a Serb nationalist, to the extent that during his time in Belgrade he was accused of not being a true Serb, a remark that clearly stung the young Princip. Actually Princip comes through in the book as someone who was unusually sensitive to what others thought of him. He seems to have been considered something of a physical weakling and at least part of his motivation for the assassination may have been a desire to prove that he was not weak or cowardly.The last section of the book covers the assassination itself and I was surprised by just how many myths have been printed in history books about that day's events. Credit must go to Mr Butcher for researching this thoroughly and for correcting a number of erroneous accounts that have been published in the past.At a more detailed level I would probably have given this book about 3.8 out of 5, so I have rounded up rather than down. Definitely worth reading if you are interested in the period, and that very rare thing - a "different" angle on the beginning of WW1.
