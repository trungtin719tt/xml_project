Okay, I don't often write reviews, because as an author I always feel weird giving a critical opinion of other authors' work. I think it's because I sort of feel like other authors are my coworkers, all of us working and writing to make people fall in love with reading, so who am I to publicly say what is or isn't right?But I can't help myself in this case. I feel rather as though I fell as inexplicably and inextricably under this book's spell as its characters fall under Fire's. I had no chance against its beauty! And now I have to shout my love from the rooftops.To be honest, for the first few chapters I rolled my eyes every five minutes, because seriously, who gets away with writing about a heroine who is objectively the most beautiful woman in the world, one of a kind, loved and desired by everyone who meets her, blessed with fiery red hair and gifts for music and archery and horseback riding, and--to top it off--able to control the thoughts and feelings of those around her? It seemed like the epitome of Mary-Sue-ness.Yet, I kept reading. I told myself it was out of devotion to the first book, but really, I couldn't have stopped myself.The writing is beautiful, and Fire herself is at the same time so damaged and SO strong, that I fell completely head over heels. Finishing this book was heart-breaking, truly--and it's been ages since I met characters I was so loathe to leave when the book ended. I honestly spent the entire last 100 pages of the book just sobbing wildly off and on until I finished.I swore up and down when I finished reading GRACELING that it was impossible for me to like the sequels better. Kristin Cashore has made a liar out of me. I wish there was a sixth star for me to give this book.And if someone doesn't give me BITTERBLUE pretty much IMMEDIATELY, I may have to start taking hostages.
