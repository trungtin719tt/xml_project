Do you remember the feeling you get when you watch the sun rise or set?Do you remember the feeling you get when you're so happy that you felt like flying?Do you remember the feeling you get when you're so sad and alone that you felt like curling yourself into a ball and wishing you never had to move on?Do you remember the feeling you get when you're so mad that you don't know why your mad?Do you remember the feeling you get when you wished you knew the mysteries of life?Well, this book brought up all those feelings. I don't know what to say about this book. There are tons of emotions warring inside me. So many that I cannot even state them.Aristotle and Dante Discover the Secrets of the Universeis beautiful. The Universe is you. You need to discover yourself. And that was what this book was about. Discovering one's true self."Someday, I'm going to discover all the secrets of the universe."
