Nicholas Sparks does it again withA Bend in the Road. This book is about a police sheriff named Miles Ryan, who lost his wife Missy in a hit and run car accident three years ago. He has a seven-year-old son named Jonah, who has been suffering nightmares ever since the incident. One afternoon Miles has to go see Jonah's teacher for a parent-teacher conference. Jonah's teacher is the sweet and of course single Sarah Andrews who has recently gone through a heart-breaking divorce. They hit if off and soon they are falling in love.I enjoyedA Bend in the Road. Although it was like a typical romance novel - fluffy, sweet, and has characters that are characterized entirely by their past heartbreak, it was still a good book. Sparks writing style doesn't utilize overly excessive romance terms, and is concise and to the point. The mystery was actually intriguing and the development of Jonah was cute. I just wish it was a little more original.
