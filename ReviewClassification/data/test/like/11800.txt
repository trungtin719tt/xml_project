I remember reading this book a long time ago and I suddenly started to remember it today. I remember that it made my heart ache, and it made me cry so much. Nicholas Sparks does have a way with his stories and I am glad that I gave him a try once upon a time. The ending was extremely sad... so if you're into romances with happy endings, I don't think this book is for you. But if you're into romances with heartbreaking moments and an ending that will have your heart cry out, then you should definitely try this book out.I'm probably going to try to re-read this one again, just for a more thorough review, so be right back with this one!
