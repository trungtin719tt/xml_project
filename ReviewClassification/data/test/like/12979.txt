Words of Radianceis an absolutely marvelous continuation of theStormlight Archiveseries.As many of you know, it gets harder to review books in a series the further you get away from the first book. Here I am at the end of only book 2 &amp; already over 2000 pages into this series (or over 80 hours in my case) and there is justsoooo muchhhh storyyyy!So naturally, it's tough to write a review without any spoilers BUT HERE I GO BECAUSE I CARE ABOUT ALL OF YOU!So one of the things I appreciate most about Sanderson's style is how he unfolds the stories he chooses to tell. No matter the scope, there's always arealistic scattering of situationsthat serve to grow the main characters in a way that feelsvery natural.There's always a reliably steady build toward the culmination of events.Circumstances are not contrived, and I never have to worry about the author telling me how I should feel about his characters without alsoshowingme why. Dialogue is realistic, and I am especially fond of how much humor Sanderson worked into this installment. I've heard whisperings of those who think Sanderson's dialogue is cheesy, but I'm a real fan of quick witted banter &amp; puns &amp; so aparticular scene in the chasms really warmed my heart.I found myself extremely engaged with the Interludes for this installment. The Interludes inWords of Radiancedid a far superior job of developing the fringes of the story than inThe Way of Kings. It grows the span of the realm &amp; makes me feel like I'm reading about a real place with real people &amp; real conflicts that don't always wrap themselves up into neat, solvable packages.As a whole, this series strikes anice balance between politics &amp; magic,but I felt as though the politicking was a bit lacking in this novel. Thankfully, this is mostly made up for by two elements:1. How strongly the Interludes contribute to the developing political atmosphere of Roshar.2. The captivating expansions of the magic system in relation to our main characters.Some of the lack has to do with Dalinar's POV being almost entirely absent. The novel switches back &amp; forth between Kaladin &amp; Shallan 99% of the time, and so we are largely excluded from Dalinar's part in the political game outside of brief snatches of his interactions with those two.Speaking of POV's, the unbalance here is something I mentioned inmy reviewofThe Way of Kings, but after readingWords of RadianceI think it's something I have come to terms with. It was difficult for me to spend over a thousand pages without Dalinar, as he is my favorite character. But I think Sanderson is expressing this story in the way that makes the most logical sense, and if that means spending 100 pages with Kaladin, then that's what it means.Long story short, I was a lot less bothered this time around because I've come to expect Sanderson will spend the time he deems necessary with each character &amp; after all the time I've spent in the Cosmere universe,I will just trust him.Now we come to one of my absolute favorite elements of this novel, the action/battle scenes.They're just so energizing &amp; exciting to read!Specifically I think a lot of us are impressed by the scene we've affectionately dubbed "Honor Is Dead."Damn, friends.When I first listened to this scene, I had to stop my car on the side of the road just so I could completely lose myself in it. There is literally no word more appropriate for it thanbadass.This scene is surrounded by many more action sequences, all of which help my rapt attention. I love reading Sanderson's combat, especially because it gives me the opportunity to see how beautifully he works in his own magic systems.The experience is like a dance.Overall, small hang ups on POV's &amp; politics do not weigh enough to influence how much I enjoyed this story. That's a huge part of Sanderson's appeal as a fantasy writer -his stories are consistently satisfying, unique, and a hell of a lot of fun.I'm very specifically planning out when I will pick upOathbringer, because once I finish I will have finished all I have left to read of the Cosmere. I want to wait a couple of months before I dive in because I want to savor every moment of that book when I get to it (plus I hear there's quite a lot of Dalinar so I'm more than ready for that!)Now before I close this review I want to mention something spoilery. Please do not read past this point if you haven't read this series!***SPOILERS BELOW***Alright so Jasnah...Not for one second did I believe that she was dead &amp; I'm actually really surprised the rouse of her death carried on for thewhole book!It was stressing me out how long it took her to show back up because she was just way too important to be taken down at the hands of an assassin &amp; I was worried Sanderson may wait untilOathbringerto bring her back around.Jasnah is, in my estimation, the best female character of the series &amp; so when she finally makes a reappearance I was more annoyed than relieved because I couldn't believe she was also kept out of this story for so long. Every time Shallan &amp; Navani had an interaction over Jasnah's death, I just rolled my eyes. This obviously isn't a huge deal, I just wanted to rant about it for a moment!
