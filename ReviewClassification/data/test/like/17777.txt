Mac Version 2.0Mac has started to change, she originally was that southern Barbie girl who loved pink, cute accessories and fab nail polish.That girl is still inside her battling with the new Mac she is becoming. Why is she changing? Because every time she turns around someone is either lying to her or some Fae petunia-hole is trying to kill her.Then we have Jerrico Barrons. He tries my nerves a bit in this book...and then in the last 50 or so pages-I get hooked.The tension between him and Mac finally really heats up.Moning really writes the sexual tension part very well. It's really not a cheesey as my barbies portray. It's fecking hawt.This book did start slowly because it contains a whole lot of filler for what is to come, and it's not the greatest series that ever lived...but it is one of the ones that are just pure fun.And what becomes of our girl Mac? She starts to grow some big ole balls.
