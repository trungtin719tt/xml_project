I find it amazing that so many reviewers feel the same way that I do. I first read this book many years ago, and pick it up to re-read every so often. It's a simple read and yet it takes me a long time to get through it -- there are so many profound, insightful observations that I set the book aside and think about it. I feel so empowered by some sections. I actually learned how to float on my back after reading the chapter about walking on water! I just walked into the lake and did it (float on my back, that is, not walk on water). I, too, have purchased several copies and loaned them out to friends. I always seem to run across the book when I am seeking answers in my life. While the book holds no answers per se, re-reading it helps me to focus on what I really need and how to go about getting it.
