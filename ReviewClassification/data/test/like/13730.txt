Magnificent, spectacular... I somehow always feel I must assign many types of superlatives to the magnificent &amp; spectacular Edith Wharton! Definitely top ten writers of ALL TIME contender. Her best is "Age of Innocence," and her not-as-much (personally, alas) is "House of Mirth", but sandwiched between them is this tense novella about the restrictions of "unconventional" feeling. And it has the type of invigorating force that compels the reader to do his one job and do it good. I adore this slim tome, admire Wharton for being absolutely angelic in her rare &amp; immense perfection.
