I kind of ruined this for myself having already seen the film. Despite this, the book was suspenseful and exciting - I really believed the unreliable narrator and thought it was incredible how the story unraveled and then twisted at the end. Each character was mysterious with both protagonistic and antagonistic qualities - I was never sure who was on the right or wrong side if there even were sides and who to trust - much like the main character felt I imagine. I got right into the heart of the story and even I wanted to escape that island by the end!I was still left with some questions after I finished, but I guess that comes with the territory of a great mystery/thriller.
