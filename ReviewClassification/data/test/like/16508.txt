I just couldn't stop reading this book. Something different is happening on every page, I was turning them like crazy. When I was young, before the wife and the kids, I wanted to do this. I wanted to walk away from the street I lived on, I wanted to make a life just like I imagined it could be. But I didn't have the guts. Instead I got the wife and the kids and the house and the job. Don't get me wrong. I love my family. But what would have happened if I just walked away? Wish I knew. Now I'm too damned old to find out.
