'Something Wicked This Way Comes' is a glorious read, a smooth creation of poetic prose mixed together so wonderfully I was as delighted as if I had bitten into a honey-filled buttery scone. The story is also an adorable panegyric about a small-town childhood and male bonding which had me in tears at several points.Oh, wow, why can't more fathers understand how familial sentiment is rewarding and beautiful, especially between a father and his son? Age is barely a barrier between a boy and his father, if a father remembers and encourages the explorations and thrills of discovery for a boy reaching out into the world, yet stands near enough to safely catch his eager child while he is running blindly into a future of tests and trials.I have to take a moment here, gentle reader.Ok. My eyes are again clear. :' )The novel is actually a 1962 tale of Halloween horror about a traveling carnival which sets up tents and rides in early October next to a little town where 13-year-old William Halloway and James Nightshade live next door to each other. Born one minute apart, one on the night before Halloween and the other on Halloween, the two boys have spent every spare minute of their lives together, exploring the mysteries hidden in every natural cranny and wild space around town. They will be fourteen in days. Will is enjoying every moment of his life but thinks about things carefully, while Jim chaffs at needing to wait to grow up, impulsive, barely able to wait for his adventures to begin.A whiff of cotton candy foretells the arrival of Cooger &amp; Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show, a circus and carnival in one!The boys run, eager to see the show arrive by train! But things are very odd right at the start. For one thing, the circus arrives in the dead of night and as they watch, the tents seem to set themselves up almost without human agency! There are men moving about, but in total silence. An eery wind blows a creepy balloon about as well as the tents - and then the wind disappears, along with the men and the balloon. Things are very weird about this circus, but after meeting the peculiar people in the carnival in the following days, the kids soon know it is evil. After they notice some of their neighbors have disappeared or seem to have been transformed into creatures, several of the circus' folk come after them, apparently meaning to do them harm.Who can they tell? Who will believe them? Frantic, they finally explain things to Will's father, Charles Halloway. He is the library's janitor and a very good man, wise to the ways of boys. Well-read, he believes them. But can the three of them rescue the missing townspeople and save themselves? As the scary threats become obvious attacks, the trio search books about ancient magic and black witchcraft. Will any of it help them?Examples of Bradbury's miraculous wordplay:"Why are some people all grasshopper fiddlings, scrapings, all antennae shivering, one big ganglion eternally knotting, slip-knotting, square-knotting themselves? They stoke a furnace all of their lives, sweat their lips, shine their eyes and start it all in the crib.""Yetthistrain's whistle!The wails of a lifetime were gathered in it from other nights in other slumbering years; the howl of moon-drenched dogs, the seep of river-cold winds through January porch screens which stopped the blood, a thousand fire sirens weeping, or worse! The outgone shreds of breath, the protests of a billion people dead or dying, not wanting to be dead, their groans, their sighs, burst over the earth!""In front of the United Cigar Store on this before-noon Sunday with the bells of all churches ringing across here, colliding with each other there, showering sound from the sky now that the rain was spent, in front of the cigar store the Cherokee wooden Indian stood, his carved plumes pearled with water, oblivious to Catholic or Baptist bells, oblivious to the steadily approaching sun-bright cymbols, the thumping pagan heart of the carnival band. The flourished drums, the old-womanish shriek of calliope, the shadow drift of creatures far stranger than he, did not witch the Indian's yellow hawk-fierce gaze. Still, the drums did tilt churches and plummet forth mobs of boys curious and eager for any change mild or wild, so, as the church bells stopped up their silver and iron rain, pew-stiffened crowds became relaxed parade crowds as the carnival, a promotion of brass, a flush of velvet, all lion-pacing, mammoth-shuffling, flag-fluttered by."Ray Bradbury, I wish I could kiss you!
