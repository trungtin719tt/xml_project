Wow! I loved the ending of this book. I especially loved the birth scene. It was funny, touching, and made me cry. Finally! Jamie has a grandson that's truly his own. Someone to help make up for the loss he's suffered in being denied the opportunity raise his own children. If anyone deserves lots of grand-babies, it's Jamie.I love Lord John in this book. He kinda became my hero. Shocking, I know, considering how much I disliked him in the last book. He's charming, witty, and very sweet in this story, and I love the relationship between him and Bree. Their characters had such great chemistry. And I don't mean sexually. Lol.Roger is such a wonderful character. My heart broke, then ached for him in this story. I hope the next book is kind to him. He deserves some happiness.Drums of Autumnfelt different from the previous three books. There was a gradual shift in the storyline, from Jamie and Claire, to their posterity. In many ways, Jamie and Claire's story end withVoyager. They were finally reunited and for good. So I'm grateful Mrs. Gabaldon has continued to write about these wonderfully complex characters. Allowing us to find out what happens, not only to Jamie and Claire, but to the people they love.I liked this book. A lot. I'm looking forward to reading the next.
