I'm a big fan of survival books. This one exceeded my hopes. It wasn't just a matter of facing danger or beating the odds, it was a woman freeing herself from what our society expects of a female. She began as Mrs. Warner and she became Molly Brock. It was better than climbing a mountain or sailing solo around the world. It was the survival of not just the body, but the spirit. It's made me think of walking away.
