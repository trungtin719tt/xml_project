Within the pages of this 1869 Classic sci-fi adventure, you will experience life underwater aboard the amazing submarine Nautilus encountering gigantic sea monsters, a 600 pound oyster shell with a flawless Pearl the size of a coconut, and fight your way thru man-eating Sharks as well as the Great Ice Barrier. While the story is a little"heavy"on the descriptions of the colorful fish and unusual plant life, there are also sea battles and shipwrecks to keep one entertained.Professor Aronmax narrates the story from his perspective as a ten month captive aboard the Nautilus along with his faithful servant Conseil and Canadian harpooner friend Ned Land whose on-going escape plans are continually thwarted within the secretive world of the reclusive Captain Nemo.This is my very first Jules Vern novel, but won't be my last.
