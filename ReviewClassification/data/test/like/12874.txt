This is a diaspora novel; the story of a Bengali family moving to America; the intermingling of cultures, the way different generations adapt and change. It is really well written and is very easy to read and I enjoyed this more than the collection of short stories by the same author. The plot itself is fairly thin and revolves around the main protagonist Gogol Ganguli, his parents (who move to America from India and his various doomed love interests. There are some good food descriptions, and for me that always improves a novel!Lahiri describes cultural alienation rather well; the struggles with dress codes, the tensions between traditional moral values and more modern mores, feeling apart from society, mixing with others in the same situation. Lahiri sometimes switches narrators; this can be illuminating, but she doesn't really do it enough and some alternative points of view would have strengthened the whole. Gogol/nikhil sometimes felt a little flat and more input from the female characters would have made him more three dimensional. It's also about growing up and leaving home; becoming an adult with your parents.There was an emotional warmth and tenderness to this novel which I enjoyed; Lahiri's characters were all likeable in their own way. A simple fable of life, love, growing up and food. Not bad at all.
