5 Vee-licious Stars!! My favorite of the series so far!!Butch's book,Lover Revealed, was such a disappointment, I was hesitant to continue the series, but I loved V so much, I needed to find out if he got a heroine worthy of him! Well the other half of the bromance got his due and J.R Ward hit itOUT OF THE PARKinLover Unbound!!Jane and V...a match made in Brotherhood heaven!! No back and forth with Jane, she lays it all out there, stands her ground, but once she was in, she was in...and behind her man 100%. I loved that about her! V...well I could go on and on, I just adore him! For all that he went through in his life, he finally got the happiness he was so deserving of.Not only did this book offer up a great pairing with Jane and V, we got more John...John, John, John. This guy breaks my heart, but good things are on the horizon for him, I can feel it. John, Blay and Qhuinn...a brotherhood within the Brotherhood...love it! I also enjoyed the part Phury played in this book and how it will transition into his own story.It feel like the author hit her stride with this book. The product endorsements were still there, but not nearly as much as with the first 4 books in the series, it gets annoying after a while. She seemed to focus more on the main characters and didn't go on endlessly about the villains, the writing was much better! Hopefully this will continue throughout the series. I'm looking forward to Phury's book, but the one I can't wait to get to is John's!! Please make it good for me J.R. Ward!
