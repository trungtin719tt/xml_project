This is not a review. There are already thousands of those. Instead, I present an anecdote.I read this in 2008 for my now-defunct neighborhood book club. I decided that my oldest son, who was then 14, should read it for "Mom's Summer Reading Plan" - also known as the Mom-Forces-Us-To-Read-For-Half-An-Hour-Each-Day-Torture-Program by certain members of the family. I felt it was important for him to learn that not every child gets to grow up in a household that has eight different video game systems. I wanted him to imagine what it would be like if his father came home one night and said "We have to move right now. You can take ONE THING with you."Well, he grumbled and he whined. Then he shut up and started to read. He never said too much about the book, though he liked the part where the rat would come to eat out of the mother's big bowl of sugar. And then I saw on his Facebook profile that he had listedThe Glass Castleas his favorite book. Huh, how 'bout that?And now, seven years later, my youngest son came home with the book he has to read for English class. Guess what it is?You got it!Ah . . . sweet vindication. Yup, yup, yup!
