The beginning was amazing! From the beginning it grabbed my attention. Although, towards the middle of the book its appeal left, and the plot became knotty. However, the plot was like a roller coaster ride. One moment you think you know what will happen next, then something thrilling happens. This made me melt and keep reading.Alyson Noel wrote this book very entertaining, interesting, and engaging. When you read this book you can tell that she knows what she's doing. She has the plot all figured out. And, even added surprises that make you demand more.I would have to have seen more of Damen, because he is one of the protagonist. This did leave me with many questions, but I'm pretty sure that lots of these questions will be answered in the next book.Definitely, this book was more exciting than the first book. Hopefully, the next book will be as impressive as this one.Reposeted from by book blog:http://thebookshopaholic.blogspot.com/
