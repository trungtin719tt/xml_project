You know you have it bad for a series when you think: "If I start reading now, I'll finish this book by midnight, start the next one and if I put it down by 3am then I am still able to get six hours of uninterrupted sleep which means I can finish it tomorrow before work and suffer through the brutal book hangover over the weekend."Not even sorry.
