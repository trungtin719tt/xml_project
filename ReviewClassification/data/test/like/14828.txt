The Story of Edgar Sawtelle received a lot of advanced hype. The writer was mentored by Richard Russo and Stephen King wrote the mother of all blurbs for the book. While I didn't love it as much as he did, I did like the book very much. I wouldn't call it a classic piece of American literature, but it's probably one of the best books of the year. The story is a retelling of Hamlet, but focuses on an american boy who is mute. He works at his family's farm where they train the finest dogs in the country. The strength of the writing really comes via the prose. It is unpretenious, simple and direct, but that's what makes it so good. It's honest writing and I never got a sense that the writer was trying to create literature, rather he simply wanted to tell a tale. That's the best kind of writing in my humble opinion. The book is a little long and could probably have been better had it lost around 100 pages. There's a section in the late first half that feels overly repetitive despite the beauty of the langugage. The other "problem" I had with the book was that I didn't really feel the author needed the Hamlet template. The story is good enough on its own. That being said, I spent a lot longer reading this novel than I do most and I enjoyed the week+ spent there. Edgar, Almondine and the other dogs all grew on me and I think over time, this book won't diminish as quickly as others. It's not a perfect book by any means, but it's a perfectly good story told with heart. I recommend it for those who enjoy good, literate Americana stories.
