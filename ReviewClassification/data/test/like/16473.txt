This is the first in the series, I didn't read it for a long time, and then I picked it up. It was so good, I just had to keep reading it. If you don't like cats fighting, or blood described, it doesn't necessarily mean you don't have to read it, there are plenty of othergoodparts in the book, especially where Graypaw, Ravenpaw and Rusty (known as Firepaw in the book) make friends of each other. A brutal part is where Oakheart dies, but the story gets all mixed up, and eventually, drives Ravenpaw out of the ThunerClan camp!Read on to find out more of this adventurous and mystery like book!
