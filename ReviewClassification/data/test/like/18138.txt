This was the first Crichton novel I read, which is probably to his advantage. I knew it was fiction, so I was able to pick it up and cruise right through it. Had I started onThe Andromeda Strain, orAirframe, I might have thought he was a non-fiction writer and not given him a proper chance. As it turns out, I was instantly hooked, and began to furiously and ferociously collect everything I could get my hands on by Michael Crichton. Now I've read most of his novels, and have met him in person. (see photos) Big fan, doodz.Anyway, this is a time-travel story, which automatically bumps it up a point in the storyline rating for me. But it's not your average time-travel tale. It's very detail-oriented, and you learn quickly that some of the characters have an agenda deeper than just wanting to go back and visit the medieval times. The characters are rock solid and believable, and the story is a great rendition of a many-times-told favorite. Who doesn't want to go back in time to the 1500s and check out some castles? Some knights doing battle? I know I do.I know this was made into a movie a couple of years ago, but I haven't seen it. I've heard it didn't do anywhere close to as well as the book did, and did it no justice either. I'll probably rent it someday just because I'm sentimental and I like seeing my favorite characters come to life. I'd recommend this for all you time-travel junkies out there. It has some elements that are surprisingly powerful for being so overtly subtle. It's a very attractive read, and well worth your time.
