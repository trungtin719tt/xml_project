This blew me away. And has done the same thing every time I read it over the many years - I think I was about 14 when I read it. It is done from the Israeli side and we know that it is a biased account and it is FICTION and was written in 1959. What it does say, though, is how good it was to have a country when Jews have been disenfranchised and defenseless for centuries and across all the walks of life.Yes, now we see that there were a whole mass of people who were also disenfranchised - the Lebanese Arabs - but how can it be changed again? For me, he was an American Jew and he wrote in 1958/1959, 10 or 11 years after the State of Israel. Most of the book is about the Holocaust.I find this in the reviewers - 'there is nothing between Hitler and Zionist jews'. Hummmmm....just a small matter of the Holocaust. Whatever it is, this book sure stirs up some feelings. Yes, it is dated - so why are we throwing other modern notions onto it? Surely it may serve a purpose and for me it was positive, all the way through life. I has a professor of Sociology and he shared his own German Jewish background back to the 10th century and what happened to them. I cried. And I cried at this book, every time. Whatever happened to the Jews, they needed a break, they got on in 1948 and it ain't going away.
