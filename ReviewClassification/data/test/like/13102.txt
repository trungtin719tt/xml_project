Wow! If you are a teen girl looking for some love stories between friends and their SUPER-HOT boyfriends, well look no further then the Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants series! This book is about the 4 best friends Bridget, Carmen, Tibby, and Lena when they split up for the summer. With the Pants binding them together wherever they go, their summers are no longer lonely. The Pants witness all break - ups and get togethers and are often shipped with hysterical letters that will make you laugh out loud! I think my favorite is the love - hate relationship between Eric and Bridget, but I can't tell you, so read to find out!
