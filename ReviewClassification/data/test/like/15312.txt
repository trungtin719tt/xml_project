This was another enjoyable instalment in this series, and there were several things that surprised me.Sookie of course ended up in mortal danger at points in this book, and she was lucky to end up alive really. There were some problems between the wolf packs, and problems between the vampires, as well as the arrival of an unexpected relative to deal with, and Sookie really did find herself in some shockingly bad situations! That being said, there were some things that surprised me, and a couple of interesting moments, as well as a little bit of a cliff-hanger at the end(view spoiler)[ how many more telepaths is Sookie going to come across?(hide spoiler)]7 out of 10
