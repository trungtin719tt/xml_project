Even though I am a big fan Welsh's work, this book worked a lot better than I had expected.It is, of course the prequel toTrainspotting, and fills in the backgrounds of our favourite characters during the 1980s, including their introduction to heroin.Like Trainspotting, and many of Welsh's other books it is written in part in Scottish dialect.It amazes me, with the writing, how talented Welsh is to be able to have a different written form for each character. For each chapter before the narrator is fully revealed, it is almost always obvious who the character is just by the formation of their sentences and word choices.At some 550 pages, this book say in my shelf for a long time for two reasons - it is a lengthy investment in time, but more importantly, I was concerned it wouldn't be excellent. It could have been a shallow, or poorly constructed reverse-engineering of Renton, Sick Boy, Spud and Begbie. It could have done a disservice to Trainspotting, one of my favourite books of my youth. Thankfully, it was none of these things.Excellent, and 5 Stars.
