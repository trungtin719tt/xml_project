Some novels are worth the effort and patience. At first, the dense blocks of text inAbsalom, Absalom!felt overwhelming. Faulkner's paragraphs and sometimes his sentences stretch to over a page or two. I tried listening to it, but had to keep rewinding. And the italics in the novel are helpful signals. For me, the best way to experience this novel was to read the text while listening to Grover Gardner's excellent narration. This novel became a deep and immersive experience. It was more difficult for me to settle into its rhythm than Faulkner's other novels, but once I did, I was a captive reader. When read aloud, the sentences, which often halt and start over in a different direction, make perfect sense. People do talk this way.The novel is about Thomas Sutpen and his climb to wealth and power. Over the course of the novel, the extreme extent of his immoral grand "design" is revealed. Faulkner is an amazing storyteller and I was riveted. Like Shreve and Quentin, two of the narrators, I often found myselfinthe story. I was at Sutpen's plantation house, new and glimmering, then later decaying and shrunken. I was in Miss Rosa's darkened study swirling with dust motes and smelling of wisteria.The story is told many times, distilled through various characters and their misperceptions. Clues are dropped, facts left out, I thought one thing was happening and then discovered it was something else the next time it was told. The experience of reading is layered and ever shifting. So yes, difficult --- but worth every bit of sweat and effort. A masterpiece!
