Rosamunde Pilcher weaves yet another heart-stirring tale of life, love, and loss.Sixty-four year old Penelope Keeling reflects on her past after suffering a heart attack. I laughed with her, and cried too. Pilcher's extraordinary ability to bring her characters to life amazes me. I became very engrossed in Penelope's story as her memories and secrets were brought to light. A walk down memory lane revealed long forgotten bliss and sorrow so real my heart ached. Penelope is a character so beautifully written and fully fleshed out that she could actually be my best friend.I hope you don't have to be a woman with grown children to appreciate this novel. The family dynamics that Pilcher created here are realistic and so very human. Choices made throughout a lifetime of ups and downs are examined and Penelope finds that she still has a few difficult decisions to make. And, it's passages like this one that really tugged at my heart:"A ring was the accepted sign of infinity, eternity. If her own life was that carefully described pencil line, she knew all at once that the two ends were drawing close together. I have come full circle, she told herself, and wondered what had happened to all the years. It was a question which, from time to time, caused her some anxiety and left her fretting with a dreadful sense of waste. But now, it seemed, the question had become irrelevant, and so the answer, whatever it was, was no longer of any importance."This passage really made me pause for thought. For many of us, our lives might seem complete if we could get to the point where we believe our life has come full circle. I know that would be enough for me. Sigh.Penelope is unforgettable, and her story is not to be missed. Highly recommend!
