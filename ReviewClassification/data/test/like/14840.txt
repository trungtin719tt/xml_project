You know how George R.R. Martin changes narrative voices between chapters? Well, this book does that, but within paragraphs. In the first hundred pages, there were a few paragraphs that had, internally, four different perspectives. And I thought, what have I gotten myself into? Is this pretentious? Is it precious?And more to the point, can I put up with this for 700 pages?Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
