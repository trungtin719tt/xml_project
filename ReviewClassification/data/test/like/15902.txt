I celebrated theFreedom to Readfor the 2013 ALA Banned Book Week by reading this selection. Yes, it is a short children's picture book, but I was knee deep in other reads this year.So why was this book banned you ask?This book was originally published in 1936. Some saw the material as fascist, socialistic, pacifist or communistic. Munro Leaf, an American writer, had chosen to set this book in Spain. Well, history will tell us in 1936 the Spanish Civil War began a few months after publication. Hitler's Third Reich was already in power in Germany.The leader of the Spanish Nationalist, General Francisco Franco and his supporters saw the book as being pacifist, so it was banned.Hitler called it degenerate propaganda and had it burned, he also supported Franco's Nationalist movement.What exactly is this book about?Being that is a short read I won't give away too much, but Ferdinand is young bull. He doesn't wish to partake in the rough horseplay that his brothers do all day. He would rather sit under a cork tree and enjoy life.Be sure to enjoy the illustrations in the book, as they are fairly accurate for the area. Munro Leaf actually wrote this book for his friend Robert Lawson to illustrate. Lawson was in need of somewhere to showcase his work.See slightly reworded review on myblog.
