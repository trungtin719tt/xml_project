For the first half of this Dave Eggers book--which everyone has been telling me to read since the dawn of time-- I was absolutely in love with Eggers' writing. Eggers' unique voice coupled with his heartbreaking, raw, and personal familial tragedy made for a story that was both poignant and interesting to read. I really enjoyed his asides, and found myself smiling when a conversation between Eggers and his younger brother evolved into a metatextual examination of Eggers' entire venture.But then I got to the long form interview and the wheels sort of fell off the back-half of the story.What worked as cute, funny, or poignant in the first half turns into some sort of artistic ouroboros in which Eggers rarely grounds the story enough for the more experimental tricks he's trying to pull off. Naturally, Eggers prefaces this shift during the aforementioned interview. There's some parts of the second half of the book that I really enjoyed, but it definitely lacks the quality of the opening half.It's a shame because I was so impressed with the first half and so lukewarm by the book's end. No doubt that the book is readable despite its experimental trappings: I read through it in sessions that were long, but I seldom felt as if I were putting in work. I'm glad that I finally got around to this one, thanks to everyone for pushing me to read it!
