When I first started this book - it read like a second book in a series, but I checked online and it said "Book 1" but as I kept reading I knew I was missing something so I looked a bit deeper - there is a short story titled "Alpha and Omegas" that is really the first story of this series. It's in the book "On the Prowl" by a number of authors. After I read the short story, I returned to the book.I liked seeing more of the world Patricia Briggs created with her Mercy Thompson series - she focuses on Charles - the youngest son of the Marrok, who is alpha of all the werewolves in the US. I would have liked to seen a longer more satisfying wrap up at the end(view spoiler)[I would have liked to have read more about the wedding and their relationship - also I was a bit concerned about reading more of Briggs other books because this is the second series character - Anna - who had been raped - Mercy was raped as well.(hide spoiler)]
