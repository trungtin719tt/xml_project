My feelings about this book are mixed. On one hand, it was good but on the other, I was hoping for something better.John Michael has never been a favorite of mine. I think he is a nice person but he just wasn't mature enough to be a BDB hero for me. He just doesn't hold a candle to Rhage, Wrath or V, he comes off more like a teenager or college student. The older brothers are always having to look after him and Quinn always has to fight with him, which made him seem even younger to me. I think he did mature during the book but I still didn't see him as a great hero. He was just too Beta and laid back, he didn't try hard enough to get what he wanted sometimes. I appreciate how sweet and understanding he was with Xhex, their scenes together as she healed were wonderful.I like Xhex. She is tough and strong and a warrior. She went through a horrible ordeal and has had a tough life but she never let it break her. I also like how she allowed John Michael into her life, despite her issues and hangups, she realized what a treasure she had in him. One thing did bother me, the way she always hated anything she deemed girly like crying. Being a woman does not mean being weak. Crying is not being weak. I think Ward was trying to portray her as a tough girl but she came off as trying to be too much of a man in those scenes.I liked Xhex and JM together but I was a bit disappointed in the actual romance. It wasn't quite enough for me, I didn't feel enough of a connection and passion until later in the book. The first love scene squicked me out a bit because Xhex had just been through such a horrible time that I had trouble thinking she would enjoy it. The later love scenes were hotter and more enjoyable for me. I really enjoyed the later parts where they are together, though things moved really fast for them to get mated. I did feel like Xhex was kind of dominant in the relationship because she was so much more experienced, both in life and sexually. I think they will get more of a balance as they live together and JM gets more experience under his belt. I was bothered a bit about the endless mentions of Murhder, I didn't like being reminded of how close he and Xhex were because I wanted to see her with JM alone. But overall, I was happy with the ending and enjoyed the final scenes.I could have done without ALL of the Lash parts. What a waste of space that could have been spent showing me where in the world Mary and Bella went to, plus I wanted to see more of my men Rhage and V. Much more of them because I like them much better than JM, Quinn or Blay. Some parts from Lash's sections were violent and unnecessary. Blah.Quinn and Blay - I like Blay, he seemed like a good man. Quinn was a complete ass to Blay for no apparent reason. Blay was courageous to pretty much ask for what he wanted, only to be shut down by Quinn because --- I have no clue why. Quinn created all his own trouble so I don't feel bad for him. Blay deserves better, I hope he is happy with Saxon until Quinn grows some balls and admits what he wants. But no matter what he still hurt Blay a lot, which was selfish.The Georgia mansion parts - another waste of space. I understand she wanted to introduce Murhder again but this was long and drawn out.Another disappointment: there was no explanation about Darius and what the associaton is with John Matthew. Was JM actually Darius reincarnated (didn't seem like it anymore)? Or was he really JM's father and a spirital part of him? Why wasn't this really addressed?I did like the old time Darius parts, I enjoyed seeing Thor when he was young. Darius seemed like a great guy, I wish he would have lived because he deserved a great shellan.I enjoyed seeing Thor recovering a bit and dealing with his grief. The part where he went to the house and he looked in the sky made me cry.One big negative: it seemed like there were even more Wardisms (the crazy wording she comes up with) and the F-bombs were bursting all over the place. When she tries too hard to write "cool" stuff, I for some reason am reminded that she is a 40-ish year-old white woman trying to sound like a young punk. And it's just funny instead of whatever the heck it's supposed to be.So overall, I liked Lover Mine. Ward is a talented author who can really pull you into the story and she has created one hell of a world in the BDB. But I just wasn't a huge fan of the hero and didn't see enough of the guys I really like, so it wasn't quite great to me. I enjoyed Lover Avenged much more because Rhev was such a great hero. There were a lot of parts of Lover Mine that I did really enjoy, so overall this is still a winner for me.
