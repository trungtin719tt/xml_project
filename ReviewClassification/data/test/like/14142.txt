YAAAAAASSSS VICTORIA YAAAAAASSSSSS.It's like an X-Men dystopia stuck in a high fantasy world on crack.Look, guys, don't worry about the love triangle. Actually, calling it a love triangle is very spoilerish and I wish I could further calm your feels, but alas, you must read it for yourself.Immensely loved this with very minor reservations and I can't wait for book 2! Full review to come!
