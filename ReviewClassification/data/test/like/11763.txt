I wanted to read this book so badly - I was in 7th grade, my sister wanted to take drivers education. She did not want to ride her bike alone, so she bribed me. Allowing me to read on the church steps while I waited for her lesson to be over. BUT I GOT TO READ THE BOOK! I really liked it. The descriptions were so vivid, the story so gripping. I do not know where my sister got the book, I seriously doubt she had read it. OMG Epiphany! It was my dad's book! He gave it to her to bribe me with so she did not go alone &amp; I was basically occupied for the hours.... hmmmmm that is a really good theory.... :O
