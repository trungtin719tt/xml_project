...he hated how fucked up and obscene the world and everything in it had become.Well... fuck.I decided to wait for at least one day before writing this review because I needed time to process this book. But even though more than 24 hours passed, I still haven't processed it even a bit.Not in a long time did I read a book that grabbed me asShutter Islanddid. When I was reading this book, and I had to put it down to do some other stuff, it followed me everywhere. When I wasn't reading it, I surely was thinking about it.Shutter Islandcrawled under my skin, and it will stay there for a long time. Even now, when I finished it, I'm sure that it will be somewhere in the back of my mind for a long time.I'm not going to say anything about the plot, because I think that this book should be read without knowing anything about it. If you are planning to read this book, just read it without researching what it is about, and have it in mind that even if you guess the twist, don't let that take away the enjoyment of reading it. I guessed one part of the twist somewhere in the middle, but what blew my mind was what that twist did to the characters in the story. Not everything is about the twist.This was my Lehane's second book (I readMystic Rivera while back), and it's definitely my favorite book by him so far. Truly an amazing book, that will stay with me for a long,longtime.
