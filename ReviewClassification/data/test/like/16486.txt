Lucky me. I got this as a proof because of my blog. I can't believe this writer. She can handle any genre. This one is right up to date and covers one of my favorite things... a person against the elements. And this person is a wimp (you'd think, and so does she), a bullied wife, an unappreciated mother, a Valium addict, a telly watcher, nobody really. So she decides, what the hell, why keep on living? What for? So she walks out of one of those mega grocery stores and into the desert around Tucson, Arizona, to end it all. How could she miss? Illegal aliens die there all the time. But not Mrs Warner. Mrs. Warner discovers (once she stops whining) that she's more than equal to a desert. She becomes Molly Brock again, the girl she would have been if she hadn't made chickenshit choices. Now, this would make some terrific movie for an aging Hollywood leading lady. Susan Sarandon, you listening?
