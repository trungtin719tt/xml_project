Dark Placesis a masterpiece, composed of troubled characters,disturbing deeds and buried secrets.For me, it wasn't as good asGone GirlorSharp Objectsbut it still managed to be a fantastic mystery, full of suspense and tragedy.Gillian Flynn takes a similar route with her characters as Libby Day is a deeply troubled individual, seeking the truth behind her family's murder.She uncovers numerous shocking truths which shape this novel into a true page-turner.Libby Day is an incredibly complex character who I found immediately interesting.Her history hooks you straight away and leaves you with a serious sense of unease.Her brother, Ben Day is another compelling character and he shares a narrative in this story with Libby and their mother, Patty.The story is told by consecutively switching between these three from the past and present.This adds a unique,gripping touch which makes you eager to read on to find out what happens.I couldn't pick a favourite narrative as I enjoyed them all equally as the insight into different perspectives is a thrilling aspect of the story.The plot is brilliantly constructed with so many lingering questions that make you invest more thought into the story and keeps you guessing.The mystery behind the murders and Ben just keeps unraveling, transpiring into something much more unpredictable.I loved the unpredictability Gillian Flynn manages to weave into her stories and she successfully does it here again.The book is so great as it thrives in so many areas which all come together to sculpt this gem.I did prefer the stories and mysteries in her other books butDark Placesis not a disappointment.I may have preferred her other books but I still love this one as it has so many strengths that flourish throughout the book.
