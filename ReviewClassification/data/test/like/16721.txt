4.5 Stars.I am going to completely agree with all my friends who said 'this book is based on everyone except the main characters'.Phury and Cormia didn't even have half of their book- which is quite ridiculous. I didn't even bother reading Lash's, Mr.D's and Omega's POV, i literally skipped their parts. I was very bored at times with John's side of the story too, so i sometimes skipped a bit there as well.I'm not going into any more critizm than that because i found none, and also what is the point? - The author already knows where she went wrong withLover Enshrined(as she stated in an interview on YouTube).I was extremely happy to be getting more of Z and Bella though; i love those two.Surprisingly i was not even once annoyed with Cormia, and found myself wondering why everyone was and didn't like her. I thought she was a great character, and i understood her. She is one of the Chosen, so i don't know what people's problem with her was. The Chosen are supposed to behave like Cormia did in the book (only Cormia on the other hand was actually rebellious - so you should like her already).Phury. He was the one who was rather getting on my nerves. I swear, that lad has some serious issues, and he thinks his twin is more fucked up than him...But i did love the ending. I wasn't sure how all the Primale shit was going to be solved, but the author actually managed it well.I was very happy with the end that's for sure, and my heart was melting on the spot(view spoiler)[ when Z came over and he told Phury about Nalla being safely born, and then he invited him over and they had this brother-ly hug. That was so heart-warming!(hide spoiler)]Overall,Lover Enshrinedwas another amazing BDB book that i loved. I was engrossed in the story and kept on wondering what would happen next. I'll be reading Z and Bella's novella soon, and then onto Rhev's story - YAY!
