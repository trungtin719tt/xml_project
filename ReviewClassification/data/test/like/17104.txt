Who would have thought that a story with so much description of fly fishing could have universal appeal? Lesser writers would have required hundreds of pages and still not been able to capture the tender strength, the beauty and ultimate weakness in quiet, ordinary brotherly love. The title story was so perfect that it left me in a place beyond words. Maclean never got in the way of his story. He simply invited the reader along with the narrator, his brother and brother-in-law one summer and allowed the reader to observe without needing to explain it away. The other stories in this collection are coming of age moments. Although they are good, they pale in comparison to the title story. 4.5 stars
