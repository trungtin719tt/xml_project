Just a joy to read (preferably out loud!) with the individual stanzas being self-contained vignettes/episodes as well as moving the plot along, and all beautifully evocative of time/place/society/character/landscape/seasons etc etc. I have now read this in two different English translations (Spadling and Elton) and have a third (CH Johnston) lined up, but fear I'm going to need to learn Russian in order fully to appreciate! :o(
