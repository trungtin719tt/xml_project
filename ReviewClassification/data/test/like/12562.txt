The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling, this one produced by Race Point Publishing in 2016. Illustrations by Maurice &amp; Edward Detmold. The collection of his stories were originally published in magazines in the late 1800s.I highly recommend this book for children and adults.I reread it for Kipling's writing style, but still enjoyed his story telling.
