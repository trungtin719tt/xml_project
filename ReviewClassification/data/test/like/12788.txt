re-read in 2018Still incredible. Of course. I actually listened to the audiobook this time around (while flipping through the book to experience the gorgeous illustrations again) and it was FANTASTIC. Jason Isaacs read the book, and of course it was a pleasure to have him tell this story. I recommend this to every single person ever.first read in 2012This book was so beautiful.
