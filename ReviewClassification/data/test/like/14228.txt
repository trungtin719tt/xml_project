I have some few favorites, but if I'm allowed to use phrases like,'this one spoke to me'or something like that, I can only name,Catcher in the rye, Fight Club, and this one. I've been trying to write a review past one week, but it just gets longer and absurd-er. I'll save it for another day. But, you see, this one fucking spoke to me.
