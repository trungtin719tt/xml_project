Such a fun, entertaining read!Initial thoughts:1. Interactive with the reader. Riordon pulls you into the story!2. Amazing Egyptian mythology! Gods, and magic everything!3. Elements that remind me of Percy Jackson and Harry Potter. Didn't bother me, but it's noteworthy.4. Full of banter, and sarcasm. Loved it!5. Action-packed, and fast paced! Lot's of story but it's filled with something insane.Check out my full book video review!
