This is an unsettling book, although I would not say (as one critic did) that it is harrowing. It lacks the immediacy that this would need, as it is exclusively told in flashback, and furthermore the structure is epistolary - in fact it could almost qualify as a series of soliloquies.The main character (Eva) is trying to search through her memories to establish whether she could be responsible in any way for her 15 year old son's killing of several of his schoolmates and two adults. This is not a promising premise for a interesting lengthy novel, but I did find it absorbing. Although Eva has been found unlikeable by some, I found her to be a many-layered believable character. However there are a few minor quibbles.Eva, I worked out, was born in 1945. Part of the time therefore when she would have been considering having a child would have been in the late 1960s, when Paul Ehrlich'sThe Population Bombwas hugely influential. With the plethora of reasons for and against having a child that Eva muses on, it is hard to credit that she would have completely missed out on agonising about the problem of over-population. In fact her eventual reason for having her son seems to have been an impromptu masochistic one, which I found barely credible.(view spoiler)[ Similarly, when she chose to have a second child, I cannot believe she would have ignored the warning bells about Kevin, especially when she would not even have a pet dog for fear of what he might do to it.(hide spoiler)]The structure of the novel too is rather contrived. It has been said that"nobody writes in this way to someone they've lived with for 30 years", and that it is"self-consciously literary". Whereas I rather enjoyed the sardonic wit of the narrator, it did begin to dawn on me that(view spoiler)[there was a reason why these letters were not answered. They were clearly partly cathartic and partly an attempted analysis of where (if anywhere) to apportion blame. Eva was an intelligent and educated woman, familiar with the Nature v. Nurture controversy and many psychological disorders, especially of children. But it was also a cry for help, so why was it unanswered?Personally I guessed the reason for this about a third of the way through the book, and expect others would too, though I doubt whether this was intentional on the part of the author. It had already been mentioned that teenage killers such as Kevin tended to kill close family members or themselves too. But when the "shock" came very near the end of the book I realised just how deliberately this fact had been hidden. For the patricide not to have been mentioned in Eva's retelling of her many encounters and musings was just unrealistic. Ultimately this was irritating; the reader feels manipulated. From reading what apparently is a serious and believable portrayal of a nightmarish situation, this obscuring of a hugely important fact just seems like a cheap trick.I also find it hard to credit that the couple did not even seem to consider alternative methods of child-care. Eva loved her work; her husband adored Kevin, never believing in his malevolence. They were both in their own private hell when Eva stayed at home with the child. Wouldn't any sane person living in the society they did, at the time they did, at least have considered swapping roles? And would Eva really have slotted quite so happily into the nurturing/cooking/cleaning/50's housewife model?(hide spoiler)]But it is always possible to nit-pick. Ultimately this is a novel, and not a case-study. As such it is a very good read, and deserving of its Orange prizewinner status.
