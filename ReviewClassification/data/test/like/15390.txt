The Bible, Hmm, how do you review God's Word? people have attacked it, scientists have expended their best energies trying to disprove it, governments have butchered millions to kill it, bu it remains 'For if their purpose or activity is of human origin, it will fail, but if it is from God, you will not be able to stop these men; you will only find yourselves fighting against God.'
