You guys have completely lost the plot.You simply can't say that this is not a good book. It's well written, the story stands its ground and there is that bit of intrinsec poetry which can make a good read into an excellent one.And remember, it is a book! What is this bigotry of saying that you don't like it because she has an extra marital affair?The story works and the main doubt the author underlines is for her between leaving her obligations and following her heart, regardless of the adultery sitution, or staying home with her family. Nothing else.It is a story of true love, that can happen even after one gets married (oh what a wonder!) and that can lead someone's life into turmoil for maybe the only time ever.The movie was brilliant and the book is no less.I am simply astonished at some comments. But this makes just my belief of modern times stronger and stronger: people and literature are drifting apart. Go buy some comics instead, if you have to judge a book on such meaningless details.
