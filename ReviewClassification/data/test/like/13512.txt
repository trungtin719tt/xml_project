The last part of the Oedipus plays by Sophocles, Antigone, centers around the events which have occurred after the death of Oedipus in Colonus. Back in Thebes, Eteocles and Polyneices, the sons of Oedipus, have killed each other through their battle over the thrown. Eteocles, the chosen king, had fought with his usurping brother Polyneices and their uncle, Creon, decides to honor the body of the former while denying the latter an honorable burial. Polyneices's body is left to rot outside the walls of the city where birds can pick at the flesh of the corpse. In Ancient Greek beliefs, not having a proper burial meant that Polyneices's spirit would be left to wander the earth and not able to descend into Hades.Antigone, sister of the two brothers, decides that she needs to bury her brother's body. Though Creon has decried that anyone who buries Polyneices will be killed, she cannot allow her brother to be so disrespected in death. Antigone discusses the event with her sister, Ismene, who advises against such a course. Antigone is engaged to her cousin Haemon, the son of Creon, and has much to live for. Ismene cautions her against throwing away her life after that of the dead brother, but Antigone remains resolute.Creon comes in with his chorus of soldiers, justifying his decision against the burial of Polyneices. Novels comes to him that someone has buried the man and gone against Creon's decree. They uproot Polyneices and then Antigone is found attempting to rebury him. Creon is left no choice butto condemn Antigone to death for disobeying his decree. Antigone justifies her actions by telling Creon that she is obeying the law of her family and the law of the Gods and would do it again.As Antigone is taken off, Creon sends her to be walled up in a cave to die alone. His son, Haemon, enters and tells Creon that he will kill himself if Creon does not free his betrothed. Nevertheless, Creon refuses to change his decision. Tiresius then enters and tells Creon that if he does not free Antigone, dreadful events will take place and he will be punished by the Gods. Creon rushes off to free Antigone, but he finds that she has already hung herself in the cave. Haemon, in despair, commits suicide and Creon's wife when she hears the news also kills herself. Bereft of all his family, Creon is left in despair alone and fatherless because of his unnatural actions.
