Shocking no one, this book was and is a vital part of who I am as a person.The breadth of human emotion the riveting story pulls the reader through; the stunning and energetic imagery; the profound sense of forward motion and evolution; this is a book that truly transcends what books can be.It was also my favorite book as a child that my dad would read out loud to me, so I may be slightly biased with my interpretation of this (otherwise inarguable) masterpiece.
