The thing with existentialism is that once you admit there's no meaning, you have to admit that there'sno meaning,and people get freaked out about it. I don't know why. I was raised atheist and I've never thought there was any meaning and it seems okay to me; maybe it's only scary if youusedto think there was a meaning and suddenly youfind outthere isn't one. Listen, I'll tell you the meaning of life.1) Be nice2) have funThat's it.Neither of those things occur to Antoine Roquentin in this book, so instead he spends 100% of his time freaking right the fuck out. (Sartre felt that we have to create our own meaning, which both is and isn't what I've done here, and his protagonist doesn't get around to it.) The Nausea is what he gets when he thinks about how nothing means anything, which happens often. There are norules,he thinks. There is noorganization."Every existing thing is born without reason, prolongs itself out of weakness and dies by chance," he says and by the way here's a super fun game for you single people: pick a quote from this book for your next Bumble date and see if you can say it and still get laid. Here are some more for you.- "I marvel at these young people: drinking their coffee, they tell clear, plausible stories."- "Things are bad! Things are very bad: I have it, the filth, the Nausea."- "'If you look at yourself too long in the mirror, you'll see a monkey.' I must have looked at myself even longer than that; what I see is well below the monkey, on the fringe of the vegetable world, at the level of jellyfish."- "For a moment I wondered if I were not going to love humanity. But, after all, it was their Sunday, not mine."- "We were a heap of living creatures, irritated, embarrassed at ourselves, we hadn't the slightest reason to be there, none of us, each one, confused, vaguely alarmed, felt in the way in relation to the others."- "What if something were to happen? What if something suddenly started throbbing?"That last one might work.Here's another thing Roquentin says: "I suppose it is out of laziness that the world is the same day after day. Today it seemed to want to change. And then,anything, anythingcould happen." But the thing with this book is that anythingdoesn'thappen, and while I understand that it's sortof the point that nothing happens, that doesn't change the fact thatnothing fucking happens,and we have a word for that: the word is boring.I mean - if this is your first existential freakout, you might get more out of it. I feel like maybe this should be read during college, when people get pretty fired up for existential freakouts. If you're already a grown-up, it's frankly too late for this kind of malarkey. Listen: life is meaningless. You don't need to be here. It's fine. Be nice. Have fun.
