VIEW MY REVIEW:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQj1x...March 2018What can I say. This is my favorite book of all time. Nothing brings me more strength than chapter thirty-nine. Nothing brings me more peace than chapter fifty-eight. I will never get over howevery single chapterfeels like a roller coaster. I will never not have to put this book down to catch my breath, to cry, to bring myself back to the real world. I've written enough essays about how much this series means to me so i'll stop being emo, but Juliette's growth and her resilience in this book is awe-inspiring. And so incredibly relevant and inspiring to my own mental health. When I annotated this book last September, I attacked the pages with blue highlighter to mark my favorite quotes from Juliette about staying strong, and there's one that makes me cry every time I read the book:I've been here before, I tell myself. I've been lonelier than this, more hopeless than this, more desperate than this. I've been here before and I survived. I can get through this.Last semester when I had a relapse of my anxiety that was so debilitating I nearly dropped out of school, I would tell this quote to myself. Rereading it after recovering from that point in my life just slammed into me because I'm so grateful for it. I'm going to cry again right now as I'm typing this just remembering how much this book touches the deepest corners of my heart and speaks so true to my own fears and the way my anxiety influences my life. I know Juliette's not real, but if she were, I would want to hug her and never let go. I want to hug this book and never let go.I truly want to sob every time I remember this isn't the last book in the series anymore. There's 2 days left until Restore Me comes out and I'm so terrified but so, so thrilled. This series has healed me enough to last for a lifetime; I can't wait to see where we go from here.September 2017YES I already read this book once this year buT THEN RESTORE ME WAS ANNOUNCED AND DYLAN SENT ME A COPY TO ANNOTATE SO LET ME LIVE!!!!So 50% of me reading this book was me being like "omg restore me prediction omg easter egg i didn't notice before omg new theory omg restore me foreshadowing," and the other 50% was me roasting warner and how much i still hate the ending of this book. a lot of people accuse me for putting shatter me on a pedestal but i wish i could mail this copy to anyone who says so because half of my annotations in the first half of this book are like "warner can fuck off instead of trying to get her to be in love with him" and "i hate when he does stuff like this." the boy is problematic, but what can i say.I think this reread really just solidified how much I fucking love this book for Juliette's character growth. I had an entire highlighter color to highlight the quotes and scenes in which Juliette was particularly badass, and there were entire sections that I think are really undiscussed in the fandom that Juliette really shines through on her own. She has an entire conversation with Kenji about, "It's not about Adam or Warner, it's about me and finding my own strength," and I think it's one of the most important parts of the series and an absolute turning point. It makes me want to cry every time I reread the scene that she talks about, "I was locked up in an asylum for 264 days because I made myself a prisoner to my own thoughts and suffering, but I never even contemplated that my own strength could have broken me out of there with my bare hands." It's so sad, but so revolutionary for Juliette's character development. The way that she unendingly fights for her friends and her world, as well as how she is ALWAYS nice and considerate to people no matter the circumstance, is always really inspiring to me. She's such a good person even when she doesn't need to be, and her empathy and compassion is really something I envy.I really won't be able to stand her suffering in Restore Me because she is such a precious child of mine that I want to protect.And since this is the fifth time I've reread this and I think you understand the depths of my feelings for it already, I'll go. But EEEEEEEEPPP RESTORE MEApril 2017This is the first time that I've read this and finished it, clutching it to my chest, thinking, "this book is flawless. there are zero issues. every action has a meticulously cultivated intention behind it. every single one of these characters deserves love and happiness. (except for adam, he can choke.)when i reread unravel me i was scared that i was losing my passion for this series because it really didn't make me as emotional as it used to but i legit cried during this reread at least 10 times so i guess i just wasn't feelin unravel me at that moment because i was feelin this every goddamn second.(i also hate rereading these because it makes me realize that half the fanfictions i have written are super out of character and i have so much wrong info that i forgot about. but oh well.)March 20152nd reread (idk why i didn't re-review this after i reread it the first time)what can i even say. it gets better every time i reread it, every time i notice new small details. (did you know delalieu has a mustache??????)i can still point out its flaws and i still am really frustrated with the ending but at this point, i know this book so well that i can see it like it's a freakin movie. it's insane. i love juliette so so so so so so so so so so so so so much, holy shiitake mushrooms. okay. i don't know how to pull myself out of this slump coming on. jeez.January 2014I'm filming a review but it will not be up until a couple days after the release datebut guys, prepare yourselves.anything feelings you had about anything are probably gonna do a 180.August 2013I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW IT I KNEW ITI THOUGHT IT WOULD BE IGNITE ME AND THE EYELASHES WOULD BE FLAMESBUT THIS IS SO MUCH BETTEReven though i hate the color orange BUT THAT'S OKAY OH MY GODS THIS IS MORE THAN FANTASTICBUTwarner. why would she. warner. shes just making it seem like. warner.i don't like this. i do like it but i dont like itja feel?June 2013WE HAVE A DESCRIPTION ADFHJASKHFLASJDHFLSDIAHFKIDUSHAFLIDAHokay but you can totally tell that she and warner are gonna be together a lot, so it becomes clear that all the questions she's answered about there being a lot of intimate scenes proves it'll all be with warner unless adam becomes a third wheel which might suck even more.BUT I NEEEEED THIS BOOK :(April 2013I haven't read Unravel Me yet but i'm already excited about this one.
