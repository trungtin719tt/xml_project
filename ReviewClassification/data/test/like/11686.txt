Disclaimer: I love math and physics and books that make me feel stupid, as in they are that intelligent. It was interesting learning about the development of science as it refers to the way we think about the universe and how scientific discoveries have been influenced and influence the way people think about God. My favorite section was the discussion of black holes and antimatter.At times Hawking lost me. He wants to explain theory to the masses, but as he draws near to his own theory, he got excited and zoomed along, forgetting that us simpletons haven't memorized the ten theories he's building upon that he's given us a brief overview about. When I had to listen to a theory a few times or try to remember exactly what the uncertainty principle or thermodynamic arrow of time is, it was harder to take a mental pause in audio form, but had I been reading a physical book, I would have fallen asleep every few minutes. It's a book to make your brain hurt, maybe less so if you've recently taken an advanced physics class.Nevertheless, it was fascinating and gives you much to mull over, especially about how little man knows about the laws governing the universe when he can only observe effects and describe them. The further theories develop, the more I am left to question the givens they take from other theories.
