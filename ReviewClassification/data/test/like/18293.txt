So I just finished reading this series for the first time and loved it. The edition I have doesn't have a list of which order to read the books in, so I had to guess. In case you're wondering, the order is: A Wrinkle in Time; A Wind in the Door; Many Waters; and A Swiftly Tilting Planet. I'd be hard-pressed to pick a favourite, but I really enjoyed A Swiftly Tilting Planet. I liked how everything was so interconnected. I really enjoyed the series because it's sci-fi, and fantasy, and clever and amusing. I would highly recommend this series.From A Wrinkle in Time: I liked the part where Meg tried to explain light and dark to someone who has never seen. Favourite characters: Aunt Beast and Calvin O'Keefe. But mostly Aunt Beast.
