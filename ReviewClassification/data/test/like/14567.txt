"No Man is an Island, entire of itself; Every man is a Continent; a part of the Main"So said John Donne and I have to say that I quite agree with him. Even the self confessed loner isn't exactly alone and if I have to stray a little further, much to the screams of those who call themselves loners, I will say that they form relationships as well; often long and most cherished relationships. Before the naysayers attack me with their words, I shall confess and say that, relationships aren't merely created with other persons or should I say animate things but are often with the inanimate and the obscure and often the invisible as well. While we may prefer to sequester the word relationships into steady and exact boundaries, we often find it difficult to do so. Our relationships often include those with our books, music, art, science philosophy, thoughts, enigmas, imaginations and the list definitely goes on. And when we bond with such inanimate or obscure objects, we find that we aren't really alone in this world because there are some who share that same relationship or maybe a similar one; and then begins the bond, the relationship and the lack of loneliness even when we are alone. Thoughts and ideas mingle and interact with each other bringing about a conversation so beautiful, so emphatic and yet so enigmatic that even if all the world were to be destroyed, we would still have those in our hearts and minds to keep us alive till kingdom come. So, I believe, John Donne is perfectly right when he says those above words.My interpretation might be wrong of the exact poem but I think this interpretation fits this review perfectly. This epistolary novel, which created a whirlwind of emotions throughout the world after its publication, leading to its immense popularity, which in turn led to it being added to my own humble little reading list, actually began by accident of chance. An obscure letter written by the author living in the US to a small antiquary bookshop in the UK was that chance that began this wonder called 84, Charring Cross Road. A relationship was formed, not only between the author and the various characters of the bookshop but also between the author and the readers and between these readers themselves. A simple letter became the start of so much emotion and so much chaos and tumult, albeit positively, in the lives of many. Isn't it obvious why I still love to write letters or people love to write reviews or authors love to write books? A relationship - that's the basis of all this. A relationship with words that somehow becomes a relationship between individuals, making even a loner part of a family.Helene Hanff, in this beautiful book, shows us how a struggling playwright without much funds could create a wonder and show the world that bonding does not believe in boundaries and neither does it bow down to distances. The heart and mind is capable of so much more than we believe it to be capable of. The limit, I believe, lies in our own minds and thoughts, and not really in the organs by themselves. So, why do we put up these borders, these boundaries, these limitations? Why not just allow it to soar? Fear? Is that it? Fear of rejection, fear of inability to sustain oneself if things were to go wrong, fear of losing more than we gain? Quite possible! This fear provides us with too many limitations, making it impossible for us to go beyond.However, Ms. Hanff, through this very small and simple and in parts funny while in parts monotonous novel, brings to light a ray of hope. Hope that love and relationship knows no distance, fears no loss, accepts no limitations and will soar despite all trials and tribulations. Her correspondence with Frank Doel at the beginning and then the inclusion of other parties to that correspondence, including the family of Frank Doel, shows us that relationships can be forged through mere letters, sight unseen. Confidences can be shared and bonds can be forged between like minded individuals, if we were so determined to do. From humorous belittling of certain books to the joy of getting that perfect one, from the stiff upper lip British reserve to the easy camaraderie of sharing recipes, this book is definitely a delight for those who choose to see the beauty behind the words, the angst and joy expressed in words that are often shocking (when she talks about tearing books apart, which am sure all book lovers will cringe at) and yet so endearing (when she talks about how her own humble abode with its plain bookshelf isn't the best place for a book that has gleaming leather, gold stamping and beautiful type).Through her letters, Ms. Hanff, not only shares her interest in books but also gives us a glimpse of her life, her struggles, her joys, her views, her own attempts at writing. And she does this in a style that is direct and honest whilst also being truly generous and caring. That she begins to care for those people who work in the bookshop is clear from the manner in which she takes time to read and know what hardships they were facing in their country. And this caring was truly reciprocated is also clear by the way the British reserve melts and she forms a place in their hearts forever. In this current dog eat dog world, such old fashioned caring, which often went beyond her means, shows that empathy and love still exists. That people don't really need material benefits to bond with each other, they simply need to care and empathise. I guess, you could say that this was the most important lesson in this book.As I was reading this, I turned nostalgic, and recollected my experiences in these past few years, especially after joining the Goodreads forum. I believe that Helene Hanff would have been totally pleased with this forum and the kinds of bonds that we as patrons create and nourish and of course cherish. The intellectual bond gives way to an emotional bond that is way too strong and important for us to allow petty stuff to get in between. Does this mean that it doesn't have drama? No, not at all. In fact, relationships are forged stronger with some drama, with some pain and often sorrow as well. We see all this in Ms. Hanff's book and I find it same with me and my Goodreads friends as well. Some of my most cherished friendships are with people here and I know that it wouldn't matter if we were to disappear tomorrow for when we meet, we shall pick up from where we left; just as Ms. Hanff did after(view spoiler)[Frank Noel died(hide spoiler)].In a world, where there is so much strife, so much negativity, so much chaos, books like these give us hope that it doesn't have to be like that. I won't be naive and say that all things will change for the better or that strife and negativity and chaos won't exist. However, I do feel that these small anchors allow you that moment of bliss, give you that simple peace, appreciate your loner nature and yet carry you forward in this maze called life by simply saying 'You are not alone'.I would definitely recommend this book to everyone. It is a small book but one packed with a lot of meaning, if you were to get your teeth into it by biting below the surface and exploring it with a respect that it deserves.
