background characters.you don't think about them much.(unless you're a harry potter fan i guess)but they're seething.writhing.riveting.they have their own stories.they have their own explorations, philosophies, existential breaks.all this goes unnoticed.but worse! but more importantly! ----because who cares about the thoughts of a background character, come on come the fuck on come ON ----they have their own perspective on the real storyand it is not what you expect.and you have no idea.no idea.this has been in me for 8 years.a reread:books that scream your name precisely.
