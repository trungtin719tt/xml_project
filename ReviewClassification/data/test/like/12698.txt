Find all of my reviews at:http://52bookminimum.blogspot.com/It's a snow day today and since my tiny humans are to the point where my snow days are numbered since they aren't so tiny any longer I decided to stay home with them in order toread pornmake cookies and hot cocoa and scream loving things out the front door like "IT'S 10 DEGRESS OUTSIDE - GET YOUR ASSES BACK IN HERE BEFORE YOU FREEZE TO DEATH!" But then I realized this book would be expiring from my Kindle in like a minute and a half so I figured I better morph my plan and get a "review" churned out right quick.To be honest, I don't really know what to say.Geek Lovehas been on my TBR since 2012. I'm fairly certain I even checked it out from the library at one point and returned it without reading. WhenRon 2.0was trying to bait all us creeps with hisLast Daysupdates someone mentionedGeek Loveand since I'm an asshole I went with that one rather than Ron's choice.Enough with the backstory, right? You probably want to know about the book. Well, it goes a little something like this . . . . ."Tell about the time when Mama was the geek!"Y'all know what a geek is, right?Well, yeah, but this one isn't about the kind of geek McDreamy was before he got dreamy. It's about this kind . . . .That was Mama Lil. Lil had big dreams of being a trapeze girl, but an unfortunate accident proved that wasn't meant to be. Lil became the geek instead, catching the eye of Papa Al. With the help of some choice dope, a few insecticides and a handful of radioisotopes the two Binewskis created averyunique family . . . .Geek Loveis the story of family, of sibling rivalry, of sacrifice, of religion and a need for fame and glory. It definitely reminds us all to . . .And featured a character that, even though it's the first week of the new year, I will remember forever. Oh little Boychick . . . .I haveneverread anything like it and highly doubt I ever will. I don't know who to recommend this to because it is most assuredly not a story for everyone. But if you have a taste for the unusual and appreciate writing that isn't overdone or purple, but still makes an impact . . . ."Do you know what the monsters and demons and rancid spirits are? Us, that's what. You and me. We are the things that come to the norms in nightmares. The thing that lurks in the bell tower and bites out the throats of the choirboys - that's you, Oly. And the thing in the closet that makes the babies scream in the dark before it sucks their last breath - that's me. And the rustling in the brush and the strange piping cries that chill the spine on a deserted road at twilight - that's the twins singing practice scales while they look for berries."You should give it a go and become one of us . . . .
