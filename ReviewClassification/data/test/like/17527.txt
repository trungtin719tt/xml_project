Lestat has come a long way from whence we first met him. He has known mortal pain and chose his vampiric fate over a chance at salvation. Lestat sought to find the answers to his unanswerable questions; where is God? Am I damned? Now, Lestat will find the answers to these questions.We meet Memnoch, the devil. In this book Lestat will tell us all the secrets of heaven and hell.. Mortals and the undead alike have gotten this story all wrong..and Memnoch is here to set the story straight.Yes, the devil is an outcast, but was the banishment just? What did Memnoch learn when he was cast down to earth to live as mortals do? Lestat is awakened by this knowledge and as a result, so are we.Essentially, through this conversation between Memnoch and Leatat we see the biblical history and creation of mankind and life as we know it. It is interesting to see God written this way, to see biblical history written this way, and when you throw vampires into the mix, it's always a fun time..One of the things that I love about this book, and what sets it apart for me from the rest of the series (so far), is that Memnoch the Devil isn't just a work of fiction. This book has philosophical undertones to it that stick with you. No matter what your beliefs may be, this book will make you sit back and think. The truly genius thing about this is, as you ponder and digest all these events so does Lestat, and in this sense, you truly take the journey with him.I get that this book may not be for everyone. There are a lot of religious views, however different from societies main beliefs, drenched throughout her book. Perchance we are seeing Anne Rice's own struggles with religion here, but I felt that overall the tale was interesting and thought provoking.The end of the book was amazing to me. What happens to Lestat, when he essentially goes crazy, is both endearing, funny and sad at the same time. I literally fell in love with his character. I saw the whole journey of the story and I wished for more...
