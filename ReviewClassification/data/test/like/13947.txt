2018 UPDATE: I just watched the film and it was amazing :)The stereotype of Alzheimer's is usually something like this:Of course, what a lot of people don't realize is how early in life Alzheimer's can appear, and how many people it affects around the world, from famous fiction author Terry Pratchett, to our neighbors, our family members, even in some cases ourselves.Still Alicegives a fictional face to these people everywhere by sharing the same story that so many people are dealing with right now. Alice is a normal woman, in fact she's more perfect than a Stepford Wife with her wonderful family and reputable career. But when the diagnoses of Alzheimer's is given to her, how can she overcome the possible challenges? How will her family cope?What I liked aboutStill Alicewas how it not only talks about Alice's issue, but her family's as well, because they go through it along with her and even if they don't have Alzheimer's themselves, it still very much affects them. Does Alice ever fully overcome her fears and her struggles? Who's to say? But she's able to accept it and she learns that every day she has is meaningful and important, and her story, although fictional, is very inspiring.
