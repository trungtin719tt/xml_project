Serendipity. I like that word. It means: luck that takes the form of finding valuable or pleasant things that are not looked for.The Gargoyle was such a pleasant surprise. I admit that I bought this book for the cover. First for the beautiful tattoo on the woman's back and second for the title. I figured that the flaming red heart indicated a love story and I was ready for that. I read stories of vampires and wearwolfs and zombies throughout the year. I was ready for a gargoyle story. I couldn't quite imagine what it would be, but I was ready.I was not ready.I was not prepared.I was blindsided!I was transported into a story that I had no idea could be so facinating.The story is told in first person. I never got to know the man's name, but the rest of the characters are burned into my memory, even the dog.This was a story told within a story and all wrapped up beautifully at the end. Great stories, stand-alone stories so well integrated together that I COULD HARDLY BELIE THAT THIS WAS THE AUTHOR'S FIRST BOOK! Yes. It is true.I learned many things. I learned about the difference between a gargoyle and a grotesque. I learned about Italian and German literature translations of Dante'sInferno. I learned about modern medical practices in hospital burn wards and about schizophrenia and manic-depressive disorders. These things were parts of the story, but important. The rest was love.Yes, it was a love story.
