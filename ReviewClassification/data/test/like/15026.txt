Re-read: 2014This is the Fever book where shit gets all crazy.The walls are coming down, bitches!It's also the one where KMM dumps you at the end with a horrifying cliffhanger. In fact, the only cliffhanger that's worse than this one is the one in the next book,Dreamfever.Mac isn't a little whiny bitch anymore, Barrons is starting to show signs of cracking (in the sexy way!), Inspector Jayne gets hooked on Unseelie, Rowena shows her ass in spectacular fashion, and (unfortunately) Dani is the voice of a few of the chapters in this one.But that's ok, because...Barrons.Totally stole this image fromSh3lly's review!This was a great book to end this year on.And if you haven't jumped on the Fever bandwagon, you don't know what you're missing!Original Review: 2009Oh my God! This series is definitely a must-read! I can't believe the ending on this one! I can't believe how much I'm freaking out right now! I can't believe how many exclaimation points I just used!(Deep Breath) Read these books...they're good.
