Ooh, I loved it! It was amazing. It's kind of long, but there's so much happening, it needed to be that long. And it wasn't boring. I loved reading about the Egyptian gods. My favorite character was probably Bast.It's told as a recording. Sadie and Carter recorded their adventure and then Rick wrote it down. It kind of reminded me of Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events. Like the author believes that the story really did happen, and they're just the writer. Which is cool. Within the story there are inserts of Sadie and Carter bickering, telling each other to shut up or whatever as they tell their story. It was interesting. At first I didn't really like it, but near the end I enjoyed their antics. I liked seeing their relationship grow stronger, although they still like to tease each other. With the way they argue and interupt each other as they're telling the story, it seemed like there should have been an interuption from them practically every paragraph. Which would have gotten very old and annoying, so I'm glad Rick didn't overdo it, but I just felt like with their arguing, there would have been a heck of a lot more interuptions in the book.Rick does a really good job at developing his characters and keeping the pace of the story running with lots of action and surprises. And the little romances in it were cute. It definately kept my attention, and I ended up loving it. It's one of my new favorites :) I can't wait for the next books.
