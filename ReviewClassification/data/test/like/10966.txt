Final Review: I think out of all four books, I did like this one perhaps the most. It had less of Eragon moaning and complaining and more of him thinking for himself. I guess that shows he has matured? I will say that I really don't like reading about Roran. I think any plot line that contained Roran was wasted space. Sure, he is smart at war strategy, but we didn't need to read about it and it took up a large chunk in the last 3 books that really weren't necessary. And finally,(view spoiler)[I really didn't like the ending. It was unnecessary for Eragon to live the rest of his life in partial isolation just to train the new riders and dragons. If he does live for a thousand years or more like he stated in the book, he has plenty of time to visit people he loves and no reason to stay by himself in isolation. He has a dragon. He can fly and make long trips every so often. This isn't Lord of the Rings where Eragon was being sent to another place entirely by the Elves. Eragon has a way to and from. And what about all the wasted emotions on Arya for all 4 books!!! Why was it necessary, especially when Paolini kept them pointlessly apart?(hide spoiler)]Overall a decent book, but I was disappointed by the ending. I think Paolini thought to copy Tolkien a little too much and did not have a strong point to back up his ending.Initial Speculation: Okay, does it really say the title is Shur'tugal and that it will come out in 2011? I don't even remember if that is a word in the book and at this point I don't think I'm going to be rushing out to read it. It's been a huge wait for a story that I think is too long and full of unnecessary fillers. I am curious to see how Paolini will wrap this all up, though. I'm sad to say I will be glad to be done with it. Is that terrible of me or what?UPDATE from speculation:So I'm glad to see the title is Inheritance and it will come out this November! I guess the wait will soon be over.
