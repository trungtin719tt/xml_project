An enigmatic, nameless nightmare crawls silently out of the southern swamps and declares itself gentry. With stark and horrible inevitability, it creates its legacy in the same image as the mud from which it came, black, masked, impenetrable, yet reaching into a horror-stricken and helpless community to entwine a bride like a leviathan of the Mississippi marsh, drawing her back into its antebellum lair, she not wholly unwillingly. Mystery and strength entice no matter how shadowy and undignified, and sometimes even more so because of the shadow.This story, these dark images are delivered in the beautiful southern dialect with a power and mastery few possess, and that Faulkner possessed in spades. It is a small-scale story of the old South versus the new and those caught in the middle. It is the struggle to cling to a glorious and decaying past, a struggle to infiltrate an unwilling society that is a mere ghost of itself and a struggle to survive the clash between the two.
