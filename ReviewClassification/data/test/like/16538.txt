Yeah, it's happening, finally finished. It's funny I got halfway through this book in like a day then it took me over a week to read the second half, not due to a lack of interest, more the world around me suddenly got more exciting. See this is why friends suck, they get in the way of reading phenomenal books by making you have a life.Anyway, what I thought of this book. Well, FINALLY I learned about Roland's history. I mean sure I knew about Martin and his mother, and how he originally became a gunslinger, but the story of Susan and the town of Hambry, and of course Merlin's rainbow. There was just so much to digest in this book. I'm so happy I still have three left. It's going to be a sad day when I'm done with this series.This book was a real western romance, more so focusing on Roland and what made him the gunslinger he is when the reader is first introduced to him. Putting this in the fourth book really worked for me and really strengthened Roland's arc. I was more than familiar with the sorta man he had become, now I finally see the man he used to be and the human emotions he used to feel before hisobsessionpursuit of the dark tower.
