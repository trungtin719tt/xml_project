If you saw the movie before reading the book, you will not find many similarities in the movie and this book. the movie takes much of its content from the second Shopaholic book.I liked this book, I found it fun and quite humorous. I have to say I enjoyed the movie more than this first book.The character is a fun girl who has a real issue with her shopping habits. She is not very good with her money. This is a cute book.
