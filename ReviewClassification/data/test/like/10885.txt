My favorite book of all time! To me, it is just the perfect epic hero's journey story. I love that it takes place in the early 80s; I love the grittiness and ugliness of what happens to Jack as he travels back and forth between this world and The Territories, and I LOVE the character of Wolf.The first few chapters are a little slow and not very exciting, but they are important and hold crucial story points that will come into play later, so to anyone reading this for the first time, I recommend sticking it out and reading on...because it quickly turns to great once the story gets going! I could not put it down the first time I read it, which was in 6th grade.This is the only book, besides Catcher in the Rye, that I can pick up and just read a few chapters here and there when I feel like it. I don't need to read the whole book front to back anymore, but I do love just getting that taste every so often.I know I am paid to be a writer for my day job, but here's the thing: It's hard for me to write reviews, since I don't always know how to describe what makes a book "good" in a way that is eloquent and persuasive. Despite that, I do just want to make it known that this is, indeed, a VERY GOOD book. Read it. I'm open to discussing it with anyone.
