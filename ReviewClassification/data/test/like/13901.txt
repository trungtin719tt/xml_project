Terry Pratchett is a genius, as usual. This man can do no wrong. He reminds me a lot of Douglas Adams, my favorite in the realm of satire. Look at this similarity:"In the beginning the Universe was created. This has made a lot of people very angry and been widely regarded as a bad move."- Douglas Adams,The Restaurant at the End of the Universe"Disc philosophers agree that the First Men, shortly after their creation, understandably lost their temper."- Terry Pratchett,The Color of MagicThe Color of Magic tells the story of Rincewind, a cowardly fake wizard who happens to carry the most powerful spell in the Discworld in his mind. Rincewind is tasked with protecting Twoflower, a naive but totally loaded insurance agent out on a tour of the world, who has more luck in one day than anyone should rightfully have their whole lives. Joining the travelers is a multi-legged, man-eating, overprotective chest of luggage. The gods then play dice with their lives - literally. Chaos and hilarity ensue.My favorite character, indisputably the biggest BADASS of the book, was the Luggage. It follows Rincewind across the Disc and protects him from any threat. It also has the uncanny ability to convey emotions (mostly menace) without possessing any facial features. I'm eternally jealous of Twoflower for owning walking luggage - I have to drag my possessions everywhere.I love Terry Pratchett's ability to make fun of corruption, greed, cowardice, and other evils so common in the world without coming off as bitter or even very critical. He creates characters with many faults but makes them lovable anyway; Rincewind being the big example in this book.Besides that, Pratchett is insanely skilled at writing simple but funny prose.Some examples:"The door flew open, badly damaging the assassin who was standing beside it.""He drew his sword and, with a smooth overarm throw, completely failed to hit the troll.""Bel-Shamharoth screamed, a sound that started in the far ultrasonic and finished somewhere in Rincewind's bowels."I'm attempting a full Discworld series read-through, one book per month. Check back in just over two years to see if I'm done yet xD
