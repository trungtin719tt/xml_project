I first read this series when I was young, however I re read this series and the lost hero series a few months back and completely fell in love with it all over again, I love the fact the main character (Percy Jackson) is sassy and really funny (and so are the other characters) I loved Annabeth and her smarts but her emotions in the books, because she is a strong female character however in this book unlike the strong female trope Annabeth was not afraid to show her emotions like Hermione Granger.I loved Tyson the half brother Tyson (PEANUT BUTTER!!!) all in all I loved this series and the lost hero series and I recommend to anyone who loves Harry Potter.Bye For NowRavenclawAnnie03
