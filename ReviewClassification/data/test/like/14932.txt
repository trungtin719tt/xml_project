I did not like this story as much as book 4, which is by far my favorite so far (I am a sucker for memory-challenged Eric), but it was still an interesting tale. However, after having too many suitors, Sookie is fast running out of potential soul mates. Eric is back to being his old arrogant self, Bill is sulking around with a realtor, Alcide is freaked out Sookie killed his ex and blames her for his father's death and Sam is incapacitated from being shot (although they did share a heated moment in his office that Bill interrupted) While Sookie did meet the alluring Quinn (who I am sure will show up in future books) no major love interests have popped in. Which for me meant the storyline needed to be a bit tighter to fill in the lack of romantic gaps. However, the drama in this book was increidbly less after the previous stories filled with much death and destruction. Sookie having part of her house burned was sad, Tara's story a bit throw-away, but the climax, the packmaster duel at the end, was just disappointing in its fercoity rather than exhilarating in action. And the whole sniper against shifters and hit man after Sookie felt weak. Still better than book two's very weak story, but not as thrilling as the other novels.It will be interesting to see were things go with this. NOw that Eric knows the secret he and Sookie share will he act on it? And will Bill ever come around and wise up? Or Sam? And Alcide, who needs to stop blaming everyone else for his problems, he needs to grow up. Plus Jason is still an ass, caring more about his butt not being a suspect than his sister getting shot. All in all the men in Sookie's life leave much to be desired. She is still as spunky and great as ever, but needs better guys to work with.
