It would be an understatement to say that this book changed my life. Knowing this book and its author is my life. Just today I read Psalms 81 and Romans 5 and it breathed life and mystery into me for my day. I have learned to better love the Saviour and hero of this book, Jesus Christ, and what my identity and life is in him.I would say that this book best compares to the food and water that we need for our bodies. In the same way we desire more food and drink throughout our day, so in the same way I thirst for the words of this book and the author of them.it is also interesting to learn how many people have died for the preservation, diginity, and spreading of this powerful book. What makes it so consuming and dangerous? What compels people to die for it? It is simply a beautiful book that can change the hearts of men and women.
