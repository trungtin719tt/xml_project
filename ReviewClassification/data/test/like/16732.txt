"The grasshopper shall be a burden"-- The Man in the High Castle, Philip K. DickThis is one of those weird, unsettling novels that spins your brain in six or seven different directions.I read this PKD masterpiece almost two months ago, but only just recently returned to review it because after finishing, I wasn't ready to review. After I read more of him, I realized that even when he is messy, strange, disjointed and sometimes yes &gt;&gt;touched&lt;&lt; Philip K Dick is one MuthaF'er that definitely can write and can definitely write his readers into circles. He bends time, switches alliances, inverts us until we find we don't recognize our own reflection or past.Reading 'The Man in the High Castle', I was reminded of a time when I was in High School in Germany. At the time, I was very flexible (think Abraham Lincoln meets, falls in love, and produces offspring with Gumbi) and decided to jump/fall/roll off the high dive platform with both legs wrapped around my head while standing on my hands. I rolled forward spinning head-chasing-ass (my knees were my axis of rotation) until I hit the water. At that moment my legs seemed to float from my head to their normal bipedal position, but my legs seem to not exist in a normal sense and I had no sense of North, South, Up or Down. It was embryonic and yes probably moronic, but it is exactly how I felt putting this novel down.Anyway, a fantstic dystopian/alternate history novel that if possible should be read with Philip Roth's also brilliantThe Plot Against America. At least that is how I feel now about reading him then, but time has moved on, and I might just be remembering wrong.
