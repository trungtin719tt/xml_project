SHAKESPEARE WANTS YOU TO BREED!!!!The first 17 or so sonnets in the series left me taken aback. It's right there in the first line of Sonnet #1:1. From fairest creatures we desire increaseThat thereby beauty's Rose might never dieBut as the riper should be time deceaseHis tender heir might bear his memoryThere's this obsession with propagating the species. This concern about breeding dominates the first 17 sonnets in the series, something I had not been aware of before.2. ...How much more praise deserv'd thy beauty's useIf thou couldst answer, 'This fair child of mineShall sum my count, and make my old excuse'3. Look in the glass, and tell the face thou viewestNow is the time this face should form another4. ....Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,What acceptable audit canst thou leave?6. ....That's for thyself to breed another thee7. .....So thou, thyself outgoing in thy noon,Unlooked on diest, unless thou get a son.8. ...mark how one string, sweet husband to another,Strikes each in each by mutual ordering;Resembling sire and child and happy mother,...Sings this to thee, "Thou single will prove none".9. ...Ah if thou issueless shalt hap to die,the world will wail thee, like a makeless wife..No love towards others in that bosom sitsThat on himself such murd'rous shame commits.10. ...Make thee another self, for love of me,that beauty still may live in thine or thee.11. ...Let those whom nature hath not made for store,Harsh, featureless, and rude, barrenly perish....She carv'd thee for her seal, and mean therebyThou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.Actually, as a gay man, I find that "harsh, featureless, and rude" pretty offensive. It continues:12. ...And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defencesave breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.13. ...Against this coming end you should prepare,And your sweet semblance to some other give.14. ...If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;Or else of thee this I prognosticate:Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.17. ...But were some child of yours alive that time,You should live twice, in it and in my rime.Fortunately, #18 is the glorious "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?", and from here on out it appears to be smooth sailing.But that battery of breeder-boosting that opens this collection was a little off-putting, to say the least. It seems so dismissive of those of us who were put on earth to carry out some other purpose, somehow.But this is neither here nor there. This book contains some of the most awesome language in the entire body of English literature. To assign it a rating seems entirely presumptuous; nothing but 5 stars seems even conceivable.My favorite, if forced to choose, is a conventional one:#29.When, in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes,I all alone beweep my outcast state,...Haply I think on thee --- and then my state,Like to the lark at break of day arisingFrom sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;Quite apart from the theme of the poem, how he changes mood with just that single line "like to the lark at break of day arising" astonishes me every time I read it.
