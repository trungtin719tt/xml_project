This is a tough one to review. Not because it isn't a good book, the writing and the details in the historical events provided is exceptional. It's tough because I believe I am just emotionally exhausted by the amount of similar stories I have digested in the last year. Late last year I read "Blood and Thunder", early this year I finished "Trail of Tears", and at this time, even though it is fiction (it is historical fiction) I am re-reading "Blood Meridian". It is so much information that I realized I already knew most of the details in this telling. This time around it wasn't so much that I was learning something new as it was rubbing an old sore.I really believe I can look at this history with an impartial mind. I am part Irish, part Norwegian, and part Cherokee Indian, but what I am above and beyond all those labels is an American in the 21st century. I think that the most disheartening thing about these facts is that they reveal a serious flaw in all of humankind. How can we treat each other like this? Will we ever evolve to a point where we can overcome the pure animal cruelty that resides within us?King Arthur (or was it Merlin) made the statement in T.H. White's "Once and Future King" that "might does not make right". Well, sorry sir knight, but the good ol' US of A has proved that wrong... as did the Romans, the Egyptians, and so on... We saw something we wanted, enacted Manifest Destiny, and the rest is history. We had more soldiers and better weapons, so our ideas were right, our laws were right, our means justified the ends, and our religion (predominately Christian) was the one true religion. The Indians were an obstacle, and under the banner of old glory and the Christian cross, we wiped them out; men, women and children.The remaining survivors of the Massacre at Wounded Knee were brought to the Pine Ridge Agency just a couple of days after Christmas. The wounded, traumatized, freezing, starving remnants were stored in an empty Episcopal Mission. in the rafters over their heads were the remains of holiday decorations and a streamer that read, "PEACE ON EARTH, GOOD WILL TO MEN".
