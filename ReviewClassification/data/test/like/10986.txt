Holy Shit! American Psycho meets Lord of the flies with a little bit of Countryfile thrown in! It took me one commute to read this book and it may be telling of my own psyche that I didn't actually consider Frank to be that crazy. Eric the dog burner was blatantly bat shit crazy but Frank, despite his slightly odd proclivities relating to the collection of animal heads on sticks and wasps in "future telling" mazes appeared to be eccentric at best. Ok he did have a fairly alarming body count under his belt but he justified it with kind of rationale that implied a kind of out the other side of sanity and into sociopath territory. Anyway, comparatively when you examine his home environment with his dad and his brother and his allegedly crazy mother it's not surprising he was off the normal spectrum. I enjoyed this quick and easy read and it's another one knocked off the 1001 books list.
