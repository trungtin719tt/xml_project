My daughter, Sarah, (8 years old, but a great reader) and I have loved this book, as well as its sequel, Rise of the Evening Star. She is currently reading the third, Grip of the Shadow Plague because she snatched it up before I could! Brandon Mull (another LDS author...they seems to be everywhere...) has created a vibrant fantasy series with great characters and snappy dialogue. Because there are both a brother and sister at the center of the intrigue, this will appeal to both boys and girls (the sister is older, and the most central character, but the brother is brave and boasting and thoroughly delightful). The kids are farmed off to Grandma and Grandpa's house, only to discover that they are caretakers for a preserve of magical creatures. All sorts of mischief and mayhem ensues. There are some scary/tense moments, when you have small doubts about everyone's safety, but only enough to keep the story compelling. (One time, during the first book, Sarah came to me and asked me to finish reading the chapter with her because, "it's freaking me out!" We finished it together, and all was well.) The vocabulary is challenging, the plot is complex enough to demand careful attention from readers, and there is a thoughtful reading guide in the back to aid in discussions. A great foray into thoughtful readings of difficult books.
