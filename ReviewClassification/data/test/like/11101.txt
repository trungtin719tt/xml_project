Congratulations Mr. Westerfeld, you managed to impress me, amaze me, and convince me to read the third book.When I finished "Uglies" (the first book in the series), I was really impressed and looking forward to reading "Pretties". 20% into the book, I was starting to feel depressed. What I had hoped for wasn't happening. There was no strong female protagonist, there was nothing new. Well, nothing new except for a new relationship with another boy. Aaaargh! I was worried that I was going to end up with another girl unable to choose between Edward/Jacob Peta/Gale situation. And then everything changed.I should have trusted the author a lot more. The book quickly became a page turner. Once again I was sent on a wild ride. New situations, new characters were introduced - and not just for the sake of trying to make the book seem different to its predecessor, these things occurred to drive the plot forward. They slowly revealed that the author has a much bigger plan for this story, a story that he intends to unwind slowly.I am off to read book three - and this time I intend to be more patient while reading the first third!
