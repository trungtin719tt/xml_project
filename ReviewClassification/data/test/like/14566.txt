Hanff's little book of letters to and from the book shop Marks &amp; Co, is a little gem. It illustrates the love of books with a passion that cannot be disguised as much as the author might try with her delightful wit.The letters span twenty years as Ms. Hanff acquired the library she could not find in American bookshops. Her tastes ran to English literature, most preferably non-fiction. She did not care to read a volume of history by someone who had not lived through the times about which she wished to learn. She did succumb to fiction after reading "Pride and Prejudice."Hanff appreciated the beauty of an elegantly bound book. She abhorred the cardboard covers of American bookbinders. If the contents were worthy of reading, they should be suitably presented. Her descriptions of heavy vellum papers, gilt edged pages with fine press print are a tribute to the lasting value of the written word. She is as happy with a book that falls open to a passage that attracted the attention of some unknown reader as she is overcome with the joy of cutting the untouched pages of fine India papers.But Hanff is not simply a bibliophile, she is a generous woman, who sends parcels of foods still subject to rationing in post World War Two London to the booksellers at Marks &amp; Co. It is not only her love of the books she buys but her value of people whom she has never met that make this little classic the lasting charmer that it is.The unreserved Helene Hanff and the quite reserved Frank Doel form a very special friendship through their letters. We also come to know the other booksellers at Marks &amp; Co, Frank's wife Nora, and their children.For anyone who has ever developed a true friendship with a good bookseller, the charming magic of Helene's and Frank's correspondence will come as no surprise, but an expectation. It is a bit sad to recognize that the writing of letters has become an almost lost practice.When you lose yourself in the pages of this slender volume, you may question our current state of instant communication through texting, tweeting, and posting your grocery list on Facebook. What appears in "84,Charing Cross Road" reminds us of the texture of a page, the heft of a good binding, and the knowledge that some works will never hold their magic flashing up on a flat screen in electronic ink.There is always something unbelievably sad about a former owner's library up for grabs at an estate sale. My copy of this little book came from the shelves of a professor of literature and folklore. It was surrounded by many of the same titles collected by Helene Hanff. The written word connects us all from generation to generation. It is the common bond of humanity.Helene Hanff reminds us of that with wit, love, grace and generosity.
