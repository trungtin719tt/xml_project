Pop sugar Reading Challenge 2019--A book that makes you nostalgic.This book would get a 5, but for the ending. Which I don't hate as much as some.This is a wonderfully descriptive book. I absolutely hate Annie and Diane (I'm still trying to figure out if there names being so similar is on purpose, but I'm no good at that kind of stuff), but still manage to love the book as a whole. Grace and Pilgrim's journeys of healing are so inspirational and touching.
