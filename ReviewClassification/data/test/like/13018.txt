I am very cross. This is yet another book that I rated and reviewed and has disappeared from my shelves. I wonder if it happened when some librarian decided to add series information to it and thereby change the title? If it is no. 1 in a series there has to be a no. 2. There isn't. It isn't a series. According to Wikipedia,"A Canticle for Leibowitz is based on three short stories Miller contributed to The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction.[1][2] It is the only novel published by the author during his lifetime.."That's pretty conclusive isn't it?Maybe it wasn't that, maybe it is the GR monster that GR are content to let feed on our shelves.
