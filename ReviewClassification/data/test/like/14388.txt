It's a classic read from both "eyes" of the era it was written and also the place/time that encompasses the copy of Christy's tale of coming to the mountains to be teacher.It's very long- at least 2 books length. Yet because it embraces so many myriad aspects of Christy's life, schoolhouse and entire mixes of associations in Cutter Gap locale- it still delights.Because I did not read this when I was young, I was surprised at the reviews which some specify as "romantic". I didn't feel that was the core of this at all. Hardly a finalizing sideline either.But it was written in the style of inspiration, faith, respect, aspirations for good intent, and overwhelming affinity for kindness (sour language/ foul wording/ angry ire as common "attitude" in speech either missing altogether or defined by characters as "mean" and unacceptable which would be accurate for what they are).Some of the defining characteristics of the hillbilly populations of poorest mountain side and holler folks are more considered and evaluated to purpose and habit here (even to defined sociology, anthropology or economic based terms or measures) than in the supposedly "excellent" self-identity based non-fiction tracts of the post 2010 era. Especially one or two from the most recent 2016-2018 years.Regardless of the travails, the wildness, the hardships and conditions described in this book- it is still always a positive directed voice. For me, essentially cored in a peaceful role model, and entirely entertaining to read.I will probably read some of her others now, like A Man Called Peter.
