FINAL REVIEWJust...How did Marie Lu just wrap up this amazing series with an ever more so amazing book?!This book makes we want to do this:This: BECAUSE MY BRAIN ISN'T WORKING AFTER READING THIS, like NO!This: OUT OF SHEER PERFECTIONAnd this all over again:To explain the awesomeness that is the book, I must start when I saw this book at the public library.^ Yeah that was me. Deal with it.Then came the reading. Big mistake of starting it when I had work to do because guess what I did instead of doing work? Yup! Just reading!The plot. The characters. The world building. The flow, the action, the pace. DO I EVEN NEED TO SAY IT?! Do you question its amazingness?The twists, the turns, the journey that each character takes: It makes me just want to sob out of happiness.4 Main Characters that I want to mention:- Eden - AHHH!!!! HE IS SO PERFECT AND AWESOME AND AMAZING. His relationship with Day made me tear up.- Anden - LOVE HIM. What a refreshing character. And I usually do not like the characters who interfere with my OTP, but Anden is an exception.- June - Do I even need to say it? June is honestly my favorite. She is stunning, intelligent, caring, strong. And she is logical! LOGICAL! She actually thinks! And she does things because she weighs both her emotions and intelligence.- Day - Great character. Marie Lu just stop making such impeccable characters. Just please stop. Otherwise, you are going to give endless emotions to your readers and make them extremely unproductive because they are too busy crying into their pillows out of happiness.Not only are the characters amazing, Marie Lu doesn't pull a Mockingjay. Not that I don't like Mockingjay or anything, but that ending was not satisfactory. But not Champion. It will leave you satisfied, but unable to think, and then it will leave you crying tears of happiness as you shake the book wondering why it ended.The world building is amazing. For someone who is in love with politics and government, I was completely fascinated by the world within the Legend series and Champion only dives further into the world. Just absolute perfection and love.Finally,Day and June: ULTIMATE OTPYeah, I just ripped off the title of the first book. I don't care becauseAnd to the end:Yes. Yes. So do I.All I can say is: GO READ IT! AND GO READ THIS SERIES!!! It is so freaking amazing that you will be sending me gifts in thanks for recommending this series to you, because it is THAT GOOD.I kind of am shocked that I even was able to write this review because my brain is kind of overloaded and fried from the awesomeness. If any part of the review does not make sense: blame that. I think I kind of rambled on. Oh well, I am just going to cry in a corner now because this wonderful series has now come to an end. I'm done.BeforeGUYS. The date has been moved to 2013. I repeat. 2013. HALLELUJAH!!!And this cover. ERMERGERD.2014.2014.2014.Ice cream is always my solution.
