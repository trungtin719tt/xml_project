Reading this again taught me how much better a writer Charlaine Harris is than the writers of the "True Blood" series on HBO. In the TV series, Bill's sheriff vampire, tall blond Eric, cries out to Sookie that he has two silver bullets in him and they must be removedimmediately. They're in his shoulder and chest, and she had no surgical devices or tweezers, so she ends up sucking them out, getting Eric's blood in her mouth (which was his point). One of them is in Eric's breast, near the nipple, which is what Sookie's doing when Bill arrives. In the book, Eric has only one bullet; Sookie gets a little blood in her mouth; it doesn't turn into a Roman carnival.The same with the maenad's arrival. The show turns it into days' worth of carousing by the entire population of Bontemps. In the book, it's an affair for Sam, the vampires (who owe her tribute), and a small, nasty sex club.It's nice to re-read the books along with the series to remind myself how sensible the charactersreallyare. As for the show . . . I can't help myself. I'm so ashamed.
