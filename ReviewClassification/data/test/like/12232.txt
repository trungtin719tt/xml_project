I may have incurred a heart related illness after reading this. My heart constantly kept bouncing up and down, back and forth the whole time I was reading this.If this book were a movie, I would be jumping off my seat and loudly cheering on the characters I've come to admire and respect.(Day and June have now officially become my most beloved dystopian pair.)The feelings were so hard to contain, I should be allowed to let one escape so- "woohooo!!! Kaede!!!, you're yet one of the most unforgettable heroes in this book."The entire direction of the story, the plot and the twists simply left me in awe. It also made me spill a few drops of tears. I love, love, love this book and can't wait to get my hands on the sequel. ;)
