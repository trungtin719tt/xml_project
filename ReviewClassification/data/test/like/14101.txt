You know when you have someone who is constantly trying to get you to read a certain book because they KNOW you will love it? Well, that is why I decided to read this one. BUT, after I read it and told her that I liked it, she told me that this is NOT the series she was talking about. oops! haha, too bad! I like this one, so far, and now I guess she will have to wait (and nag me) even longer until I get to the series she meant for me to read. (Dark Hunter?)Also, she warned me to only read this series for around 8 books because then things take a left turn and it's all porn and no story.I don't know why she's so happy about it, but okay. Whatever floats your boat.That seems odd to me since there was absolutely no sex in this book at all. But, I'll take her advice. The person in question is my daughter. If she warns her mother about porn, then I guess I've done something right. ;)So, everyone knows about Anita Blake, Vampire Hunter. Do I really need to tell you what it's about? No.I'll just tell you what I liked about it.First off, there is tons of action and blood. I like action and blood. Within a couple of pages we get our hero stuck in a dungeon with a bunch of vampires that may or may not kill her. I was pretty optimistic that she would live considering she has an entire series devoted to her, but still. Dungeons are cool - especially when they contain killer-wererats, a homicidal vampire child, and an evil circus going on upstairs. Of course, in my opinion all circus's are evil. I mean, come on---clowns. *shiver*Clowns have streets named after them in HellSecondly, I liked that Anita is a smartass who makes jokes at inappropriate moments.A lot of people don't get my jokes. If I was less secure, I'd think my jokes weren't funny. Naw.I can relate to that. My jokes don't always land. I've heard the phrase "too soon" many a times.Anita is no Kate Daniels - the benchmark for all smartass heroines in my book - but she is amusing. I love characters who make me laugh.And, lastly, I liked the world with all of its scary creatures set in our modern times. Although, when I say "modern", I am using the term loosely. These books were written a while back and Anita actually has a pager and uses pay phones. O_oSo, I will keep reading this series for a few books.... until I start hearing bowm-chicka-bow-wow. Then, I'm out.
