By far my favorite book of Jodi Picoult's. I thought Plain Truth was my number one, but after reading The Pact, I've found a new number one! At first I wasn't sure that I would like the way the book was laid out with the "Now" &amp; "Then", switching back and forth. But I came to realize after I was continuing to read and finished the book, that's what made the book so great. I loved going back "Then" because it gave you the truth and a walk through their life and how they became to where they are "Now". I really enjoyed this book. I was so engrossed in it everytime I read it. I couldn't put it down and got very amped when I could read it! It was a happy/tragic journey reading this book, and it is something that could happen. It was amazing how you could actually feel how the characters felt and understand their pain just through words. I can't get into everything I'd like in this review without spoiling anything for other people. This is a must read book!
