*Slight Spoilers*This review will be short and to the point. If ya loved Bared to You then you'll love this story. If you're not a fan then get gone.Reflected in You is appropriately named for Gideon and Eva. Reflected in each other is Obsession, Jealousy, Possession, Love, Addiction and Heartbreak.Gideon has STAMINA! I could never tire on how "big" his STAMINA is. Once again, I love the visuals my mind conjured up.Ms. Day writes awesome sensuality and smokin' sex scenes...in the shower(my fave), at a concert(oh boy), limo(very intense) or joining the mile high. She takes us to another level in their relationship whether it was good or bad, I enjoyed the ride. Other characters new and old come into play and maybe we can get side stories on them.Favorite lines/moments:Gideon woke up ready to conquer the world, and liked to start that domination with me.He was my drug, and I had no desire to kick the habit."You can be good for me, Gideon," I told him softly. "I don't know how I could ever forget that. Even for a minute.""See something you like?" he purred, pleasuring himself."Oh my God," I breathed, riveted. "You are so fucking hot."The gleam in his eyes told me he knew what he was doing to me. His free hand slid slowly up his ridged abdomen and squeezed his pectoral, making me jealous. "Could you come watching me?"Me thinking to myself...Fuck Yeah!Reaching for my hand, he lefted it to his lips and kissed my fingertips. "I love you.""I'm obsessed with you, angel. Addicted to you. You're everything I've ever wanted or needed, everything I've ever dreamed of. You're everything. I live and breathe you. For you."All in all...I effin loved it!
