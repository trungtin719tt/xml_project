This book almost ruined my education.Seriously, whilst I was supposed to be doing homework, I spent three hours reading this.When I was supposed to be studying for a maths test, I read this.During science, english, Religion, Drama and Humanities lessons...I read this.It was that amazing.For the past week, I have not been asleep before 1AM, because I have been reading this thriller.And well after I turn of the light in the early hours of the morning, Angels And Demons clouds my thoughts.One word to describe this book is unputdownable.Because it really is.I finished this book on the way home from school today.And I was walking home.What a sorry sight I must have been, school bag on back, in full uniform, walk 1.5 kilometers form school to home, and not even looking up from the pages once.I finished with about 100 meters left to walk.I lovedThe Da Vinci Code, butAngels &amp; Demonswas way better.It was smart, thrilling, mysterious, adventurous, scary, intense,....and Unputdownable.The only reason it did not receive full marks from me, is because the majority of the first 130 pages, at the CERN labs. All that science talk, particle theory and antimatter flew right over my head. Unfortunately, that made the book in-eligible for full marks.And theTwists!.Oh my, the twists and turns in this book blew me away. Just when you think you know where the story is headed, something happens and the whole plot is thrown into organized chaos.As did the action scenes.And the mystery.And the writing style.Yeah....pretty much everything was exceptional.I espcially liked the realisim.The real life locations, the Illuminati, CERN....All based upon fact.Dan Brown, I tip my hat to you.You have penned a fantastic read.
