I don't usually read books aimed at the tween age crowd, but I remember my brother telling me my niece loves this series. If this had been out when I was a kid, I would have been crazy about it too. Even at age 41, I really enjoyed it. I thought the premise of the book was really cute, the story was fast paced and interesting. I've been calling my cats "kitty-pets" all week. There's a bazillion of these books in the series, I don't know that I'll read all of them, but I'll definitely tackle the next few.
