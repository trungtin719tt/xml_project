I loved it just as much as I remember loving it when I was 12. SO good. Quirky, poignant, hopeful, and warm. Filled with big hearted characters (Gramps and Gram are OTP), humor, and some serious heartbreak, too. It so beautifully portrays a young girl's journey growing up, growing wiser, and learning to accept the past and hope for the future. I absolutely loved it. Also, it's a roadtrip story - who doesn't love a roadtrip story?
