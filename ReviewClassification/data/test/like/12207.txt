I've only read oneDean Koontzthriller before and didn't really enjoy it so I wasn't expecting to enjoy this so much. Not only does Koontz spin a good tale, but Odd Thomas is such an original character, it's hard not to like him. He's a gentle soul, a cheerful short order fry chef in the small town of Pico Mundo in southern California, who wants to marry his high school sweetheart Stormy Llewellyn and is contented with his life. He's almost normal except for one special skill: he can see the dead. Some, like Elvis, just don't want to move on and others seek him out wanting justice for wrongful deaths. Odd can also see strange ghost-like beings hanging around those who are going to die so when his town becomes invaded with these beings he gets a very bad feeling.I enjoyed the way the tension built up slowly in this thriller as Odd tries to work out why these strange ghosts are in his town. I loved his girlfriend, Stormy who is the perfect partner for him with her quirky ideas and I liked the Chief of Police who quietly accepts that Odd sees the dead and trusts him when he has a bad feeling. Definitely a less violent tale than I was expecting, told with a bit of humour and some sadness at the end.
