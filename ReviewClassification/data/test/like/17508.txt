If you like "A Boy Called 'It'" I'm pretty sure you'll like this book, too. It's the autobiographical account of a life so horrible that it's almost hard to believe except that in my counseling practice I have run across a few--just a few--clients with similar backgrounds so I find this woman's account entirely credible. Plus her story in internally consistent, from a psychology perspective. But if you had any semblance of a functional or decent childhood, it will be hard to fathom that anyone can survive a life like this.This book will be valuable for anyone who's curious about how childhood abuse can continue to destroy a person for their rest of their lives if untreated. It's very easy to read (the writing style, that is) so it should also appeal to anyone who likes to read cathartic stories. And I hope the peace she finds by the end of the book is a lasting one.
