What is it with me and reading poetry/poetic prose in December? Last wonderful December, I really enjoyed Ariel by Sylvia Plath. Going through some things and I wanted to read something human , something personal for catharsis, to let it all go and I was about to reread Forbidden again when I chose this. Blew me away, such rawness. I'll say this and I'll say it again . Books help, they heal. Never stop reading.Oddly enough, the MC here reminded me of the one in Underwater by Marisa Reichardt. But what I really loved about this novel was that it had no real ending. I like that. Because life does not have an ending. And if you think Death is an end, then I am afraid you haven't been paying much attention.
