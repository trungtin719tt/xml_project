Thirteen-year-old Salamanca Tree Hiddle is driving across the country to Lewiston, Idaho with her grandparents on a journey to find her mother, who left the past year. As they journey, she tells her grandparents the story of her friend, Phoebe, who she met when her father made them move away from their farm after her mother left. Phoebe's story is a sad and mysterious one, and as Salamanca weaves her tale, the gaps are filled in on her own story, and about her mother.Heartbreaking and sad, and yet filled with hope and closure, this story is a beautiful one to introduce loss and other hard things ("The Birds of Sadness") to children. I loved it, and I especially loved all the characters, from her grandparents, to her quirky friends.I read this for the first time in 2001, but I just reread it because it is one of my son's Battle of the Books books, and I loved revisiting the story.
