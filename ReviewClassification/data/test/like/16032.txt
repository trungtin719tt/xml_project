I don't like to see bad things happen to people or animals. Although I cringe when I think of an animal that has been hurt, I like to see it restored. The author tells a story of a young girl and her girlfriend on an early winter morning ride where tragedy strikes. Lives were lost. However some lived but with incredible injuries. The horse and rider + family must go through a restoration with the help of a man who has a gift with horses. The setting is beautiful Montana.
