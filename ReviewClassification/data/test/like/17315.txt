The cover says.."Grand..Grandiose..Compelling" and I must agree wholeheartedlyI just finished this huge classic wonderful piece of engrossing fiction based on the beginning of WWII history. It begins in 1939. Vicariously through a military family named the Henry's, we get more than a birds eye view of how things manifested. In this book, I swear, every page you feel as though you must have taken a trip back in time. I chose this book because I'm quite attracted to WWII fiction but I wanted to read something where someone tells me why? What was it like before? How did it get to the point of war and why? I know it was Europe &amp; Pacific but how and why? This book tackles all of my curious questions all rolled up into a family saga with romance, adventure, countless facts and irresistible story. What can I say? It was over a thousand pages. There is too much to say. But I enjoyed every bit of it. I learned so much. It made me even more intrigued and caused me to do online historical research. What more can be asked for when it comes to Historical Fiction? To be entertained and learn at the same time is everything I love about this genre.I have the second book and look forward to starting it soon. This book stops at 1941 as the Henry's and the United States get into the war. I look forward to the second book to learn more about my country's involvement and the Henry's in the war.I give this 6 stars. Pretty close to perfect for me. I will read more books by this author. He is definitely to be heralded for such a saga, such a large successful work. I do recommend this to real Historical Fiction lovers and those who are willing to give some time to its 1047 pages..but you won't be sorry for devoting the time. I'm going to be jumping back in soon.
