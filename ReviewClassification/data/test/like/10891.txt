In 2019 I'm going to go back and review the King books I love and cherished but never fully reviewed for Goodreads because Goodreads wasn't a thing when I was reading King's work in the 90s. You can follow along on Instagram #ReviewKing2019The Talisman is my favorite author collaboration. Two of my favorite authors, Straub &amp; King, combined their unique storytelling voices to pen one of my all time favorite, dark fantasies.I first read this on a family vacation to Dillon Beach, CA. We rented a house called, "Wit's End". It was the perfect setting for this story about a young boy who lives with his mother in a seaside town, I'll tell you that much.I remember being a little confused by the storyline as soon as Jack Swayer enters "The Territories". I've never been good at that sort of parallel universe thing. But King and Straub did some amazing world building here and I do remember enjoying the journey Jack goes on and all the different characters that were introduced--most memorably, Wolf.I decided to pull this book down off the shelf and revisit portions of the story to refresh my memory. I re-read PART I: Jack Lights Out (pages 1-68) and I fell in love all over again with Jack and his mentor, Speedy Parker. There are SO MANY connections to the Dark Tower in this book that I totally missed the first time around because I hadn't even finished the series back then. Which just belabors the point that someday, I'm going to have to re-read everything just to get the full scope of the Stephen King universe. I read everything out of order and all the special Easter eggs and tie-ins would never be discovered like that, you know?So Speedy is actually a gunslinger. In Jack's world-our world, he's just an old man that teaches Jack how to "flip" back and forth between worlds but in The Territories, Speedy Parker is a GUNSLINGER named Parkus! WHOA! Mind blown.Also re-read portions of PART II: The Road of Trials-especially the parts with Wolf. I love Wolf. Both Straub and King (but more so King) have a real zest for writing animals, kids and friendships.There's a quote in the beginning of the book by Mark Twain from Huckleberry Finn and I think the relationship between Jack &amp; Wolf was very Huckleberry-ish.Also, I had forgotten all about Richard Sloat and now that I have remembered him again, I can safely say that Jake and Richard are one of my favorite friendships.Do ya ken?And here's the part that really blows my mind: Jack Sawyer reminds me SO MUCH of that little boy in THE WIND THROUGH THE KEYHOLE! So I looked it up!That protagonist in KEYHOLE was named Tim Ross and on a DARK TOWER Wiki site, I saw lots of people drawing the same conclusions--could Tim Ross be a "Twinner" of Jack? We are told that Jack had a Twinner named Jason but he died and it almost killed Jack, right?But read this from the Wiki site:"Both characters bear major resmbelence in appearance, age and character traits, as well as the circumstances of how their stories play out. Both characters must go on a great quest in order to find a magical artifact that will heal their mothers from serious ailments; The father of each character was murdered by their own step father; Jack and Tim are accompanied by a Wolf and a Tyger on their respective quests; it is told that Tim grew up to be a Gunslinger known as Tim Stoutheart and it is revealed in "Black House" that Jack grew up to be a Police Officer. Roland often mistakes Police Officers for Gunslingers."I dunno, I just thought it was cool and I could see myself getting way too sucked into Wiki-Fandom theories about Dark Tower connections and Twinners and I just can't do it, guys!!Anyways, I loved reading portions of this book so much that I really will do a re-read of this and BLACK HOUSE someday.I'm not changing my score. This is still a five star read for me.
