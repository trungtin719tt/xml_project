I. loved. this. book. What more is there to say? Of course I had my dislikes, but that's one of the signs of a well-rounded story in my opinion. The characters were so human, but they all strived to be more and do more. It was enchanting to read while being the same age as Christy (19). Cutter Gap has so many quirks and such personality it's hard not to like it among all the backward thinking and poverty. I enjoyed Christy's journey of faith as it was very blunt and realistic--she didn't shy away from the difficult, ugly, or the lovely. Plus, she was one of the only stubborn, idealist main characters that hasn't annoyed me to death. I loved how everyone was in a different place in their faith and approach to life, but they all had to come together so many times, often just to survive. It gave me lots to think about and I was smiling by the end. I'm so glad I finally read this classic!I recommend this for ages 16+ due to some graphic details of illnesses, injuries, and crude living conditions, some suggestive and disturbing behavior, and some sensuality.(view spoiler)[ A seduction and rape is recounted with enough detail to unsettle readers. There is also some conversation between adults about sex education, how natural it is, and how uncomfortable the idea makes Christy. Otherwise, a few undetailed kisses.(hide spoiler)]None of the content takes away from my rating because for me it wasn't too much detail, and it was all written in a forthright but gentle way, although they could have gotten away with less several times.
