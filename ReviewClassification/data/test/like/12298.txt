Sometimes I'm in the middle of complaining to Joanne that some book, which I told Joanne before I started was probably going to be boring and stupid, is indeed boring and stupid, and I plan to complain about it being boring and stupid for the next week because it's also long, and Joanne says silly things like "Why would you even start a book that you think will be boring and stupid?" Ivanhoe is why! Sometimes I'm wrong. I thought Ivanhoe would be boring and stupid, but it's a blast.Flesh WoundsHere's the test for whether you'll like it: have you ever liked any story - even just one story - with a knight in it? If you're not totally immune to knights clanking about flinging gauntlets at each other, you should like Ivanhoe. It's the apotheosis of knight-bashing. There are:- damsels in distress, and a terrific response by one of them;- a great scheming old crone in a tower;- a wicked prince;- a thrilling castle siege (and note: those are usually not thrilling, it's just super hard to write large-scale battle scenes that work, but here you go!);- mystery knights in black;- a lusty brawling priest;- even an outlaw bowman dressed in green. (Is his identity supposed to be a secret? Because it's not, neither is the Black Knight's.)If none of those things sound fun to you....well, we can still readMansfield Parktogether.Uh-oh, JewsThe one thing I should mention that doesn't sit perfectly with me is (sigh, here we go again) Isaac the Jew. And look, Scott's major point, which he makes again and again, is how awful bigotry towards Jews is (well, was, in 1200). He's constantly showing people being dicks to Isaac and then writing things like "Man, he sure is being a dick to that poor Jew!" He uses the word "bigot" like 50 times. Buuuuut, the fact remains that Isaac is indeed a craven caricature, aBarabas,so one gets the unsettling impression that Scott is having it both ways.I mean, Scott actually explains it: he's like, "We've left this poor race no place in society but as money-lenders, we've constantly oppressed them, it's our fault they've become avaricious; we don't allow them to be anything else!" And you're like ehhhhhh, man, but didn't you make Isaac up in your own brain? I dunno. I'm vexed by the portrayal of Isaac. I don't get super hater vibes; I kinda suspect Scott is doing his best and it's just sortof an ass-headed effort. But prospective readers are due a warning: depending on your own feelings, you may find this totally unobjectionable or incredibly offensive. He's a major character.Walter Scott in ContextScott is sometimes called the inventor of historical fiction. He's also sometimes called shitty; EM Forster says that "To make things happen one after another is his only serious aim." Scott can't do characters; he can't even do plots. He just presents a series of scenes. "He has the power to present the outside of a character and to work from the outside to the inside," says Pritchett. "But once inside, he discovers only what is generic." But then there's David Lodge calling Scott "the single Shakespearean talent of the English novel."All of these things are hyperbole. It's true that characterization is not Scott's strong point - lot of archetypes here - but everyone's entertaining and memorable enough; it's okay not to be a psychologist. Scott's super fun to read, and that's great....and in Central ParkFor some reason Central Park has a statue of him, which I went to visit as I read Ivanhoe. Here it is:Over on the other side - in shade, so the pic I took from that side doesn't show it at all - is his dog. He looks like a nice guy, doesn't he? I like him.
