The FallbyAlbert Camusis the monologue of a breathless individual whose phrases follow each other in a frantic rhythm, giving himself up to an attentive interlocutor. The confessions of a man gnawed by the guilt of not having reacted to the suicide of a young woman who has been thrown from a bridge.This guilt will awaken his human conscience..Jean Baptiste Clamence, a vain and self-centered bourgeois, a renowned advocate, whom his good calculated actions distinguish, will abandon his rich Parisian life, his work following the suicide of a young woman. He then decides to reverse his role by positioning himself on the bench of the accused in order to judge himself without duplicity.He therefore exiled himself to Holland, a cold, hostile rocky country which he described as the gates of Hell.Clamence wants to repent of his sins, he becomes an observer, contemplates human ignominy, but he suffers, gets drunk and rubs shoulders with unfamiliar places. He takes a position as a penitentiary judge in a bar in Mexico City where he publicly confesses himself and accuses himself of the faults of humanity in order to send them back to his interlocutors hoping that they themselves will become aware of their mistakes.Thus, like a prophet in full redemption, he grants himself the right to judge men (the more I accuse myself and the more I have the right to judge you), his target the bourgeoisie!But his guilt pursues him bitterly, confession and redemption can not always offer forgiveness..In a cold, icy tone, written with great eloquence, Albert Camus strikes us with piercing words, criticizes selfish humanity, without forgetting, however, that he is well aware of being part of it."The fall" causes a disturbing discomfort in the reader and leads us to ask ourselves certain existential questions.To read or study at least by curiosity.
