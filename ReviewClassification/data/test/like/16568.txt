It's been years since I read Hex Hall for the first time and for some reason I got a strong feeling that I need to re-read this one. After six years.So, here I'm and this time in English.The main character is 16 which is a little younger than books I usually read right now. But honestly? I did not care at all! Sophie is so damn hilarious. I love that girl!(view spoiler)[But I need to take one star down for the instacrush/instalove.(hide spoiler)]I thankfully did not remember much about the book, except for the fact that I'm Team Archer! Yay! Nothing changed here.I was pleasantly surprised, how much I've laughed. Really liked this one.
