I saw the film of this book a few years ago. Gillian Andersonnever looked lovelier, but both she &amp; the film struggled to show me Lily Bart's motivations. I think the film should have started earlier than the book did, rather than from the point where Lily started to fall off the tightrope that was her careful trip through New York Society.I've always enjoyed (&amp; had a sneaking admiration for) the Society Adventuress characters, like Becky Sharp &amp; Amber fromForever AmberIn her circumstances, that is who Lilyshouldbe - but she is not. Even before the book's start she sabotages her own goals. I think she enjoys her own precarious freedom&amp; it is only when she reaches the age of 29 that she realises her beauty will fade &amp; it is time she snared a rich husband. She finds hervictimprospective husband, but any time her true love Lawrence Selden enters the picture she loses her grip on this goal &amp; this plus, her own naivety &amp; lack of killer instinct contribute to her downfall.I loved the beautiful language Wharton uses. I never once lost interest in Lily's plight, although I was frequently exasperated with her, I always understood her. She was a fallible human being &amp; that is a great part of this book's allure.
