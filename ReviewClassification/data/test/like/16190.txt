"No! Ashley! Put the book away!""But Mooooom! I'm at the part where he kills-""I don't care! It's two in the morning! Go to sleep!" She snatched the book one of Rangers Apprentice, The Ruins of Gorlan right out of my hands. She told me goodnight and slammed the door behind her.Snap. That's the third time this week she took it from me. I was at the good part too! Well, it's all good. The action, the adventure, the surprises. My favorite part, especially, when the boys got in a fight. Will and Horace. Brilliant!Will is a fifteen year old boy with no parents. He lives in the Ward with his friends: Alyss, Jennifer, George and Horace. Sadly, when you live in the Ward you are orphans and you basically take care of yourself. But Will's past is a mystery. He was found in a basket with a note saying only that his mother died giving birth and his father was a Hero.In this land, when you think or the word "Hero" you think of a knight and the only way to become a knight is battle school. Sadly, Will does not make it to battle school so he believes his life will be one of a farmer. Until, a Ranger comes and hold the key to his destiny in a piece of paper. Will finds the paper and sees that he is to become the one thing people happen to fear. A Ranger.Oh man, just thinking about the beginning made me excited! Remembering the dangers Will has to face like Wargals and Kalkaras who do nothing but the bidding of Moragrath, the bad guy. Then the suspense of wondering if a life is taken or if will can save Halt. The best part of it all though; you never know exactly what's going to happen next.It's full of action, adventure, and soon to be revealed mysteries.Yeah, if it sounds like your kind of fantasy book then read it! But, be sure you don't read it till two in the morning or your mom will take it away and, trust me, you won't want to put it down once you pick it up!
