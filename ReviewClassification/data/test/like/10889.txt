One of the things that I love the absolute best about Stephen King's books (most of them) is that they are immensely re-readable, and depending on where is in one's life, or how many of King's other books one has read, the experience could be completely different each time.I have loved this book for a long time. It's a quest, it's a great story with great characters, but more than that, it's almost like a prototype of where The Dark Tower series would eventually go... An alt universe mini microcosm of Roland's quest for the Tower.There's so much to love in this book - except Peter Straub's involvement anyway, which is something that I usually try to forget. It is no secret that I'm not a fan of Straub's writing. I've tried, and failed miserably, at reading two of his books now, and I've decided that his writing is just not for me. Whatever his involvement was in these books, Stephen King made it palatable to me. He blurred the lines and blended the edges so that it seems seamless and painless for me to read.Anyway. This read through I loved it just as much as the last time I read it, but I also felt like I had a better understanding of some of the characters. Jack has always been one of my favorite characters, but this time through, I felt much more empathy toward Richard. This poor kid has gotten the shit end of the stick from life. His father is a dick, he has no mother (took off? dead? Nobody knows. She's not even mentioned.), and his only protection from the insanity of the life his father imagines for him is to delude himself into complete, 10000000%, no exceptions Reality with a capital R. The poor kid doesn't even like fantasy books.Yet, he and Jack had very similar experiences. Both have fathers who could travel to the Territories, and both boys watched their fathers disappear and reappear in very different areas than where they left. The only difference is that while Jack's father left him and went to experience and learn from The Territories, Richard's father went to exploit it. And so their kids' individual experiences of the Territories they couldn't understand were miles apart in terms of experience, and it's all down to their fathers' ideas of what the Territories should be.He had fantasy related PTSD before he could even read. That's got to be traumatizing.I loved Richard's growth though. Even though he refuted and rejected every possibility of what was happening for 90% of his time in the story, the way that he eventually came to terms and acceptance was impressive. I don't know many 12 year olds who could create those kinds of life-changing coping mechanisms, and then break them down in a matter of days. So the fact that he started to forget what happened is either massively unfair to him, to work through everything for nothing, or incredibly just and compassionate. If you were to ask Richard, I think he'd choose the latter.I also felt slightly that Jack was a bit cruel and selfish this time through. His treatment of Wolf and Richard at times was thoughtless for their needs, and it really broke my heart at times. I get that in the greater scheme of the quest and its goals, sometimes one must do things that are cruel, and make hard decisions... But it was the little things, like Jack thinking that Wolf would enjoy a double-feature in a movie theater when he knows that loud noises scare him, and he's never even heard of a movie in his life. Can you imagine how terrifying that would be? Poor Wolf. It's just a small example of how twelve year olds just haven't developed their full sense of empathy yet.Speaking of Wolf... I really hated how he was read for the audio of this book. I loved, LOVED Frank Muller's reading for the first three Dark Tower books, but this one was just all wrong. Everything was so gruff and growly, and Wolf was even more so. It just had the complete wrong feel for me. I'm glad that I only listened to a little bit of the book on audio.Anyway - overall... love this book. Totally recommend it. It's awesome. Go read it. :D
