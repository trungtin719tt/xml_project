This book, the final of Ben Peller's "To Live" trilogy, did truly blow me away. It didn't quite seem to fit with the past "To Live" books, but this was probably on purpose. Shawn Michals morphs into yet another character, and leads a revolution on an unnamed island. The book reminded me a bit of "Lost," in that all the characters are dealing with their pasts in a present which holds mysteries that keep evolving. Good work, Ben Peller.Ben Peller
