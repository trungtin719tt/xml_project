You know that I am a mythology sucker. I love mythology! Every single time that I read about it or watch something with mythology I'm like:Besides,Egyptian mythology particularly fascinates me, so I could only love The Kane Chronicles! :)Though I must say that Carter really pissed me off sometimes. He still didn't grow on me like Percy did.I could immediately connect with Percy but with Carter that didn't happen. I didn't like when, in the beginning, he said that he was fine with being with his sister only twice a year.I mean, my sister isthe freaking devil's personificationa little bit difficult child but, still, I love her and I would be very sad if I could be with her only twice a year and we were pratically strangers to each other.I also didn't like when he thought that they had nothing in common and that Sadie never acted normal and that she was stupid. And I really hated when he thought that Sadie was the lucky one because she was left behind while he was travelling around the world with this freaking father! Yeah, it must be really difficult to be with the only parent you've left, constantly travelling, while your sister is in the other side of the world, feeling rejected and alone! :SI was really really like:But whatever, I prospered. I got through that. I like Carter but he has to make me forget this stuff.About Sadie - OMG, she's hilarious! I would love to have a 12 year-old sister like that! :)Like I said, I really connected with her. She was the one who suffered the most with everything that happened to her family. I mean, I wouldn't take it easy as well if my mother died and then my father and my elder brother left me alone. I feel so sorry for her. :(And I hope that she ends up with Anubis. +.+ I really loved Anubis! My reaction when I was reading about him was the same reaction Sadie had when she first saw him:
