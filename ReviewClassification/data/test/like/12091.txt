The heat in this disreputable part of the old town was oppressive and anything but sultry. All I wanted to do was shed the sweat-clinging skin of the day and stand under a freezing shower for about a week. If I followed that up with a few slugs of bourbon with some ice cold cubes swimming in them, well, that was nobody's business but mine.She wouldn't have it, though. She stared at me from where I'd discarded her on the beat up couch with a burning reprimand sizzling in her non-existent eyes. She was wearing a lurid red jacket that fit her perfectly. She was small but I could tell she contained multitudes.She held intense action, calculating sleuthing that owed more than a little to hunches and dumb luck than I'd have liked to admit and some tantalising passion that threatened to consume me within her papery arms.She'd finished telling me her tumultuous tale on the long, hot drive back from my office this evening. Her words entering me as close as any lover's whisper as the hot air pummelled me through the open car windows without offering a shred of relief.

Why can't these chippies just leave me in peace?I guess peace is too much to ask for a broken down, half-dead bum like me. I'd show her, though. She thought she'd left me trapped in a corner on a hot night with no choice but to give in and review... but I'd been around the block a few times and knew a few tricks myself. The secret was to move fast, before she fixed me with another freezing glance. I feinted right, and she glanced at my piece just as I'd hoped, while my south paw clicked on 'Save' and I hightailed it outta there like Beelzebub himself was on my ass...Buddy read with Sunshine Seaspray. Nowthere'sa gallon of trouble in a half-pint glass...
