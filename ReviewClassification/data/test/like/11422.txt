I AM SO CONFUSED RIGHT NOW.I hate it when people do that. Don't you just want to tell them," okay, calm down. It's not like writing in caps is going to get your point across any further." But I just had to, because my brain is bursting at the seams after readingThe Scorch Trials.I love Thomas' name! I know my enthusiasm is quite unnecessary, but I've never seen the name Thomas used for the protagonist of a book. And a great one, too. Now there are other references besides that darn Thomas the Train and Thomas Edison... boring.Anyway, this book was titillating. Sometimes I felt like Dashner was purposefully being a big tease by pulling the wool over Thomas' eyes one too many times, but I still loved it. There was something in the book about killing someone to get food... I don't think I would kill for the next book in the series, because then I'd be sent to the crazy place, but I still want it really really bad. REALLY, REALLY BAD. Now I'm doing it again...Now I can do my homework in peace. Hopefully. I'll probably surf the web for other people's thoughts on the ending instead...UntilThe Death Cure.Want to see my future reviews? Follow mehere.
