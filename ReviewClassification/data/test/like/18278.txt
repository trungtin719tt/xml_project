These books make me sad to know what kids are reading today. Very few "children's books" quote Euripides, Goethe, and include sayings in Portuguese or Welsh. These stories (A Swiftly Tilting Planet, which is my favorite, in particular) are largely responsible for the shaping of my imagination as far as time-travel, space, and the interplay between parts of history is concerned. And I always forget how beautifully anti-war they are. I also love how L'Engle weaves significant matters of faith into each story, and as a kid this definitely helped me understand that you didn't have to exclude God/faith from Fantasy/Sci-Fi. The only real complaint I have is that they all end rather abruptly, A Wrinkle in Time especially.
