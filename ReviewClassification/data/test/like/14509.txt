I decided to re-read this and annotate this, I haven't read it in years and it was pretty nostalgic to do so! L J Smith has such an easy writing style to get into and her characters are always super likeable.I missed simple books like these, they're all under 200 pages each, they're so easy to readdddd. I probably won't read the other 6 for a while, I always hate getting to book 9 and not having a book 10 to dive into.
