"This is the story of Ferdinand - a little bull who would rather sit and smell flowers than fight in the bullring."This book truly is a gem. While I had heard about this work before, this is the first time that I have read it and I absolutely love it. Originally published in 1936, this work has been translated into more than 60 languages and has rarely been out of print. As this title is well known, I want to talk about its background. Its a hefty one. While Munro Leaf is an American author because of the timing, setting and main character, this work is thought to have a political agenda. The book was published shortly before the Spanish Civil War. Described by some as subversive with a pacifist view (which challenged the facism that currenlty predominated Europe), "Ferdinand" was banned in many countries including Spain and Germany. Hitler is quoted as describing the book as "degenerate democratic propaganda". Franco was not a fan of the book either (the book was not available in Spain til after Franco's death). Its no surprise that the book was loved by Ghandi and Franklin &amp; Eleanor Roosevelt, among other important figures.When asked Munro denied any political ties saying "its a happy-ending book about being yourself". In fact, it is alleged that this work was written in 40 minutes on a whim to be give Robert Lawson an opportunity to illustrate. The illustrations are marvelous, by the way. Whatever your personal take away from the book, its impossible to deny its impact. Mine? I just adore this gentle and kind bull and love the message of the book. Its a sweet and charming work for people of all ages. This is my final book for 2017 and it was a good one.P.S.: I an really looking forward to watching the animated movie version.15/01/18 EDIT: Saw the movie this past weekend and absolutely loved it. While there was a story added, it kept the essence of the book. It is a perfect compliment to the original.
