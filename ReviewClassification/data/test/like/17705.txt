Upon Reread: I freaking love this book. Video reviewhttps://youtu.be/tM2iNM6JPAs--------------------------------------Brandon Sanderson is a jerk. Why would you rip me apart like that and then just... leave me there?????This book was amazing and had me guessing who the traitor was (I was wrong and like, what the heck?!?!?!) on every page. He confused me, shook me, broke my heart, and now I'm terrified for all my wonderful characters. Because Brandon S will go there - he'll just destroy them all.I can't WAIT to read book 3!
