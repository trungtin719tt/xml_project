Jon Scieszka has produced yet another unique twist on several well known traditional tales. In this cazy story, the author has combined many traditional tales such as The Gingerbread Man, Jack and the Beanstalk, The Little Red Hen, and Little Red Riding Hood just to name a few. Throughout the book, the author entwines all the different stories in an ingenious way.This book would be appropriate for older children who have a strong background in the telling or reading of a variety of Traditional Tales. This book also takes a child who understands text structure in order to properly follow the story. The story bounces back and forth and in between several stories at once.Spoiler Alert!"Once upon a time there was a mother duck and a father duck who had seven baby ducklings. Six of them were regular-looking ducklings. The seventh was a really ugly duckling."and so it goes on until..."Well, as it turned out, he was just a really ugly duckling. And he grew up to be just a really ugly duck."
