This story revolves around three characters, two of which I really liked and one not so much. I was thinking four star for much of the book, but the ending hit me in so many of the feels, a 5 star it is! I loved how the stories wove in and out and together.I feel like I was reading the Kingsolver I've missed in her later books, so many of which stuck me as a bit too preachy. This one hits the right note of environmental enlightenment softened by empathy for other views. Glad for reading this humid country summer read in the dead of winter.
