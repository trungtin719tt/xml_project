This is That Book.You know the one.The one you've daydreamed about.The one you hope, deep in your little reader heart, you'll finally find.The one with the plot that is both wide-ranging and intensely personal; with the characters who are all nuanced and flawed; with the complicated political intrigues to keep you guessing; with the shocking twists that are, true to form, both surprising and inevitable.You've slogged through the morass of uninspiring Twilight clones. You've suffered through dystopians trying to be the next Hunger Games. You've struggled to stay awake through overly lengthy fantasy novels written by people who have no idea what made Tolkein so successful, but think they can imitate him anyway.And here - here is a book that deserves every one of its nearly 600 pages. Here is a book with no superfluous sub-plots. Here is a book with no cardboard characters. Here is a series where people grow, change, and generally act like human beings. Here is the perfect mixing of philosophy, action, creativity, and heart.Ladies and gentlemen, I don't think I'll ever be able to fully express how in awe I am of this book.From this point on, this review will contain spoilers for the first of the series,Mistborn: The Final Empire.The story starts grimly. Yes, the Lord Ruler is dead, but that doesn't mean everything is fixed: his empire was a large one, and our heroes are only able to affect small parts of it at a time. Add to that the fact that they've lost their brilliant, charismatic leader and good friend, and it seems the situation is dire. Yet... they've learned something from Kelsier: they laugh in the face of danger. Take, for example, this exchange:Elend looked over at him. "The Assembly is a mess, a half-dozen warlords with superior armies are breathing down my neck, barely a month passes without someone sending assassins to kill me, and the woman I love is slowly driving me insane."Vin snorted at this last part."Oh, is that all?" Ham said. "See? It's not so bad after all. I mean, wecouldbe facing and immortal god and his all-powerful priests instead."They are still the witty, intelligent, compelling heroes we've always rooted for.Or are they?One of the several reasons I think this book is actuallybetterthan The Final Empire is that while that one focused primarily on Vin's character development and personal problems, this one expands upon the psyches of the entire cast. Part of the way it does this is through shifting the focus of the third-person limited point of view, so at some point the reader gets to see the thoughts of almost every character. (This is used really brilliantly; more about it later.) The other part is by showing Vin's understanding of others growing; as she develops more sensitivity, she has more insight into their characters. We see the soft heart beneath Clubs' tough exterior, the insecure young man that Spook has become despite his bravado, Ham's pain at being separated from his family, Breeze's devotion to the crew underneath his mercenary attitude.Most of all, we see the troubles of Vin, Elend, and Sazed.Vin has always been a complex girl. The abuse she suffered from her brother, Reen, made it so difficult for her to learn to trust, and even learning that Reen protected her with his last breath hasn't done much for her wary attitude. She still has the potent, niggling fear of abandonment in all of her relationships and so her emotional state is very, very fragile. One of the things I love about her is that she isn't a confident heroine leaking ambition and drive from her very pores. Indeed, her insecurities and doubts are some of what make her so easy to identify with. For a male author, Sanderson does an incredible job portraying what it's like to be a young woman - better, I think, than many female authors do. There is that tenuous balance between wanting to seem self-assured and wanting to be reassured which is highlighted beautifully in Vin's struggles in this book. Her doubts about her relationship with Elend could have seemed superficial, another New Moon-esque created crisis designed to show how much they luuuuuurve each other. Instead, they sprang from very reasonable places, and best of all...they weren't isolated. Like all the characters in this book, Vin interacts with her world, and so her insecurities come not just from the fact that she doesn't know her place in it but also from the fact that others think they do. Zane thinks she's a tool and an unwitting captive. The skaa think she's something close to a goddess, their holy protector. Ironically, Elend is one of the few people who doesn't seem to have any ideas about what Vin should be or is; he accepts her for herself, and that leaves a void in the pressure around her that she shies away from. She doesn't know what he wants from her, and so she projects what she thinks he wants.He loves me, but he's still a man,Vin thought.How many times have I hurt his pride by being Mistborn while he is simply a normal person? A lesser man would never have fallen in love with me.But, doesn't he deserve a woman that he feels he can protect? A woman who's more like... a woman?Vin pulled down in her chair again, seeking warmth within its plushness. However, it was Elend's study chair, where he read. Didn't he also deserve a woman who shared his interests, one who didn't find reading a chore? A woman with whom he could talk about his brilliant political theories?Haven't we all done this? Especially those of us who are writers as well as readers - you narrate in your head, and that includes imagining what other people are thinking about you. It feeds back into any lingering self-consciousness you may be feeling, and in Vin's case it makes her doubt herself.Elend is dealing with the same sort of problems and also with completely different ones. The Elend we knew in the last book was a young, bookish idealist, which was what made him so endearing. The first time he met Vin he complained about her stealing his reading light, for goodness sakes! He was completely adorkable. Readers like me, who have a thing for the nerdy boys, no doubt wanted to believe that his idealism and intelligence would serve him well in creating a utopia after the fall of the Lord Ruler, but that's not the case at all. The same things that were strengths in the first book, which set Elend apart from the rest of the corrupt nobility, are weaknesses here. He lacks social skills, self-confidence, assertiveness. He is not conniving or commanding. He believes so deeply in the innate goodness of people that it makes him blind to deceit and scheming. And while he is a very good legislator, he isn't really a leader.Yet.Elend's evolution from the young man who doesn't really know what to do with his role in life to responsible adult willing to make the hard choices and a few necessary sacrifices is one of the best parts of this book. This is where we really get into his character. When Elend is under pressure, he really shines: with a little help, he transforms into the king he needs to be just in time to have his kingdom pulled out from underneath him by various political forces. As a direct result, he becomes in a way just as insecure as Vin, and he too projects what he thinks she feels about him. These two are so similar at their cores that watching them dance carefully around each other is both beautiful and painful. Their relationship is not the most passionate thing ever penned, but it is sweet and strong, and they're a couple to root for. This is partly because Sanderson doesn't skimp on telling the readers what they admire and love about each other (are you taking notes, YAPNR authors?) and partly because of the irony, that two such intelligent people should be so clueless about themselves. That, too, is another part of being young, I think.Also, they're sensible about their feelings for one another. One line that made me want to cheer:And a kiss is supposed to make it all right?she thought sullenly, sitting back on a stack of books.Oh Vin, you are so fabulous. How many books have I read where a simple kiss can take the heroine's breath away and make her forget her troubles and all sorts of bullshit like that? Thank you, Brandon Sanderson, for writing about a couple who love each other but don't think what they have is the Be-All and End-All.(view spoiler)[Thank you also for the wedding scene, which was just short of being ridiculous but really seemed to suit Vin. Even if poor Elend was a little nonplussed.(hide spoiler)]And that brings me to the last of what I would consider the main characters: Sazed.Oh, Sazed. Poor, poor Sazed. You know, I honestly think he got put through the grinder worse than anyone else in this book. Like Elend, he is an idealist, though his idealism is centered more around the idea that people thirst for knowledge and less around political situations. And that idealism is brutally shattered as the book goes on. It starts out bad enough, as we join Sazed traveling skaa communities, trying to teach them about lost religions but confronted at every turn by scenes like this:"When is the Lord Ruler coming back?" asked a woman."I do not believe that he will," Sazed said."Why did he abandon us?""It is a time of change," Sazed said. "Perhaps it is also time to learn of other truths, other ways."The group of people shuffled quietly. Sazed sighed quietly; these people associated faith with the Steel Ministry and its obligators. Religion wasn't something that skaa worried about - save, perhaps, to avoid it when possible.The Keepers spent a thousand years gathering and memorizing the dying religions of the world,Sazed thought.Who would have thought that now - with the Lord Ruler gone - people wouldn't care enough to want what they'd lost?It is through Sazed's eyes that we see how the rest of the former Final Empire is faring, and it's not going so well. Because he is older and wiser than Vin and Elend, he perceives more, and there is a sense of desperation to his narrative that only grows over the course of the book. The final battle absolutely destroys him, but it is the epilogue that stands out most to me, because I cannot imagine seeing that scene - when belief completely collapses and horror and despair set in - through anyone's eyes but the man who wants to be a priest of all religions. It shakes the very foundations of the world, but it shakes the reader because of its effect on Sazed. I'm almost scared to see what happens to him as a result of that revelation.Remember the quotes from the logbook that headed every chapter of The Final Empire? There are quotes here, too, and they are definitely a highlight of the book. The journey of the Hero of Ages to the Well of Ascension is shrouded in mystery, and they cast a little more light on who he was and what happened in those last days. They also mirror some of the events of the climax in a way that heightens the tension to almost unbelievable levels. The resonance between the events of a thousand years previously and the events of the book is a powerful tool in the hands of a skilled writer, and Sanderson is definitely that.(view spoiler)[There is an incredible moment when I realized that the Lord Ruler was actually far more well-intentioned than he seemed, and I was almost sorry that he died because his character has more depth in retrospect than I had ever imagined. I love that Sanderson managed to humanize him not once but twice - the first time through Alendi's logbook, which seemed like it was his until the very end, and the second time in the moment that it becomes clear that he made his most important choice for the greater good. Sure, it didn't turn out so well, but he was a flawed human being after all, and by the end of this book he's almost cast in a better light than Vin. His flaws might have resulted in a thousand years of oppression for the skaa, but her flaws led her to release a force of evil on the world.(hide spoiler)]The shifting narration really served the scope of the story well. I particularly liked the sections from Breeze's point of view. Since he's a Soother, he has a good understanding of people and emotions, and the subtle way he manipulates situations to go the way he wants is very interesting. Also compelling is the loyalty he feels to the crew, which I hadn't really expected from him but which makes a lot of sense in hindsight. His viewpoint is the one Sanderson calls on when he needs to show emotions of someone other than the POV character, and it works beautifully. With other authors and other series, this might seem like stepping out of the form of third-person limited narration; here it's perfectly logical.A few other things I liked:Tindwyl, the Terriswoman Keeper who instructed Elend in how to behave like a king. She reminded me of a cross between McGonagall and Lord Wyldon (of Harry Potter and The Protector Of The Small, respectively) and I really enjoyed having her around. While her relationship with Elend was interesting, it was her relationship with Sazed that I was really invested in; it was a great insight into Sazed and into the society of the Keepers.(view spoiler)[I knew from the moment they admitted they loved each other that one of them - or both - was going to die. Damn authors. The good ones have that habit, I think, of making sure you adore the characters RIGHT BEFORE THEY KILL THEM OFF. Hiromu Arakawa, I AM LOOKING AT YOU.(hide spoiler)]Allrianne, who I at first disliked for her attitude and her Valley Girl way of speaking. (No, really. She literally says "Like, I saw my father's camp." FACEPALM.) No spoilers, but there's more to her than what we see on the surface, and I'm interested to see what she gets up to in the next book. Poor Breeze. He has no idea what he's gotten into.The interplay of numerous sub-plots was very graceful, even though some of them have yet to come to fruition. Also, though this book sort of has a cliffhanger, it also has a denouement. I'm not really sure how that worked, but it did.OreSeur, the kandra. Once Vin started being nice to him, their interactions were just... pure gold. No spoilers, but there was a Certain Scene that hit like a punch in the gut as a result.I'm iffy on Zane; he seemed a little forced at times, but in the end his role in the plot was decent. What really interests me was something revealed only near the end, which hopefully will be expanded upon in The Hero Of Ages.(view spoiler)[He mentioned a spike sticking out of his back, like the one placed in Steel Inquisitors. Was that the source of his false insanity? If so, does that explain Marsh's actions? And is it tied to the force from the Well?(hide spoiler)]Suffice it to say that this tidbit sent me off into a bout of theorizing. Whovians, there's about as much material here for pondering as there's been in Series 6 to date. The world of the Mistborn series is pretty damn complicated.To finish up, a couple good quotes:Personally, Vin didn't find the library's location nearly as amusing as its contents. Or, rather, lack thereof. Though the room was lined with shelves, nearly all of them showed signs of having been pillaged by Elend. The rows of books lay pocked by forlorn empty spots, their companions taken away one by one, as if Elend were a predator, slowly whittling down a herd.(Pg. 301)"Sazed, I've raised some fifteen daughters," Tindwyl said, entering the room. "Noteenage girl is stable. Some are just better at hiding it than others."(Pg. 426)Sanderson still has one writing habit that annoys me: he puts a comma after every 'but', even when it doesn't seem to suit the sentence. And of course there are places where the same word is used too quickly in succession. I'm not too bothered by that, though, because come on - the book is almost 600 pages long. It's not going to be linguistically flawless. That's fine. As long as it's still an engrossing read (check), one that makes me think a lot (check), full of surprises (check) and identifiable characters (check), I'm happy.This book, and this series:highly recommended. If you haven't read them yet, you owe it to yourself. Don't worry about the size; once you get into them, they go by fast - sometimes faster than you'd want them to.And finally... I don't think live-action techniques can do justice to it just yet, but Mistborn would make an absolutely mind-blowing anime. (Maybe it could go live-action in future. CG is getting pretty good, after all. But I think anime could get away with a lot more voice-over internal narration, which would be crucial.)
