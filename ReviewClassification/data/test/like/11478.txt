Someone commented earlier today on a book you had to read every Christmas. It made me think of this classic poem which I read every year as a child. I actually had the entire poem memorized as a young child because I'd read it so often from an illustrated children's edition. I feel the need to issue a word of caution. The Project Gutenberg edition was available for download and reading from my library; however, the formatting is awful. It misses letters and entire phrases. Fortunately I knew the missing words and phrases, but others probably don't. Please skip that edition!
