I can count on one hand the number of books that have made me cry. This is one of them. I chose this book because its cold here in Minnesota this time of year and I wanted to be whisked back to warm South Carolina, a state I've been privileged to live in. South Carolina gets into your blood and so does Conroy. He's simply a master of words, some of his descriptions so achingly beautiful that I had to reread them just to see if I had imagined them.This is a brutal book touching on the topics of the Holocaust and Vietnam with equal rawness. There were times when I had to put it down, the descriptions so harsh and real. But it was so necessary to go there.This should be required reading for all high schoolers. This novel will stick with me for a long time.
