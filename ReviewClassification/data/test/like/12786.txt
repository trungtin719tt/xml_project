Whyin the world did I re/read this right now!YES...THIS BOOK IS A HEART BREAKER :(Conor's mom is dying, he won't believe it. He says she's just having her treatments and she will get better like last time.I'm not really sure if the yew tree monster is in his mind to help him or if it's real. I like to think it is a little of both. It is there coming to Conor's window trying to get him to come out and talk to it.I really liked the graphics in this book, they are not not oh and ah, they are just graphics that tell a tale!Conor gets bullied at school, but this doesn't really seem to bother him. Maybe it dulls the pain of what's going on with his mom.Conor's dad comes back from the states to visit with him a little bit before..... Conor is living with his grandmother, whom he doesn't seem to like very well at first. Conor was hoping the yew tree monster would visit him at her house and he finally did... this caused a lot of destruction."I've been thinking it for the longest time," Connor said slowly, painfully, struggling to get the words out. "I've known forever she wasn't going to make it, almost from the beginning. She said she was getting better because that's what I wanted to hear. And I believed her. Except I didn't."No, the monster said.Connor swallowed, still struggling. "And I started to think how much I wanted it to be over. How much I wanted just to stop having to think about it. How I couldn't stand the waiting anymore. I couldn't stand how alone it made me feel."He really began to cry now, more than he thought he'd ever done, more even than when he found out his mum was ill.The yew monster tells stories to Conor, trying to teach him something until he gets to the last story and has to leave. I can't say any more, I don't want to give out any more major spoilers. I just know this book is so very good and it will break your little heart.It broke Conor's :(RECOMMEND TO EVERYONE!
