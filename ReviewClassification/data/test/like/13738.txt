I have been on a bit of a four-star roll recently and am beginning to fear that I accidentally pressed against my generous ratings button when I was slumped against the bookcase last week trying to figure out what to read next. It's cold and dreary outside and I was seeking something warm and fuzzy, maybe a bit light hearted or some sort of serial fantasy to see me through the onset of the winter months.... and then my hand brushed by the spine of Ethan Frome...Which is clearly none of the things I was looking for but I picked it up and read it anyway and so here we are. I actually managed to finish it in one day thanks to the relentlessly long commute to the office which was made even longer by the delay on the return leg when the train in front hit "something". To quote the train driver who made the announcement, "We are delayed due to a collision with an object on the track. At this stage we are hoping it is inanimate." I'm pretty sure most things are inanimate after being hit by a train but there we go.MISERYEthan Frome is a book about chance and misery. Specifically the chances that Ethan Frome had and the misery he subsequently endured because of them. You won't find much happiness here and the relationship between Ethan and his wife Zenobia "Zeena" Frome is a crispy and glacial as a winter in Starkfield , where the novella is set, although on the plus side this then makes the current temperatures here in Liverpool seem positively tropical. A loveless marriage to an ailing wife and back breaking work on a profitless few acres of farm land have transformed Ethan Frome into an old man at the age of 28. Wharton characterises him in such a way that you immediately imagine someone much older. Like Father Time.DOGS BOTTOMThe Frome fortunes change when Mattie arrives at the farm. Ethan's heart starts to defrost and that is when the trouble starts. Old Mrs Frome might be an ailing hypochondriac with a face as puckered as a dogs bottom, but she's got two eyes in her head and make no mistake about it. And what she sees is her husband developing an attachment to the hired help. From this point forward there is a swathe of eye lash fluttering, breathless outdoor encounters of the non coital kind and lots of blushing across the kitchen table or the milk pan or the barn door and wherever else country folks go to do their blushing. Of course you know it will all come to a sticky end so don't read on if the lover's final act is still unknown to you.DEATH BY SLEDNot for Ms Wharton the conventional drinking of poison, trapped and drowning beneath the ice on a frozen New England pond, or shot gun to the temple. You've got two lovers ready to make the ultimate leap together and a lot of snow. Snow plus suicide = sled, obviously. There has been much scoffing at the this method of delivering an untimely demise to the protagonist, and yes, I may be scoffing a tiny bit too. On the other hand I have been on this kind of sled and actually took one down the black ski run on a mountain in Austria once. One of the guys I was with planted his sled half way up a tree and broke his arm. The other guy went off a cliff. Not a massive cliff admittedly but big enough to probably ensure a little bit of wee came out. So death by sled is entirely probable, just more difficult to successfully engineer and a little more uncommon these days.LOVE THE ONE YOU'RE WITHIt turns out that death by sled really isn't easy at all and even seasoned sled driver Ethan fails to pull it off leaving Ethan, Mattie and Zeena locked together on the Frome farm each nursing their own ailments and bitter disfigurements as well as being the talk of the local town and, within the framework of the story, the subject of intrigue whenever a nosey newcomer arrives in town.If it sounds like I didn't enjoy this, then don't be fooled because I really did. Wonderfully written, beautiful descriptions of the Massachusetts landscape and all in one novella sized package. I've now downloaded the rest of the Wharton back catalogue so expect an onslaught of all things Edith soon.
