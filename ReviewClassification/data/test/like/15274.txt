This is somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, for me? Mayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyybe edging more towards 4? I'm quite perplexed as to how to rate it properly, I'm afraid.The writing style itself--taken on its own--would EASILY merit 5 stars, if not more. It was simply delicious. Light, and airy, and clear, and never confusing in the slightest. I loved it. I want to be able to write like this, someday:"The sun shone through a window, then made its delicate, fawn-footed way across the broad inlaid floor, and found the Beast's blue velvet shoulders to set on fire."I mean to say, Jeeves. That isexcellent. I'm most impressed.The story itself was very well-handled, too, until the end--and that's where it fell short of my expectations. Hence, me taking off 1 or 2 stars. Basically, I had been very much hoping this story would give some sort of explanation as to WHY it was "okay" for the Beast to imprison Beauty in his castle--you know, some sort of unavoidable necessity or whatnot--and it didn't. It just turned out to be the same, old, [slightly] lame excuse that I've already heard a million times:I need a girl to marry me to break the spell.Like . . . sir, that's YOUR problem?? That doesn't give you the right to trick a girl into coming to your castle and then guilt-trip her into staying because you "can't live without her"? Sure, he lets her go at the very end, but he's supremely reluctant to do it and makes her promise to return . . . and . . . I don't know, I just really wanted this story to bedifferent, somehow. Because it was so good in other respects, you know what I mean? I was disappointed.I was also disappointed in Beauty's story, at the very end :-/ Up until that point, I absolutely loved her: she was plain and stubborn and practical and slightly sarcastic, and such a delightful Kindred Spirit all around, it wasawesome. And then . . . what happens at the end of the story?(view spoiler)[SHE'S MAGICALLY CHANGED TO BE LESS PLAIN. And magically changed to be more comfortable in stupid ruffles-and-lace-and-silk, to boot. Do you understand how disappointing that is??? Here, at last, I FINALLY have a fairy-tale heroine whom I can genuinely relate to on a personal level . . . and poof, just like that, she's gone. Replaced with somebody totally different. I would have been completely happy to have her "accept" her own looks andthinkof herself as less plain; but that's not what the author chose to do. She literally changed the girl's whole appearance: something, I might add, that we real-life plain girls have absolutely no access to. Like . . . thanks a lot? Not?(hide spoiler)]So . . . yeah. I was quite upset by that.BUT I was genuinely delighted by all the references to classical learning included in the story. And I loved the magic library. That was special &lt;3I'm still perplexed about the proper rating. Because it was such a wild mixture of Stuff I Love and Stuff I Don't. I do recommend reading it, though, definitely--for the beautiful descriptions and pacing, at the very least :-)
