Alright. Before I say anything about the book, I have to tell you that I never saw the movie. Never. In fact, before my boyfriend lent me this book I was simply under the impression that this book is about a southern man who likes ping pong and thinks that life is like a box of chocolates. So, no comparisons to the movie here.To sum things up, this book follows the life of Forrest Gump, a lovable idiot with a few remarkable skills. A bunch of crazy stuff happens, including Forrest becoming a Vietnam war hero, going to space, being stranded on an island with cannibals, and a whole lot more. One of the best things about this novel is that every bizarre thing that happens to Forrest is actually explained in a somewhat believable manner, and every event connects seamlessly. The plot is (obviously) unrealistic, but that is one thing that is to be expected when you start reading this book.This was one of the funniest books I've ever read. The way Forrest reacts to his different situations is priceless, and a satire element is definitely present. My favorite thing about this book is that Winston Groom gives every character a unique voice, especially Forrest himself, which is probably one of the reasons that this book is so popular. It's difficult not to love the dumb oaf by the end of the book, so I know I have to pick up copies of the sequel and movie soon to get my Forrest fix.
