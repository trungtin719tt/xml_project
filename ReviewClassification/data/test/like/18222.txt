It has been a while since I've read a book by Nicholas Sparks and I have no idea why.However, I'm so happy that I dived back into his books due to this read-a-thon I joined recently. WHY? Because I just love to read and I love to read really good books. I mean, who doesn't?The Rescuewas so freaking good. It has such a good opening line that basically sucks you instantaneously. Now this book is about Taylor McAden and Denise Holden - and boy do I love these two people so freaking much. Taylor is a volunteer firefighter (HELLO GORGEOUS!) and he takes the biggest leap of his life: falling in love.Did you heart just pitter patter like mine? Of course it did.Besides Taylor, there's Denise who is a single mom who coincidentally doesn't have time for love in her life. Like at all. She's way too busy looking after her son, Kyle. However, fate has decided other things for their lives because the two meet after a terrible storm hits their town. Taylor freaking saves Denise after she was in a car accident. Waking up to his beautiful eyes. Ugh, I was jealous.I loved everything about these two humans, and I can't forget Kyle because I just adored him as well. However, I shipped the heck out of Taylor and Denise and I will continue throughout the rest of my life. Until my dying day. Seriously, I will.Overall, I loved this book so much that I can't wait to dive into my next sparks book.
