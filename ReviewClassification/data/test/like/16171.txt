6 April 2019After reading this for the second time my mind has completely changed about it.When I last read it I did not like it, I had many problems with it (you can read this below). Now, I completely disagree with everything I have said. Something made me change my mind about it but I can't pinpoint what that is.It is now one of my favourite books.30 March 20182.5 starsFor most of the time I was reading this novel I felt like nothing important happened. For almost the entire novel the same thing was occurring.I also found it to be predictable. I knew what was going to happen the more I got into the story.I did have to force myself, at certain times, to continue reading this. The chapters were extremely long, and would have like the chapters to be split up and make shorter.For the most part, the ending was enjoyable, even if I knew what was going to happen.
