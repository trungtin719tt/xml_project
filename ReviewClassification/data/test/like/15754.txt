Another Grisham legal thriller successfully concluded.This is definitely one of the author's most exciting and unusual books. I think, in part, because those who have never served on a jury always wonder what exactly goes on behind those closed doors. They will never find out, though, because most countries have laws protecting the deliberations from being made public. So, we will never know whether an irresponsible jury just flipped a coin for the verdict, or whether they decided they didn't like the defendant's lawyer's hair colour and punished him for it.In this book, all is revealed as we are taken behind the scenes and into the jury room in a "does smoking cause lung cancer?" case. The defendant, a large tobacco company is basically representingalltobacco companies who fear class action if the verdict goes against them. However, they don't need to worry as seasoned expert Fitch comes to the rescue with his pool of money and ability to operate outside the law.The jury is selected in a rush of activity as the experts scramble to analyse every detail of their lives. There's just one unknown, who's managed to slip through the net. He seems harmless enough, but the inability to find out anything about him is making both sides slightly anxious. Just who is Nicholas Easter and what are his intentions? And why are the jury behaving so strangely?This book keeps the reader guessing until the very last page. It has been masterfully created and intricately planned and executed. The characters are well developed and believable.Grisham often includes themes of absolute power corrupting absolutely and the ability to buy oneself out of any and every situation. The interesting twist this time is the ethical aspect--does the end justify the means? Is it okay to commit a crime or to blackmail someone if your intentions are honourable? What if they are also corrupt--do two wrongs cancel each other out and make a right? Are the people then both as bad as each other? The Bible tells us that we should do what is right even if it means standing alone and even if everyone else is doing something different. The way that we do things is just as important as the outcome--we cannot expect to achieve a good outcome if we act deceitfully in the process. We are ultimately accountable to God not people for the way that we live and conduct ourselves.Another bonus to this particular book is that the language is pretty clean, there are just a few border line curse words. There is no violence and there are just a few references to sexual activity that aren't graphic.For those who aren't sure whether they will enjoy John Grisham, this is a good place to start. One of my favourites, recommended.Check out my John Grisham Shelf!
