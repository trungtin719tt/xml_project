Dave's Quick Judgement -THE DEFENSE- Book is so cohesive, it feels like it was written by one author instead of two.- Horror and fantasy elements are blended together perfectly.- Story is astonishingly original and unpredictable.- Prose is lush and magical.- Events are very exciting (particularly the climax).THE PROSECUTION- Gruesome moments are not for more gentle readers(Of course, chances are gentle readers avoid any book with the words "STEPHEN KING" on the cover anyway!)- Plot inconsistencies can be frustrating at times.THE VERDICT"The Talisman" never ceased to amaze, surprise, or excite me! A truly breathtaking book!FULL REVIEW TO COME
