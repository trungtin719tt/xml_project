I feel like this is one of those books that a lot of people have heard of but haven't really read.Or.Maybe that's just me trying to make myself feel better about not reading it before lol.This book was weird-in a good way. It'sverydark and if you know me, you know I love dark books so there's that. BUT the love interest? I don't know, man. At first Valek is described as a man. In my mind Valek was automatically above 40 (I am very well aware of the fact that that is not the age criteria for a man but my mind works differently). And then Yelena is 19 so I thought Valek would be a weird nice uncle-ish and not the main guy. But I was, you know, wrong.Anyway, it was good. I liked it.
