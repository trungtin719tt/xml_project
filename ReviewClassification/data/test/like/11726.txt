When I first started this book, I wrote, "Kingsolver seduces the reader into the book with her lyrical and poetic writing.". If I'd only known how prophetic that was! This is a beautiful book to be read slowly and savored.The story takes place over one summer and tells three stories of love. The language and phrasing is so beautiful that I had to stop periodically and let what I had read sink in. It literally took my breath away in so many places.This is not a "beach read". You need time to absorb all the beauty that Kingsolver gives you.I feel privileged to have been able to read it. I'd recommend it to anyone who really loves to read and loves language used at its best!
