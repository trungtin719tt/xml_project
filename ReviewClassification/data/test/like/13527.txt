Trigger Warning: Sexual AssaultIt was very difficult for me to give this book a star rating. First off, I want to say that I enjoyed this story a lot and found it very enchanting. I didn't want to put it down and I will be continuing on with the series. I really enjoyed the writing and I thought the cast of characters was very intriguing and really pulled you in to the story. The novel did lull in a couple of places, but that didn't impact my enjoyment of the book. I did listen to the audio book which helps for the slower sections.I took off a star because I had some major problems from a feminist point of view. If you have read the book, I completely agree withthis postwhich CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS.
