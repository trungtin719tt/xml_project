I couldn't decide which translation to buy - the Penguin or the Oxford. So I bought both and read them simultaneously!!!What an idiot!!What an effort!!!What a delight !!What an education in the art of translation!!!No one told me this tragedy was going to be...funny!!Amusing!!Witty!!I still don't get it but boy! did I enjoy it.Novels in verse I have NEVER gone near.But I am MAD about Tchaikovsky's opera of this verse-novel. Now THAT is TRAGEDY!!I think poor old Tchai was a disaster waiting to happen ..so that's what he gives you. Great stuff. And those 3 ethereal ballets!!To die for!!But I stray.Pushkin is another Russian altogether. And thus so is HIS Onegin.It is truly wonderful. A masterpiece.Get it and relish before the End of the World, which I hear is just around the corner.November 1st, 2013. MORE REFLECTION:I had the opportunity to see a filmed Metropolitan version of "Eugene Onegin" yesterday with Anna Netrebko (Russian) as Tatiana and Mariusz Kwiecien (Polish) as Onegin.Only two of a fine cast. Tchaikovsky did not have to dig very deeply to summon up his tone of melancholy. It was a TOTAL indulgence and made me realise that for me OPERA is the pinnacle of the Arts when it can pull it off, which happily is often.It sent me back to Pushkin when I arrived home and again today.I particularly wanted to reread the letter scene where Tatiana writes to Onegin to tell him she has fallen in love with him, bravely, honestly and passionately baring her innermost soul to him.And his response also interested me.His response, which is really a very flattering rejection, is also honest and caring, warning her about being aware of the risk of being too open with strangers as she may get hurt. He admits that she is someone he loves but marriage would be a disaster for them because of him. Being like a brother is what he chooses.The librettist was true to the plot and the words of the poem.However there is not an ounce of Pushkin's humour.Which also works.There is no narrator as there is in the poem, which I think would overload the opera.I found I prefer the opera to the poem...but certainly appreciate them both. Pushkin's canvas is much broader than the opera could manage.Lucky to have these GREAT Russians...in music, poetry and song.AND a host of nationalities that helped to create this production !!!!If only the World could always beso happily and productively Multicultural!!!
