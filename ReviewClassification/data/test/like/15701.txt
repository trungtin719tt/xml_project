I love how everything tied in at the end - I'm usually good at guessing everything but I kept being shocked by this book. The characters' growth was enjoyable to watch, the magic system and the world building became more and more complex which I adored!I didn't 100% love the ending but I still loved this book.I can't wait to continue with the next ones!
