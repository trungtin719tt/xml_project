"Thick plots are my specialty. If you want a thinner kind, look elsewhere..." [119]Indeed one delves into an Atwood with the thought "What effect is she trying to convey" always, ALWAYS at the forefront of your mind. She is a master magician, &amp; one inevitably always needs to see the strings behind her "tricks."I must say that "The Blind Assassin" gave me the most comforting and treasured and magnificent shutting up that I could possibly deserve (essential lessons you learn all by your itty bitty self). The first 400+ pages of it, yes, I will admit, my early review would have read as such: "The interplay of attempts both conscious (the nebulousness of plot) and un- (surplus description) falls well below expectation." But I was dead wrong. You will remember--these are the musings of the main character in retrograde--she is an old woman*--her thoughts are akimbo. This book, my friends, is what that century-old "stick with it" rule applied to literature is all about. Even the writer herself knows that the anesthetic fog of it all must come to a halt--she has you exactly where she wants you--and knowing that the brave reader indeed braves on, she rewards him with the most elegant, the most perfect ending EVER! Eloquent beyond... Beyond.Why are haters haters? Because we are addicted to getting slapped in the face by genuine beauty.*SPOILER(?): this woman would totally be, in her advanced age, BFFs with "Atonement"'s Brionny Talis !!!!
