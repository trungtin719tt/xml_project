This was a fun second instalment in theNight Huntressseries. It was not quite as good asHalfway to the Grave, but I blame the lacklustre secondary characters for that rather than Cat and Bones.I was initially a bit horrified that Jeaniene Frost had chosen to kick this book off 4 years after the events at the end of the first book. I usually hate such time jumps, but in this case I think it actually worked out for the best. Cat had a chance to grow on her own and perfect her vampire slaying skills. She also got the chance to settle into her role as leader of a secret government vampire slaying squad. Best of all we did not have to suffer through her years separated from Bones!I'm still enjoying the mix of action, humor, and romance that this series has to offer.Rating: 4 stars.Audio Note: Tavia Gilbert did a great job with the audio. I've even gotten used to her voice for Bones.
