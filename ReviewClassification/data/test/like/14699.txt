I liked this about the same asOnyx. It had more romance, and an even sweeter and more dreamy Daemon, but less action. So it evens out in the end. The only action was the two escape attempts, which dont add up to many pages.But I really appreciate all the romance, and the focus on Katy and Daemon's bond. The reaffirmation of their relationship. We need that assurance that they can get through what faces them next. I am still a bit worried about their fate, but not sad. All the fuss over the ending had me worried, because I am really sensitive and I didnt want to cry. But I didnt. It ended up not being the kind of cliffhanger that makes me cry. It was a surprise twist, but not especially sad. But it really has me anxious to readOrigin.
