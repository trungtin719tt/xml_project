4.5 stars rounded up. I finally finished this freaking book!!! I initially started it on May 23, 2015!!! (I took a lot of breaks and started over twice)I am very surprised to say that this is my favorite installment of Outlander so far. I'm surprised because I really struggled with feeling engaged for the first 100 pages or so. (Hence why I started and stopped a few times.) What frustrates me and so many others about Gabaldon's work is that there is so much detail at times that it makes it difficult to persevere. I know her background is in research (and boy is that evident) and she is masterful at it (I learn a lot in reading these books), but sometimes I find myself saying, "Enough already!". I still think this book (all of them really) are too long, but DESPITE ALL OF THIS - I loved it.What had me concerned for this book in particular and what remains to be seen as the series continues is would the Roger/Bree relationship take precedence over Jamie/Claire? So far, it hasn't and for that I am thankful. #1 - I'm just so-so on Roger/Bree. I haven't connected with them as easily as I did with Jamie/Claire. #2 - Jamie/Claire are the foundation of these books and I'm glad to see they weren't relegated to lesser importance because they are older.I also enjoyed the dry humor and sarcasm that came out more with Jamie/Claire. This is the most time they have spent together since being reunited (and not always in a crisis either) so it was nice to see their relationship bloom. Can we also talk about Brianna and Lord John?? Honestly, I'm all for that pairing. I cannot wait to see this relationship on screen. Their dialogue was some of my favorite of the book.My last thoughts on this are that this book made me really feel so much more emotion - surprisingly more - than the last installments. There was such a payoff in this book for so many reasons - Ian, Brianna (and yes, even Roger). I will admit readily that I cried a lot at the end of the book. It may be that I'm older now and have gone through a lot of life events since I first started this series so things are touching me differently than they would have before - but this is why I was able to easily rate this above the other installments. The second book didn't resonate with me as much as watching the second season. So far, the second season of the show was a standout for me - but sticking to the books I really loved this one for all of its faults.
