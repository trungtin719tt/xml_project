This is an old, absolute classic, of science fiction from the days before sci-fi and fiction had separate shelves in the bookstores, it is almost the prototype of dystopian fiction. Re-reading it after many years I wonder if it was one of the books that helped fix in the public's mind the notion of 'mutually assured destruction' and of just how costly to the planet nuclear war must be.Despite the finality of the end, it is surprisingly not depressing, rather I found it a cleansing sort of ending and put it down with a sort of serious yet sad satisfaction.On the beach was published in 1957 and is set in the 'future' of the early 1960's just after a short and terminal war during which nuclear weapons were deployed extensively in the northern hemisphere. Now, our main characters in Australia wait fatalistically for the radioactive cloud to envelope Melbourne each dealing with the situation stoically but surprisingly consistently. The USA submarine captain, with no USA left alive to go to, the officer of the Australian navy who becomes his liaison and whose home is just a short train ride outside Melbourne has a wife and young baby. The CSIRO scientist who joins them for a couple of trips to determine the extent of the radioactivity and a young woman who's first coping method for the emergency is brandy. It is fascinating, well written and consistently eerie in a understated way.It is a constant surprise to me how extremely dated things written in the 50's are today, this novel is no exception. While the author lived in Australia and the novel is primarily set in Victoria it's 'feel' is firmly English,British commonwealth to the max in all things. The way people speak, dress and behave the fact that everyone smokes without question, the gendered social mores. Of course, in 1950's Australia was still very British, one forgets how much so and how recently.Many small things give the era away and there is a gripping fascination to realise that the end of the human race that is so unrelentingly unfolding never happened and that we went on. It is chilling to realise how easily, even then, we might not have had any future. Also, I found myself thinking of the chart showing how many nuclear explosions have been detonated on the world since the 1950's, and that was plain scary because there have probably been many more detonated since then, than the entirety of the bombs that existed in 1957. How is the planet doing, I kept wondering.As a modern reader I am accustomed to stories in which the hero always saves the day, surviving unsurvivable odds ect ect... Despite knowing that there is no survival in this one I found myself still half expecting that humanity will find an 'answer'. They do not, that is the whole point. So do not wait for our heroes to find a cure, this is a gripping, sad book about the end of hubris and these endings are graceful, brave, cautionary, they are many things but ultimately they are relentlessly final.
