Reviewing a John Grisham book? I know, I can't believe it either. But I've read this book about half a dozen times, and every time, it pulls me in.I've read an incredible number of John Grisham books. They're always very readable, but sometimes the story seems pretty stretched, or just not very compelling. This book doesn't have those problems. The plot focuses on a civil trial, involving the widow of a cancer patient that is suing a cigarette manufacturer. The twist is that one of the jurors is manipulating the rest of the jury, and apparently trying to get both sides to try to pay him to swing the trial their way. Lawyers on both teams seem to be willing to do just about anything to win the case -- especially since the stakes aren't just the potential high award of this case, but a whole slew of similar cases that would likely be filed if the plaintiff wins.Some minor plot points are a little bit unrealistic -- but they're close enough: there's usually enough of a justification that you can just continue on with the story if you don't think about it in too much detail. No problem.If you're looking to read a Grisham book, I suggest this one. If you're looking for an easy legal thriller -- fat enough to last for a good plane trip but easy to get through, with a story that's simple and easy-to-follow story but interesting enough to keep it moving -- this is a good one. It's not high literature, but it gets the job done.
