I've never seen the movie, but I had a general idea of what happened due to seeing certain scenes while my husband was watching.Shutter Island is the story of U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule who are sent to Shutter Island. Shutter Island is the place for the insane, who are a danger to others. The people here have committed horrible atrocities, and one of these people Rachel Solando has escaped. Rachel drowned her three children. As a story bears down on the island Teddy and Chuck must race to discover how this woman escaped a locked room, and what really is happening on Shutter Island.From beginning to end this book hooked me. It may have been a very different experience I believe had I seen the movie, but going into this completely blind made for an intriguing read through twists and turns. I knew it was quite a dark book, but I don't think I was prepared for how dark.I am definitely interested to see what else this author has written.
