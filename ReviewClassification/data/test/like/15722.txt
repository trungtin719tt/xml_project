Chosen for the specific challenge of reading a "book that's at least 100 years older than you", this surprised me in a good way.Part history lesson, part geography lesson - I enjoyed following the prim and proper Phileas Fogg, as he traipses across the globe to win an impossible gentlemen's wager. Add in a dogged detective determined to get his man by any means possible and a loyal, overzealous manservant, and you've got quite the zany adventure. Though they face obstacle after obstacle in the spirit of stiff British mannerisms, this was still fun, keeping my interest throughout. It even had a bit of romance to it as well!Truly, I really couldn't ask for more from a book as old as this ;)
