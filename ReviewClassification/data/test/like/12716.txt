This is going to be a relatively unorganized review because there is seriously so much going on in this book. Mixed feelings, complex ideas, great characters (although many hateable ones), and, frankly, it is screwed up.A book about cult followings with a cult following. To me, a cult following is a group of individuals who are passionately enamored with a work of art and culture, such as a book or show (i.e. The Binewski's Carnival, especially Arturo's philosophies). It is a relatively small but pretty obsessed group of fans. And the work of art, whatever form it takes, is typically loved or hated. It captures the heart of the selective individuals, and they cling onto it for dear life.Here is some great art by Katherine Dunn's fans, some of my favorites.I can definitely understand why Katherine Dunn's genius novel earned its cult status. Where do I place myself in regards to "Geek Love"? Somewhere in between. I would definitely not define myself to be one of the cult following, but I only hated certain aspects of it. I respect Dunn's work and was enamored by the story as I read it (between many moments of extreme frustration), and her talented creativity, imagination, storytelling, and characterization cannot be denied. She has a wonderful way with words; there are many memorable quotes in the novel. Although I did wish for a little more character depth on some of the characters, the character themselves were an accomplishment. (A great examination on this:http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php...)Sadly, I am unable to categorize this as an all time favorite book, as much as I wish I could. I really mean that, because I love the philosophy of this book. That we should all be ourselves, that weird is good. I have always believed this, am quite the blunt, unique girl myself as anyone who has ever met will tell you. So it means something when I started that Dunn simply crosses the line. At least her characters do.**** Spoilers ****Why not a five star rating? Like I said, this book is screwed up. Seriously, scarily screwed up. There are two interwoven plots and timelines. The back story tells of the Binewski's Fabulon, the traveling carnival run by Aloysius "Al" Binewski and his wife "Crystal" Lil. When the business begins to fail, the couple devise an idea to custom breed employees using various drugs and radioactive isotopes to alter the genes of their children (inspired by Aloysius's visit to a rose garden in Oregon). The results are Arturo ("Arty," also known as "Aqua Boy"), a boy with flippers for hands and feet; Electra ("Elly") and Iphigenia ("Iphy"), Siamese Twins, Olympia ("Oly"), an albino dwarf that is also hunchbacked, and Fortunato ("Chick"), the normal looking baby of the family who has telekinetic powers (who they were about to abandon because he was normal, when they found out they were actually their greatest "achievement"). Both this and the present day storyline (notated by the "Notes For Now" subtitle in the chapters) are narrated by Olympia ("Oly") who writes the family history for her daughter Miranda. Miranda is the daughter she created by convincing Fortunato to take Arturo's sperm from his behind his back. Arturo is furious when he finds out, and insists that she give Miranda away to a convent. In present day, Olympia uses her voice as a storyteller on the radio, has secretly supported Miranda in the same building she loves in with her mother. The three generations and only survivors of the Binewski's Fabulon following an epic fire.There are four main appalling ideas/characters/philosophies here. Parents who will throw away children because they are not "weird" enough to be profitable. Secondly, we have Arturo, the oldest son, who convinces hundreds (?) thousands (?) around the country to give up their lives to follow the Binewski's Fabulon, a traveling carnival, and a long process of removing their limbs and other body parts one at a time. Why? Because Arturo has nothing but flippers, and has somehow manipulated all his followers, the Admitted, to aspire to be like him; because only then will they feel beautiful and free from the pressures of society. Thirdly, in the interwoven storyline we have a Mary Lick, heiress of some great fortunes from a frozen dinner company in her family. What does she do with her fortune? She pays attractive women to get disfiguring operations, supposedly so that they may live up to their potential instead of becoming sex ornaments (it is obvious, however, that Lick's real motivation is at least in part to punish them for being more attractive than she is). Where she comes in is that she is trying to pay Miranda to remove her tail (the only weird part about her that Olympia insisted she keep against all the nuns' disapproval). Mary found Miranda in the strip club she dances at and has intensions to possibly "do more" with Miranda. This brings us to the fourth concern. Olympia's only solution, it seems, is to befriend Mary on false pretenses (gives her a fake identity), and then murder her. And die herself in the process. She seems to have actually planned on this, since she left a letter that was worded similarly to a will to her daughter Miranda in which she finally confesses she is her mother, tells her how she can support herself, and asks that she look after her grandmother. I actually dislike Olympia more for her ridiculous blind obedience to her brother than her murder. Seriously. At least this murder, although it seems like there would be another way, is from love. And not a Stockholm Syndrome incest love for someone who treats her like nothing. More on this later.Why not a five star rating? Back to the age old debate of whether we can truly love books with unlikeable protagonists; villains as heroes. I think that debate needs to be clarified with the difference between a villain that is well written and therefore becomes likeable (maybe not entirely, but enough) and a villain protagonist that may never become likeable but the author pens the story surrounding him/her so impressively that we love the book anyway. Personally, into the former category I place "Gone Girl" and "Lolita", "A Clockwork Orange" and "Psycho" into the latter. There are also shades of villainy. Serial killers are obviously higher up there and more objective villains than, say, Arturo in this novel.What was Arturo's cult? Well, Arturism defined:A quasi-religious cult making no representations of a god or gods, and having nothing to say about life after death. The cult represents itself as offering earthly sanctuary from the aggravations of life. Small chalked graffiti, said to be the work of the Admitted, are found in many locations after the Binewski carnival has passed through. Arturo persuades people to have their limbs amputated (so that they can be like him) in their search for the principle he calls PIP ("Peace, Isolation, Purity"). Each member moves up in stages, losing increasingly significant chunks of their body, starting with their toes and fingers. Many commercial posters distributed in advance of the show read, "Arturo knows, All Pain, All Shame, and the Remedy!" A fee, called a dowry, is required for entering the novice stage. The exact amount varies, but it averages $5,000 and is based on the novice's resources. The more the greedy Arturo can get, the more he will take.(This is all paraphrased and copied on parts from page 227, which details much more of the insanity.)A sub debate that I am more interested in is in regards to protagonists that are not villains, but are so annoying or does things that I disagree with do much that reading about them makes me frustrated and leads me to not liking the book. This is much more difficult to overcome than a villain, which good writing can remedy. An example is Olympia, our narrator. Why do I hate her so much? Because she loses everything to Arturo. Voluntarily. I might even hate her more than Arturo because, well, he is a villain. And easy to hate, when he tries to murder his family members, when he carelessly gets rid of anything and everything in his way, is openly selfish, and has his cult following anyways. Olympia, now, I want to like her. She seems to have a good heart and has done everything to raise her daughter Miranda right. Everything, that is, within Arturo's graces. In her words,Dear daughter, I won't try to call my feeling for Arty love. Call it focus. My focus on Art was an ailment, noncommunicable, and, even to me all these years later, incomprehensible. Now I despise myself. But even so I remember, in hot floods, the way he slept, still as death, with his face washed flat, stony as a carved tomb and exquisite. His weakness and his ravening bitter needs were terrible, and beautiful, and irresistible as an earthquake. He scalded or smothered anyone he needed, but his needing and the hurt that it caused me were the most life I ever had. Remember what a poor thing I have always been and forgive me.He saw no use for you and you interfered with his use of me. I sent you away to please him, to prove my dedication to him, and to prevent him from killing you...My job was to come back [from the convent] directly, with nothing leaking from beneath my dark glasses, to give Arty his rubdown and then paint him for the next show, nodding cheerfully all the while, never showing anything but attentive care for his muscular wonderfulness. Because he could have killed you. He could have cut off the money that schooled and fed you. He could have erased you so entirely that I never would have had those letters and report cards and photos, or your crayon pictures, or the chance to spy on you, and to love you secretly when everything else was gone.He could have done worse, but he chose not to.That last sentence makes me want to strangle her. What is this, Stockholm Syndrome?Ever since he was a young child, Arturo was a very envious, hateful, malicious, vengeful person. He tried to smother his little brother because he could tell he would be more successful than him with his telekinetic powers. And Olympia saw this, knew this, yet still doted on him and had some sorta incest love for him, culminating in her daughter. Who she subsequently sends away on his request.Conclusion? Both one and five stars, but I lean towards the five because I appreciate and respect Katherine Dunn's creativity and imagination. And, yes, we should all be proud to be ourselves. Be unique. Be weird. Be you. You are amazing the way you are.
