Rest In Peace Mr. Hawking, and Thank YouDuring my time with this text, I made a comment alongside the percentage update I have for books I'm reading on goodreads. I said it was a strange experience to be reading an important and well loved book, only to have the author pass away during the time of said reading. To add to this, I was actually given this book years ago by someone close, and I never made a full start on it until now. So it was as equally saddening as it was surreal when I woke up on the 14th March 2018 to hear Steven Hawking had died. I immediately looked at my copy ofA Brief History of Timeand settled on finishing it as soon as possible (it had been slow going until then).Although I intend to be honest about my experience with this title, I actually want to make a separate statement regarding whether the average persons decision making process should lean more toward the positive end of the spectrum when considering this book. Having just finshedA Brief History of Time, I personally believe it's everyone's duty to pick this text up, engage with it, and carry through with it until the last page.Coming from the position of a lay person with no background in Science (unless you include working on a fundraising team at the Institute of Cancer Research for two months. . . I personally think that's scraping the barrel) or Psychics, I found this hard to comprehended in places. In fact, the chapter on elementary particles murdered me. So much so, that my reading really slowed down toward the end of the book, even after learning of Mr. Hawkings death. Not only this, but just conceptualising some of the topics being explained was a nightmare for me at times. Believe me, you don't realise how much you rely on the above ability to carry you through a book, until you come across one that requires you to abandon said ability altogether and just 'role' with the topic at hand, knowing full well you're completley out of your imagination processing league.Yet, despite the above said, I simply cannot lessen my high level of recommendation toward this book. I wish I'd read it when I was younger, as it provides some of the most important foundations to understanding our universe, and, as Mr. Hawkings mentions in the final chapter, science moves so fast that it's next to impossible for the many uninitiated individuals such as myself to understand what's new. So having books like this that really try to make the basic foundations of these huge topics understandable is a gift.For that I am immensely grateful toward the author, and I look forward to presenting this to my child when they're old enough to being to grasp these concepts (I mean, It's not really like any of us really can, but I won't tell him/her that).On a side note, there are moments where the ideas broached upon in this book might mess with your head.Case and point: at times, I found myself staring deeply into my hand- followed by my book- on multiple occasions, trying to comprehend that whilst I was staring at two completely different objects, they were ultimatley made up of the same stuff (at the micro level of course). It caused some odd stares on the tube more than once. Especially whenever my eyes widened at the thought I might also be staring at a different dimension I'm simply unable to comprehend or see.Something I'm sure you'll inevitably do as well if you really drink the quantum kool aid.
