This is the third Jane Austen book I've read and it's by far my favorite. I love the story, love the heroines, love the MEN I just love everything about this. There was so much happening that it never felt slow or boring and the SUSPENSE and REVELATIONS at the end of the book were so fantastically done. AGH JUST SO GOOD.TIME TO GO WATCH THE MOVIE.Reread mid-Jan to early Feb 2016 for AustentatiousSTILL MY FAVORITE
