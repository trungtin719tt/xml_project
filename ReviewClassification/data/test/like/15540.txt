Holy heck on wheels, Vampire Bill managed to redeem himself! Who knew?!?I felt like this was very much an "in-between" book that could send the series in any number of directions in the future, but it was still very entertaining and well worth the read for anyone who loves the series.Since the book is so newly published, I'm reluctant to say anything more that might be too spoilerish so I'll leave it at this and strongly urge anyone who hasn't read it yet to do so as soon as possible!!! :)
