I really do like anthropomorphic fiction, probably set in place by that classicThe Wind in the Willowswhich I have read so many times I could probably quote it cover to cover. Ahem! So much for not liking Fantasy, huh? I enjoyed this though I was irritated by the animals 'mewing' etc instead of just speaking. I will read more of the series.
