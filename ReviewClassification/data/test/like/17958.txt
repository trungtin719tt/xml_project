So this book was a pleasant surprise! I left for New York and had only packed one book, thinking I wouldn't be able to read the entire book on my trip...oops. So I had to run to the bookstore to pick out another book to read. The bookstore closed in five minuets and I quickly grabbed the book because of it's interesting looking cover. Read the back, didn't sound too interesting, but noticed a quote from Terry Brooks which made me consider it. I picked it up and put it back down a couple of times, until the store said they were closed and I needed to hurry. I grabbed the book and thought what the heck, I'll give it a go. Read the first part, it was pretty good but not amazing. All of the sudden, out of nowhere, the book is insanely good and I am freaking out in the plane wanting to talk to someone about what's happening. I highly recommend this book and am happy I have found a new addicting series.First read 1/21/09Second read 12/4/12
