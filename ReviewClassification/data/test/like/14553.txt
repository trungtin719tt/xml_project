The epistolary meanderings of Helene Hanff and Frank Dole are insightful, playful in their coyness, and progressive in their development. This is an actual correspondence gone awfully right.There is a starkness of honesty in this correspondence. Yet the prose in the letters aren't quite as dry as might be feared. Like I said, the back and forth is progressive. There is definitely life in these letters.This real occurrence happens after the second world war(the last three words of which is a favorite book of mine). The books that are being requested by Helene are not the point of this book. It's just that there is a fictional value in these exchanges. These people lived. I enjoyed this little book immensely, hence the rating.
