As often happens, I feel rather inadequate when it comes to reviewing something so beautifully written and emotionally demanding.This is a retelling of a celtic myth, The Six Swans. A mix of folklore and fantasy, historical fiction and romance, Daughter of the Forest is the first of a trilogy (of 6 books, it seems). This book isn't fantasy in the way of most- it isn't filled with invented kingdoms or massive battles. It follows Sorcha, seventh daughter and only child of Lord Collum, as she suffers to rid her six brothers of a curse bestowed on them by the Lady Oonagh. Set in old Ireland and Britain, the story spans several years.I would recommend this book to anyone who loves folklore, fairies, historical romances, and more than a healthy dose of misery (this is the first book I've really cried over in a long time). Really though, it's impossible to describe how much this book charmed and enchanted, while completely devastating me.A new fantasy favourite.
