At a conference dinner some time in the mid-90s, I found myself sitting next to this extremely impressive Chinese woman researcher - bunch of frequently cited publications, well-read in three languages, manages to look gorgeous as well. I cast around for something to say."I liked thatWild Swansbook," I hazarded. "Do you know it?"She looked at me scornfully. "AnyChinese woman could have written that!" she replied. "There are a hundred million stories just like it."I must admit I had a little trouble believing her. But would Professor Fung have lied to me? That seems even less plausible.
