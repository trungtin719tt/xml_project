WHAT A FANTASTIC FINALE! WOW!I read Uglies at the beginning of this year and really enjoyed it.. later on I read Pretties and was really disappointed. It took me a while to get around to Specials, but boy am I glad I did because I enjoyed it so much!It had all of the action, emotion, moral dilemma, character development, and great story-telling as the first one!I won't say too much more since I'm planning a review video, but I was so happy with this finale to the trilogy! YAY!
