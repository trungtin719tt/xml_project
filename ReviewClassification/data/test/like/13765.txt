Don't understand all the bad reviews for this book. Sure, the movie is one of the greatest, but that doesn't mean you have to bash what it's based on. This is an entirely different experience than the movie. You can pick out the occasional event, but the movie is only a skeleton if the book's plot. Just a few small difference - Forrest never mentions leg braces, only plays one year of college football, goes on to be an astronaut, cohabitant of cannibal cotton-farmers, creature from the black lagoon, and a chess champion. Oh, and he plays harmonica better than the most soulful and lost prisoner. The movie really missed out on the whole idiot savant thing, and really just dumbed the character down into just a straight up IDIOT with a big heart and strong legs. The famous cross-country run that takes up a large part of the movie never even occurs in the book. Most everything else does, but it's best to just take both of them in and enjoy them separately, because they're almost different stories. It's a funny and extremely entertaining book the whole way through. Well worth the read.
