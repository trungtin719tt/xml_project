Okay...so let's see if I can form coherent thoughts!I was not instantly swept away byThe Edge of Never. In fact, I kept thinking, "Where is this amazing book everyone keeps raving about?" Maybe everyone's on drugs and I didn't getting any? Maybe I bought the wrong book? Maybe I'm just a cold hearted bitch that's too tough of a critic? I was bored and totally disconnected from the story. I was just trying to get through it, struggling to get through it. I had my two-stars all polished up and ready to go.WHERE THE HELL IS ALL THE AWESOME!About halfway through (48% to be exact), the book jumped up and yelled, "Here I am!", doing such a 180 that it made my head spin! Did he really say...did he just...did she..what...huh...what the hell?! Am I reading the same book?This is where I started to feel like a thirteen year old girl in sex ed who can't bring herself to say the word S-E-X. I giggled, I blushed, I slapped my hand over my mouth so hard I got whip-lash! What they did! What theysaid! This is when my highlighter came out and I started typing like a maniac! Everything from this point on shocked the hell out of me. It was the shock factor that finally won me over. It came out of nowhere ineverysense of the word.I spent the whole second half waiting for the bottom to drop out. I finished the last page not being able to think about anything, but Andrew and Camryn. I tried to watch TV...Andrew and Camryn. I tried to read another book...Andrew and Camryn. I finally had to go to sleep thinking about nothing, but Andrew and Camryn.This book baffled me. I absolutely did not like the first half, but somehow, someway I was infected and the story completely got under my skin; taking on a new direction that shocked me into submission. The beginning...the end. They were two halves of a completely different coin. I definitely feel like I had to pay a price to get to the end. However, at the end of the day...I'd pay that price again.
