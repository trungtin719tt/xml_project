Book Trailer:http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=...This book amazed the funny right out of me, but replaced it with something more. So much more that I can't even curse properly! It was so well written it hurt. By the end I was bled completely dry of all thought...all emotion!I was so incredibly close to just repeating, "OH MY GOD, WOW! OH MY GOD, WOW! GET ME A DRINK! OH MY GOD, WOW!", over and over again for this review, but it's important for me to let you know exactly how this book made me feel. How it affected me. How it became part of me.At first I thought it started off slow, but I'm convinced now that this was for my own good. I needed to put my baby toe in the water first. I don't think I could have survived being thrown in. I needed that time. Please...PLEASE don't give up on this book. You have to trust me that it's all part of the journey, part of the experience.There were times where I felt physically ill. I wanted to throw up. Maybe I did. In my mouth. Just a little bit. There was even a point where I wondered why my kindle kept moving. I realized that it was my shaking hands, my pounding heart and my heaving chest that kept causing my kindle to have a seizure!You're probably asking yourself how could someone possibly get so emotional about a book. Easy. At some point between the soulful dialogue and raw emotion...this book became real. The words defined romance and the characters touched my heart.There was something about the emotion of this book that was almost cleansing. I felt, I broke, but I healed!The Sea of Tranquilityreminded me that books aren'tjustentertaining; they're more than that.Thiswas more than that. It caused me to feel, invaded my thoughts, my heart...it became a part of me. READ ON!
