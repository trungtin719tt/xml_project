Prior to November 2003, non-fiction only entered my reading choices on sporadic occasions. In November 2003, a pioneering member of my book club was the first to choose a non-fiction book instead of a novel. That book was Seabiscuit.Even though I have always loved horses, I had avoided reading Seabiscuit. I just couldn't believe that all the hype was real. So many times I had picked up a non-fiction book on a topic that I was really curious about, and either put it down unfinished or forced myself to slog through it. Despite my interest in the subject matter, the writing would drive me crazy - too technical, too boring, too text-book like. In fact, as one of those over-achieving students who always completed college reading assignments, I would have to say that many textbooks were actually better reads than the average non-fiction offering on store shelves.Seabiscuit, I was happy to find, was a complete surprise. The hype was real. No wonder it had sold so many copies. It really does read like a novel, and yet it is so deep - Ms. Hillenbrand has really explored her topic thoroughly and passes on all the details to us. There is a section where she describes the jockeys' experience of riding in a race that is one of the best pieces of prose I have ever, and will ever, read. I read it over and over. It's so visceral, she really puts you in the saddle, plus the prose is beautiful in and of itself. Another reason for the success of this novel is her success at placing the events in their historical context. She not only puts you in the saddle, she takes you back in time.This was one of the universally best-received choices we've read in book club. Everyone loved it, whether or not they cared at all about horses or sports. And ever since then, I've given non-fiction more chances, and with better luck, than ever before. Sometimes I still put one down unfinished, but now that I know how they can be, I try more often.I highly recommend Seabiscuit to any of the following people:anyone who has the slightest interest in horses or sports,anyone who thinks jockeys have an easy job,anyone interested in American history,anyone with no interest in horses who just loves good writing,anyone who thinks non-fiction is dull and would welcome a surprise,and EVERYONE ELSE! :o)==========================Update, 2011Just finished reading for the second time, this time aloud. Still LOVE this book. And while reading aloud (which really makes you take your time!) I was powerfully struck again by the Ms. Hillenbrand's facility with language - to say she has "a way with words" is entirely inadequate to express the beauty and expressiveness of her writing. But although beautiful, please don't think her writing might be too "prosy" - it is NOT unnecessarily flowery or overbearing. Seabiscuit is simply a fabulous read.
