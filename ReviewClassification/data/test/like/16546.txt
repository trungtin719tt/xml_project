Billy Blake Who Made Thee?Poet Poet, burning bright,In the stanzas of the night;What romantic coquetry,Could frame thy fearful poetry?In what distant when or whys,roll'd the epic of thine eyes?On wet verse dare he aspire?What poet'shand, robs Shelly's pyre?And what meter, &amp; what art,Could twist the cadence of thy heart?And when thy heart began to beat,What dread iambs? &amp; what dread feet?What the motif? what the type,In what belly was thy gripe?What the image? what simile,Dare its deadly metaphors be!When all critics threw down their pensAnd water'd heaven twixt now and then:Did Marx his smile his classes see?Did he who made cultural criticism make thee?Poet Poet, burning bright,In the stanzas of the night;What romantic coquetry,Could frame thy fearful poetry?
