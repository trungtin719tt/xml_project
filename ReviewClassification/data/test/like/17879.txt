This book is hilarious.The Auditors have decided that they need to "remove" the Hog Father...so they contact the Assassin's guild and Mr. Teatime (pronounce it "Teh-ah-tim-eh." ) is sent to "inhum" him (but Hog Father isn't human). As you can imagine chaos ensues. With Death taking over the Hog Father's role to keep belief in him alive, while Mr. Teatime (pronounce it "Teh-ah-tim-eh.") and Susan (Deaths grand daughter) are in the realm of the tooth fairy...Teatime trying to use what's there to assassinate the Hog Father and Susan trying to stop him, while Death is taking children's Hog Watch wishes very literally..... While all this is going on we haven't even talked about the wizards and......well you get the idea.Pratchett at his best (and that's saying something). Read this ....or the Verruca Gnome might show up.... think about it.
