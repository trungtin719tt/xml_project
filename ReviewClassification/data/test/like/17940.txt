This book blew my mind....literally. From it's motley crew of colorful characters to the mind-bending plot, for a science fiction novel that takes place in the brain this book has a lot of heart. I laughed, gasped and cried at different parts. First of all I really related to Bernard and his lack of impulse control as well as his frustration with Ms. Needleman (I always had so many questions in science class and they weren't always answered, much to my chagrin), but also Barnard has a wonderful imagination and curiosity about his predicament and I really loved that about him. I also fell head over heels for Frobenius (he's so adorable) and Adhista (she's so cool, and I loved Nesus, the neorosub), and Basilides as well. This book is a perfect blend of science, fiction, action and adventure and I would highly recommend it to everyone, whether they love science fiction or not...I would like to thank @brainwalkerfans on Instagram for e-mailing me a complementary ebook in exchange for an honest review.
