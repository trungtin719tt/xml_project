I will certainly call it Hardy's Masterpiece as he designed it in a way that it posed a serious challenge to the society at that time. Later, though, denied the due for his artistic intelligence, the author had to shun the writing (many believe so). Jude, whatever be said by whoever, is a character who is sincere and honest and brave enough to accept what is thrown at him as a challenge, could not defeat the society and today, we have overcome that. When Shakespeare said that love knows no bound and east can overturn itself into the direction where Juliet be, why deny Jude his Sue!I loved reading this novel and I liked the idea of getting out of the Hardian shelf and writing something unHardy.
