I feel like I'm broken in 10 different places. It's over. It really is over. Roland Deschain of Gilead has finally completed his quest to reach The Dark Tower - none for the better, none for the worse.There were so much losses, heartbreaks, and blood. SO MUCH BLOOD WAS SHED. And I have suffered through every....damn..... bit .... of......it. Cried my way through too.When I've patched up all 10 broken pieces of myself, I'll be doing a super lengthy review of the entire Dark Tower series. It really is a truemagnum opus. And dare I say it? This is the best series I've ever read in my short life so far. First to Harry Potter even. (and I thought no other series could top The Harry Potter series).Say sorry, sai-Rowling.
