My grandmother's favorite book of all time, so I have always wanted to read it. This is such a great book. It nearly ripped my heart out for making me think of my Grandmother. It is about a 14 year old boy in 1906 Cold Sassy, Georgia. The book centers on Will Tweedy's relationship with his grandfather and the small town scandal that begins when his grandfather remarries a young woman two weeks after his wife's passing. The narrative is so witty and touching and it is written in such a strong southern dialect that I found myself thing in terms of "dern it" and "I reckon"! I cried for the last 50 pages and wanted my Grandmother to be here to hug me and tell me she loved me at the end.
