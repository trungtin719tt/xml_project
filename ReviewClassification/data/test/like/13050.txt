The physical book is beautiful and it will be a joy to share it with the grandchildren once they get older.I have never read this story and found it quite delightful. I was suprised that Mary Poppins came off quite firm with the children, I thought she would have been more fun like. The children were good so I wondered why they needed Mary P, but I think it was just to bring a bit of magic into their lives.
