I guess 9th times the charms because I loved this book way more than I ever had. I think in my adolescence, I spent a lot of my time comparingCity of Ashesto other books in the series. This reread, I viewed this story as an individual entity, which allowed me to better appreciate the complexities and conflicts that arise in this sequel. I had such a fabulous time rereading book two and cannot wait to continue rereading the rest of the series!
