Another of those books which take no time to read but are an absolute joy every time you revisit them. The story of a flamboyant, generous, intelligent american woman and her friendship with a seemingly much quieter but equally generous and humourous english bookseller. Their mutual love of literature and all things book is the initial leaping off point but their friendship extends over 20 years and covers momentous changes, in british society certainly. These changes are hinted at gently, referred to in passing but over it all extends this decent, kindly, generous pair of hands joined at the bookshelves as it were though, somewhat sadly, they never actually get to meet.Having said that I have often wondered, in reading the book, whether i am pleased they never met, so that their friendship remained intriguingly long distance or whether i am saddened by the missed opportunities for it to go deeper. I am not one of the readers who think they were in love with each other. Nothing in the letters suggests that to me. Theirs was a friendship pure and simple but it is interesting to think that this book would never exist nowadays because telephone, email, skype and all things 21st Century would have prevented the gentle deepening of their relationship.The gradual softening and opening out is lovely to follow but the immediacy of 21st Century communication would, I think, rather ironically have prevented this burgeoning because the whole narrative through the letters is of Frank Doel slowly becoming more relaxed and in tune with the more abrasive approach of Helene Hanff. This would not happen now. Judgements would be made quickly and decisively, carved into stone and no amount of drip, drip, drip would change them. The slow back and forth of letter and request and invoice in the now long lost bookish atmosphere of the late 40's and 50's served to gradually dig out the foundations upon which they built their lovely, eccentric and, for any booklover, immediately recognizable friendship.
