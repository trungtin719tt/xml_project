Confession:I started this book over ten years ago. I had three short stories to read to finish it and I completely forgot about it. Today, I completed these short stories, and as a result, I have conquered the book I loved as a child.This is the perfect introductory book for anyone who wants to know more about Roman, Greek or Norse mythology. Hamilton shares various stories in a very simple, and yet, entertaining way. For me, there's a lot of nostalgia connected with this book. I was gifted it, and I fell in love with it instantly. I chose to read one story a day, using games with my brother to decide what story I would like to read next.Like I said before, it's a fun introductory read into mythology, where we learn a different version of how Hercules came to be... Among other stories.
