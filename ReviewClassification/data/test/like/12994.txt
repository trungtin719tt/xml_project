Toni Morrison is one of my favorite authors. I discovered her writing withBelovedfor which have a copy signed by her at a reading in Brooklyn ofJazzdecades ago. InThe Bluest Eye, she looks at the intersection of racism, self-hatred, poverty, and sexuality with realism and her beautifully descriptive writing style."By the time winter had stiffened itself into a hateful knot that nothing could loosen, something did loosen it, or rather someone. A someone who splintered the knot into silver threads that tangled us, netted us, made us long for the dull chafe of the precious boredom."It should probably be considered post-modern in the sense that the narration moves from character to character and it is up to the reader to intuit the speaker and the time at which the action is happening.True love as represented by the blue eyes and blond hair seen in the movies frequented by Frieda and Claudia as well as Pauline and most of all, Pecola, is as inaccessible as their parents' understanding leading them to either steel themselves against feeling like their mothers have or go insane:Pauline:"It would be for her the well-spring from which she would draw the most destructive emotions, deceiving the lover and seeking to imprison the beloved, curtailing freedom in every way."As Wright and Ellison had described as well, life in the North was not a safehaven free from racism. Cholly was just as invisible in Ohio as he would have been in Mobile. The White ticket counter is still forbidden him when he buys his ticket to see his father. His Aunt and the women that raised him"ran the house of white people, and knew it. When white men beat their men, they cleaned up the blood and went home to receive abuse from the victim."The cycle of violence feeds on itself leading to tragic consequences for each of the characters.In today's amerikkka of immigration quotas, race-baiting, and continued white police-on-black violence,The Bluest Eyestill remains as relevant today as when Toni Morrison published it in 1993, the year she was justly awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature. It really is a must read.
