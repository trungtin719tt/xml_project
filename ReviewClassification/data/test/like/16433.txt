Ugly Love by Colleen HooverQueen Hoover has done it again with this masterpieceActual Rating:is more in-between 4 and 5 than just 4.From the moment I opened this book I was already immersed in the story and completely invested in the characters.Colleen writes such incredible characters, and these ones were right up there with Slammed for me.Tate and Miles were such amazing, well thought out characters that I just loved so much... Cap was a great mood lifter too :')The chapters from Miles's point of view were so enjoyableand emotionally painfulto read, and were a really, really great edition to the story, that made it that much more in-depth. Miles's whole back story was so interesting and heart wrenching to read about.The ending was beautiful, and I loved how everything panned out in the end.I loved this book so, so much and it is now definitely one of my favourite Colleen books. If you're really mature, or over 16, please go read this!how many times have I said the word 'loved'P.S: I really hope the movie does the book justice...
