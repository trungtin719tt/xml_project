Steeped as it is in such uplifting topics as childhood sex abuse; repressed pedophilic desire; betrayal; broken friendships; broken people; doomed love; the pain of loss; brutal, senseless murder; the stifling nature of the stoic, emotionally-contained masculine ideal; and tragically misguided attempts at retribution and revenge,Mystic Riveris an enjoyable and deeply satisfying read. Dennis Lehane paints a vivid, beautifully romantic-yet-depressing portrait of various lives in an economically depressed (fictitious) Boston neighborhood on the cusp of gentrification. Lehane's just a terrific, pretense-free writer. His descriptions and dialogue are graceful and memorable and his characters -- the primary and peripheral -- are as nuanced and developed as can be expected in a 400 page novel that seeks to describe so many.My only regret is having seen the movie first. For me, it's actually a toss up as to which is better (heresy, I know). Despite written physical descriptions to the contrary, I steadfastly maintained mental images of the characters as they appeared in the movie because they were, you know,better(Sean Penn as ablond?I don't think so). At other times, the written dialogue failed to resonate the way the edited spoken dialogue had. On the flip side, the novel's third person narrative allowed for a much greater development of characters' inner experiences and as a result, certain motivations were much clearer and significantly more disturbing.
