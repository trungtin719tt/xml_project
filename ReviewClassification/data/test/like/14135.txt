this was a re-read for me.my original review can be found here:goodreads:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...youtube:https://youtu.be/kKQ5jusa8foAfter re-reading this, I stand by my original 4 star rating and my overall enjoyment of this book. I want to make it clear that I know this book does not have the most original concept and it also uses a lot of tropes, but I still had such a fun time reading it. I love the characters and the shock factor and the world. I can't wait to give Glass Sword a go and see where Victoria Aveyard takes this story.
