This is one of the darkest post-apocalyptic books I've read in a while... totally satisfied that craving.I may have had a few bad dreams about it!What I would have liked knowing beforehand:- Nuclear war with Russia- There are fantasy elements in here- Yes, it's long...- There's a war going on so if you're not really into military fiction... won't be for you!- Overall it was almost too realistic...- Did I say it was really dark?I would recommend it!
