The writing is simple and very well paced. I had a hard time putting this book down.I did have a little gripe with this book, What happened to Ever? I was a big fan of hers until now. Not to give anything away but the ending came out of nowhere. Ever starts out not trusting Roman, even though everyone has fallen for him. She has strong feelings of distrust for him and follows her gut by keeping her distance. She is outwardly rude to him through out the entire story. Then comes the end ... she does a 180 and trusts him whole heartedly. Out of nowhere?I've got no problems with cliff hangers, but it was so out of character for Ever to trust Roman that I had a hard time believing it. I really really disliked the ending.Would I recommend it? Yes! But you'll need to read Evermore (1st in the Immortal series) before starting Blue Moon.
