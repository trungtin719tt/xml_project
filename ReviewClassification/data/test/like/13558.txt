My paperback copy has post it notes stuck on pages where I loved a quote, an idea, a tie in to something else, and just a part of the story I enjoyed. Fitzgerald crafts a sentence that just explodes with emotion and thought. I enjoyed this one immensely. So much that I splurged on a copy of Matthew Broccoli's work on the composition of this book- which is amazing judging from my brief sifting through it.I plan to update this review a bit more once I learn more on this book's background.
