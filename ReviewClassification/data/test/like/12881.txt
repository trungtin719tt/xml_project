Well well well... 3,7/5 stars for me...If I get to tell you my feelings about this book in one single word, it would be"FINALLY!"To be honest, having watched the movie, this book did not surprise me at all and all I can say about this one is how true to life and down-to-earth it is. The characters are alright, however, I personally "slightly" hate the leading male character Dexter who is, needlessly to say, arrogant, cocky and (ahem!)a pain in da ARSE!There I said it!Seriously this takes meWAYtoo long to finish as you can probably see, and there are several times when I have to fight against my will not to leave this one in the DNF section ( how cruel and guilty I shall feel for having done such a thing to a book! )Overall, I would recommend this to people who would love to spare quite some of their times for such a novel, and WARNING:Do not watch the movie before you read it, totally ruins the hype!!You've been warned mate :P
