Life in the western territories was rough, and uncertain. And it was in this environment that Miss Sarah Prine carved out a life for herself and subsequently her family. Sharp of mind(and tongue) with a thirst for knowledge almost unheard of in that part of the country,Sarah determined early on that she would do what it took to survive and thrive. And thrive she did!In a no-nonsense manner she records her life in her journal. The reader is with her as she does her daily chores, squabbles with her family and faces down a myriad number of crises. And there is a front row seat when she spurns the unwanted attention of a certain dashing soldier time and again. Exasperation sets in,as she does her level best to make him understand that she just isn't interested, only to desperately miss his presence when he leaves.I had to remind myself more than once that this was a work of fiction, not an autobiography. It reads as truth. The author did her homework with research for sure. I loved this look at life through Sarah's eyes and pen. People and events weren't all tied up with a pretty ribbon. It left me with that feeling of truly having just finished her journal, not a book.
