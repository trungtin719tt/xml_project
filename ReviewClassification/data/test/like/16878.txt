This was my second book by Sarah Dessen and it didn't disappoint. In this story we meet:~Ruby who is trying to find, and come to terms with a new life away from her 'loving' but negligent mother. Only having ever been told one side of the story by a woman embittered by her feelings for Rubys father, Rubys view on life and living has been tainted.Nate, (Rubys next door neighbour) who's a great guy who seems to have it all but does he? Ruby soon finds out things she doesn't want to know and whilst she's still coming to terms with her own adjustments to those around her she finds it difficult to offer the right kind of help for him.Cora (Rubys sister) who is trying to make sense of problems within her own life whilst having to build the bridges that were severed when she moved away from Ruby and her mom.andJamie (Coras husband) who pulls everyone together with his enigmatic personality and warm nature, and whilst Ruby sorely tests his patience he remains a positive force for her.I loved this story, I especially liked the way Dessen incorporates Rubys two 'lives' and how Ruby interprets and evaluates her own actions. Ruby is a lovely intelligent character but I don't know how this story would've worked had she been arrogant and angry, maybe it wouldn't have hence the story of a girl who faced with choices makes mistakes but ultimately knows the right path to follow.
