I first read this book in my first year of high school for a book report (we could choose ANY book we want, and I was obsessed with the film version of this novel at the time). Since it's been...well, years...it's about time I finally give this book a review to add it to my collection!This book was super popular and a sequel has come out (which is currently sitting on my to-read shelves waiting for me to dig into it) in recent years. For those who don't know about the first book in this series, we are following Andrea (or Andy) who gets a job at a famous, fashion magazine (similar to Vogue) which is run by the insane workaholic Miranda Priestly. Andrea believes this is the step she needs to get into her journalism career! A job at a high end fashion magazine! But, as we all know, nothing is ever that simple.The movie is not the same as the book, but I like the think the quality of both are insanely good! Despite being different in plot, tone and character personalities, both works were fantastic! If you haven't read the book, I highly suggest it. It's unique and dramatic!Andrea's journey involves her changing (and sometimes growing) along the way, as she encounters all of the antics of being in the fashion world: uptight assistants, overbearing bosses, deadlines, insomnia, and work/life balance.This book is in it's own niche market - it became really popular, but it's not for everyone. The humor is a type of special, especially since you are following Andrea's life fall apart. For me, it's a five star book! It's interesting to watch the plot spiral out of control as your begging the author to give Andrea some type of happiness in the end. But honestly? It's kind of how life is - not perfect. Andrea is NOT perfect and she's definitely not the most likable character, but I grew to like her knowing all of the horror she was going through.Five out of five stars!!
