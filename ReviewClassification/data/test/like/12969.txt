Okay, I'm not ashamed to admit it- I stole this from my cousin. She didn't miss it as it was sneakily done. I had heard some raving reviews about this book from 'ole Goodreads and although as a child myself I was never a fan I thought I would give it a go. So, when I discovered the book and film The Grinch which is one of my favourites, and saw this book innocently laying on the table I thought that this was an opportunity to great to miss.I read this book and although I enjoyed it very much it just didn't have the charm of the Grinch for me. Maybe it is for even younger children than the Grinch but there was just something missing. Don't despair though, it is still as clever as his other works and is still worth a read.
