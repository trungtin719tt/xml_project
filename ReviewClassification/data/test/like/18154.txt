Crichton takes another swing at time travel. After a brainy first act that presents a layman's comprehension of quantum physics, the narrative shifts admirably into a more traditional adventure story about a group of college students trapped in France during the Hundred Years War, who have to use their modern educations of the 17th century to survive and get back home. One of the things I like about the science in Crichton's books is that it feels like he is explaining it to himself even as he explains it to the reader. You feel like you are going along with him on his quest for further research to make his story more compelling and rich. The premise is absurd, but awesome, and it's a credit to his patience and power as a writer of typically deadpan Hollywood prose that he is able to go to such great lengths to keep the pace tight, the pages turning and the discoveries believable and fresh.The book is shamelessly rife with action, romance, villainous mustache-twirling, and detailed descriptions of appalling gore (a character attempts to decapitate a marauding knight, but only manages to get his sword halfway through, then struggles to withdraw the weapon while dragging the guy around the room as blood spurts from his visor) which serve to root us in the dangerous, up-close brutality of historical warfare that the characters are confronted with, all the more believable thanks to the late doctor's firsthand knowledge of gaping wounds. On that same coin, the act of multidimensional transport is depicted as an aberration of nature, with costly and compounding effects on the human body, a welcome detail that is often ignored in these kinds of stories, which is strange because it would be THE FIRST THING ON MY MIND if someone offered to take me apart at a molecular level and rebuild me on the other side of space-time.Of course it's impossible to tell a story like this without calling upon loving homages to other classics, the likes of Treasure Island, A Yankee In King Arthur's Court and The Time Machine, stories the author no doubt grew up with. There is an excellent jousting sequence, and a climactic battle with no shortage of flaming arrows and scalding-hot oil. Like the contemporary heroes, we feel as though we are visiting not just a different time, but a different universe of meta-fiction. In Crichton's articulate words the fusion of modern physics and medieval warfare go together like chocolate and peanut-butter, or genetic engineering and dinosaurs.I am obligated to point out glaring plot holes so I will say that the form of time travel presented inTimelineis compelling, but inconsistent. A shocking discovery early on has the characters unearthing a pair of modern reading glasses at an archaeological dig site, tipping off the crew of the Mystery Machine to the fate of their professor. However, we learn later on that the evil corporate "3D fax machine" that makes the trip possible works, albeit clumsily, by extrapolating microscopic worm-holes in the quantum foam to effectively burrow into another universe where it is still the fourteenth century-- NOT the same as "going back" in time! This is a unique gimmick, one that the premise of the story is built upon, presumably to avoid the narrative issue of time paradoxes. Logically, anything the characters do in the "Feudal France Universe" should have no effect on our world. But for some reason they do, and it's distracting. So why did they keep finding hints of their past actions in another universe? Who cares.Despite this confusing point,Timelineis a fantastic, unpretentious, swashbuckling adventure yarn with cool science and cool action, and falls just outside what I would consider Crichton's "comfort zone". I kept expecting the story to end halfway through the book because he threw in the towel, stepped back and said "wow, this is retarded" and left the last hundred pages blank but he sees it through to the end and the gamut of modern adventure fiction is better off because of it.Also: If you harbor an ill opinion of this book and refuse to read it because you watched the awful film adaptation... buzz off?
