4 stars....I had never heard of this book until I starting searching for a book to fill the BT Bingo square "2016 Year of the Dragon". Of all the books I considered this one seemed to be the most appropriate being written by a Chinese lady and set in China, and with an average rating of 4.21 and almost 58K reviews I figured it would be something I'd enjoy. I figured wrong. Despite giving this book 4 stars I could not in all honesty say I found it an enjoyable read. Interesting, most definitely. Informative, without a doubt. But it was heavy reading and since I started it whilst I was still reading A Train In Winter I think the timing was probably wrong for me. That said, it was an excellent book which put the saying "1st world problems" into perspective. Throughout the book (which ran to 650 pages) I kept reflecting upon how fortunate we are and how grateful I am to live in Australia. It also made me reflect upon how much worse it would have been to live the experience than simply reading about it.This biography/autobiography published in 1991 told of the lives of the author her mother and grandmother. Considering my almost non-existent knowledge of Chinese history prior to starting this book there was so much for me to learn. It was a particularly interesting family and her story brought to light living conditions for her Grandmother as the Concubine of a Warlord; it told of her parents lives as officials in the Communist party; it told of her own life until her mid 20's growing up in a China in turmoil. It told of the conditions they all endured at different times under Japanese rule, under the Russians, under the Kuomintang, and later under the Communist rule of Chairman Mao. It told of famine conditions, of the Cultural Revolution, of the endless corruption that was prevalent in their community, ongoing fear of violence and the way in which the masses were brainwashed.The following passage which told of the authors feelings about her grandmothers death seemed to sum it up very well for meShe was a great character - vivacious, talented, and immensely capable. Yet she had no outlet for her abilities. The daughter of an ambitious small-town policeman, concubine to a warlord, stepmother to an extended but divided family, and mother and mother-in-law to two Communist officials - in all these circumstances she had little happiness. The days with Dr Xia were lived under the shadow of their past and together they endured poverty, Japanese occupation, and the civil war. She might have found happiness in looking after her grandchildren , but she was rarely free from anxiety about us. Most of her life she had lived in fear, and she faced death many times. She was a strong woman, but in the end the disasters which hit my parents, the worries about her grandchildren, the tide of ugly human hostility - all conspired to crush herQuite honestly I don't know how anyone survived the unimaginably terrible conditions but as I'm coming to learn the human race seems to have an amazing store of resilience. I am not sorry to have finished this book but I am equally not sorry for having read it.
