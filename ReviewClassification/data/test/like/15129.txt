How foolish I was to assume this would be a quick little read. I could not have been more wrong. I physically feel exhausted. How did Camus write this? The fall is as dense as they come, bitter, excruciating. Forces you to cogitate. The ideas are so repugnant and yet they keep gnawing inside your head. The words are like evil dark matter that establishes its authority right from the start and stays there dictating, vandalizing your property. I cannot believe I am giving this a 5 star rating. I don't know, perhaps it's a glimpse into a godless mind, a wretched heart drenched in hedonism, directionless and tired. It's unfortunate that people have to go through such misery.Also, it shows mirror to all of us, aren't we all hypocrites in one way or another? Writing this would have taken its toll on Camus, I am not ready to believe otherwise. The last few pages are going to stay with me, like headless serpents. I don't know, I feel blessed to be a believer, and also I'm shaken by this "quick little read".
