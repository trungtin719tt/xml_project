OMG OMG OMG!!!! This book is the reason I came up with six stars.I love Sookie, she is one of my favorite female protagonists. She has just the right amount of supernatural abilities combined with just the right amount of struggles with that power. Her life is hugely out of her control, yet she manages to fight for what little she can have.I love Eric. He is one of my three favorite vampires (the others being Thomas Raith from Jim Butcher's Dresden Files and Quinn from Keri Arthur's Riley Jensen series). The reason I started watching True Blood was Eric is cast perfectly. I LOVE Eric even more in this book. He has grown more than Sookie, which is pretty amazing for a vampire.One of the nice things about this book is since all Sookie books were back on the NYTimes Bestseller list, the book wasn't bogged down by retelling what happened in other books. Harris brought up lots of stuff that happened in other books to grow the seeds planted earlier, not to give us backstory.And boy do those seeds grow. We all know that Bill loves her (despite how they met) and is willing to lay down his life for her. We also know through what happened with Quinn that she needs to be the most important person in her man's life. She also believes Eric will always be number one in his life, which puts him out of the running.or does it?This book plants the seeds of doubt about Eric's self-centeredness and how he feels about Sookie. If I didn't love Eric already, I would now.The question I was left with was what about Sookie attracts Eric? Whatever it is happens preDead to the Worldwhen Sookie finds Eric running naked with no memory. I can't wait for him to tell Sookie what he feels and why in later books.
