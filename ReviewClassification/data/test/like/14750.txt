After reading Margitte's excellent review just now and browsing through this book again, I've decided to up my rating.* * * * * * * * *I see that I read this hardback in 1993. I will, when I get the time, reread it just to see how I now view it.It's the story of three Chinese woman and it is a memoir of Jung Chang, her mother and her grandmother.There are wonderful photos portraying China's history, although not necessarily pleasant memories.The author "grew up in Manchuria under Japanese and then Russian occupation".Yes, looking briefly again at the book, I highly recommend it.
