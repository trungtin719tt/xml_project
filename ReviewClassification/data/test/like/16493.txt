Well, whatdidI think? I've taken to reading best sellers lately. I want to know why they sell. So far, I haven't a clue. Maybe it's nothing more than genre. We went through our vampire years. And then came that wizard kid. (Or the other way round, I forget.) These were followed by zombies. But as I already know what to expect from Longfellow, I thought I'd try her latest. Well, blow me down with a bellows, it wasn't what I expected at all. This one was set in the present, it was about a "normal" American woman living a normal American life who does what so many wind up thinking they'll have to do. They'll end it all. A nice house, a nice car, an easy life, the kids grown and gone. You'd think it would be time to, I don't know... what do normal people do at this stage of their life? Buy a boat? Sail the Caribbean? But Mrs. Warner's husband is having an affair. Mrs. Warner is watching TV and taking a lot of Valium. Mrs. Warner's husband and his father are planning to have Mrs. Warner sent away to a nice "rest home" somewhere. When Mrs. Warner walks away before they can net her, she doesn't buy a plane ticket to Greece where she meets a good looking fisherman. Mrs. Warner walks out into the desert to die. And there begins a tale I spent the night reading non-stop. It was simple, it was fast, it was honest, it was funny, it was wonderful. God Bless Molly Brock (Mrs. Warner as was).
