Huge thanks to Julianna Helms for loaning me her ARC. Everybody go and give Julianna a cyber hug right now. GO.So today I was standing around in the kitchen in my underwear frosting cupcakes, and as I stared vacantly out of the window over the sink, I wondered, "What if I looked up and there was a zombie standing out there?"I frequently wonder this. Call me crazy, but when I finally peel myself away from my manuscript at about 3:30 in the morning and I let the dog out one last time, I bristle and wonder if, when I open the door, I'll hear that tell-tale ominous moan that marks the dawn of the apocalypse. What weapon would I use? A lamp? A chair leg? That piece of wood that the landlord inexplicably left leaning up against the back door before she was fired from caring for our property?The dog?Either I've been watching too much television, or I'm an idiot. Those are the only two options.Well, actually, you could always consider that perhaps my imagination is just inflated; that's neither a bad thing nor good. Alright, being incredibly imaginative does have its perks, especially when you're looking into joining the authorship train, but it also lends itself to crazy shit like this. You know, looking under your bed for ghouls before you get into it. Peering behind the curtains to make sure there isn't a demon waiting there only to jump out and lop your head off when you aren't looking.You lop someone's head off, bitch ain't going to be looking atanything.An imagination of the wild variety is the only thing that could have given birth to something as unique, colorful and adventurous as the Legend series. This is, most likely, one of my favorite series ever. It is absolutelyfantastic.AndProdigyjust blewLegend, its predecessor, right out of the water. It isbetterthanLegend.The characters probably aren't the best display of wild imagination; they're bright, great fun to follow and wonderfully rounded but I can't say they're the freshest tilapia on the chopping block. I'd say what really got me about this book and what really sold it to me was the intricacy and pace of the mind-bending plot.It moves at an absolutely breakneck speed, but somehow, probably through the beauty and skill of Marie's writing, it touches you. The dialogue, romance, deaths and action struck a real chord with me and pulled me in from the beginning. I opened this book and I literally could not stop reading until I was finished. I was forced - nay,compelledto keep turning pages and find out where the plot would move next, which was off the chess board, under the table and into the middle of the road where it caused a huge pile-up and several thousand awesome explosions. Reading this book is like being strapped into fucking Oblivion and forced to complete six rounds of it while someone holds a gun to your head and says, "If you pee your pants, I will shoot you."A quick low-down is that June and Day, our heroes, head to Las Vegas where they're welcomed into the fold of the Patriots, who are anti-Republic revolutionaries. They begin hatching a plan to assassinate the new Elector, a young hot one who came into power after the old Elector suddenly died. This plan involves June and Day being pushed around like chess pieces, and along the way they discover secrets about the plan, the Republic and themselves that forces them to question everything they believe is true.There's also lots of making out, sploding, fighter jets, soul-destroying death, kicking and punching, sexy military uniforms, adorable children, jewellery, betrayal, selflessness, selfishness, lover's quarreling and a big, fat love square.The love square was fucking awesome.(view spoiler)[My GOD, I want June to be with Anden in the next book. The whole thing was left hanging at the end, and as much as I love Day, I just...UGH. Anden. I fucking love that guy. He's absolutely gorgeous. However, I do not want Day and Tess to be together. It's just weird. They don't make a good match at all.(hide spoiler)]But man - the twists in this book left me reeling. At the beginning I was all cocky, thinking I had it all sorted out, but by halfway through I was on the edge of my seat gnawing my fingernails down to the quick, because the plot veered in so many shocking directions that I just didn't know what was going to happen next. And the ending! The ending completely blindsided me. I didn't know what the hell to make of it. It just happened, this huge bombshell, and I was left reeling.How do you deal with that shit? And I can't even spoil it for you all and tell you what happens until January! This sucks!I said before that the plot surpassed the characters, but that's not to say the cast of this story wasn't a shining beacon of gloriousness. As usual to begin with we had a little problem with June and Day sounding the same but after a while they grew into their habits, and I could separate their voices. Once you know the characters well enough to pick up on their subtle mannerisms, it becomes easy to determine who's inner monologue is who's.There are just so many awesome characters inProdigy. Razor was fascinating, and as usual Kaede's spunk had me snorting into my coffee. June and Day are very solid protagonists, each flawed but entirely lovable. They work as a great team, sparring off one another. They're both capable, intelligent, interesting heroes that I found myself really invested in.Their romance is something I'm still on the fence about, but the emotive element is there and it shows. They have chemistry, enough to make me buy their affection, but I can't say I was blown away by the romantic element. Still, the great thing about this series is that the romance is not a central part of the storyline, and if it were omitted, the series would still be as compelling and fun to follow.The secondary characters made the cast for me. I was absolutely heartbroken about Metias, and the truth about his death.(view spoiler)[Oh, hell to the no! As if Metias's death wasn't tragic enough. We're now hit in the face with the revelation that he was actually in love with Thomas, who then went on to kill him because he was ordered to by Commander Jameson. Okay, so part of me wants to believe that he couldn't have done it and he's lying to protect...someone, and because he never really gave a direct...oh, who the fuck am I kidding. Thomas is deplorable. He knew that Metias was in love with him and he killed him anyway. I know he felt that he had no choice but for fuck's sake, Thomas obviously loved Metias back and what he died was unforgivable. What a piece of shit.(hide spoiler)]It was awful, painful, brutal. And that's the essence of it; this book is written with so much heart and skill that in a few sentences you can become so invested in a character or backstory that it just pulls you in. I had such a strong emotional reaction to Metias. Even dead, he played a huge part in the rest of the book, and I loved that. I loved that the relationship between he and June remained a part of the story and a part of her motivation.Other characters, such as the hilariously wonderful Pascao and sweet little Tess added lovely gold embellishments to what was already a great story. The only character-based gripe I have is that I'm unsure what Commander Jameson's role was in this book. I felt like she needn't have been there - she really added nothing to the conflict. Just a minor nitpicky thing there.The writing was spectacular, the plotline tight and beautifully paced, the characters colorful and brilliantly crafted. The ending broke my heart, but at this point I'm wondering where the series has left to go.Prodigyhas an extremely interesting ending, in that it ties up most if not all loose ends. I'm curious to find out what could possibly happen next, so I'm of course going to wait with baited breath for the third installment, and probably enter into some kind of Hunger Games-esque duel in order to acquire an ARC. I cannot wait two years for the next book. I will die. I will actually die.I mean, I just...The ending.THE ENDING.*There's only two days to go and I can't hold on any longer and I have to say it, but if you look at this fucking spoiler tag before you read the book I will hunt you down and make you sorry.*(view spoiler)[OH MY GOD, when Kaede died I cried a river and then some. How is this? How? How is it even...? Why did...? I don't even...? And then Day has a brain tumor and it's inoperable, and despite knowing for absolutely sure that someone will find a way to save him in the last book, because he's Day and he's a special snowflake, I'm still sitting in a corner jittering in terror. How could you do this to me, Marie Lu? Did I hurt you in some way? Are you punishing me personally? Fuck this. Fuck that. Fuck everything! Let me go cry again because the agony is like a crocodile chewing on my soul.(hide spoiler)]Excuse me while I lie in a snotty, sweaty, sobbing heap on the floor, clutching a frosting can full of my feelings.In short: this book is fucking amazing. When it comes out in January, you had all better get in line behind me to buy a hardback copy. Because I'm going to read this shit again. And again.And again.
