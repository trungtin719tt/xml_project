In a way it's a real shame that this book will forever be connected (and usurped in the minds of most) by the iconic Tom Hanks movie. I found this book on my father's shelf and the cover- featuring a mongoloid-looking face- grabbed me almost instantly. When I started to read, I wasn't disappointed.The big reason I think you are seeing so many low ratings for this book is simple- This is a much darker book than the movie is.Forrest Gump is about how we people have to overcome all the bad things that happen to them, as shown through the eyes of the most innocent, gullible, and abused man ever.Many of the elements of the movie are still there, but this is the Hyde to Mr. Jekyll's... Jekyll.I think a lot of people today pick up this book expecting a spiritual pick-me-up, only to find its a spiritual kick in the gut. That said, I think people need more spiritual kicks to the gut these days.I think Forrest Gump -the novel- had a lot to do with how much I've tried to be empathetic towards people as I've grown up. It is a tough novel to read. And, while things turn bad for Fortest time and time again, you have to be uplifted a bit that, despite all the awful crap, life moves on.
