Decades ahead of its time. I don't understand how it is possible for a person to write these kinds of emotions so succinctly. Shut up and take my stars.Wecaught me during a bad week - worksplosion, hormonesplosion, general worriedness about the state of the world. I don't want to talk about it in superlatives, but I think this book has been one of the good things to happen to me lately. Certainly it's one of the things I want to remember.PREVIOUSLY -Fun fact: this is the first book I ever bought my gentleman du jour - it was his birthday, we had known each other about a month, and I spent ages in bookshops looking for something that might make me seem suave and interesting. This was over a year ago and I have still never read it. To date, then, gentleman du jour remains suaver and more interesting than me. BUT NO LONGER.
