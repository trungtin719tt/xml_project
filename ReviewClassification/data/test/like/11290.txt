Well holy shit!!I was looking for some little horrors to keep me occupied while awaiting an email from a friend with their book. I was told to give this a go. It both scared the crap out of me and made me livid.Well it scared the crap out of me while reading it and then made me angry when I read more about Charlotte Perkins Gilman.This story was written after she was put on the 'rest-cure' after giving birth to her daughter. Who would like to know what the 'rest-cure' entailed of?In 1892, feminist writer Charlotte Perkins Gilman published "The Yellow Wallpaper", a horror short story based on her experience when placed under the rest cure from Dr. Silas W. Mitchell himself.She wasn't allowed to write in a journal, paint a picture, or release her imagination in any way, though she was artistically inclined. If she ever felt ill, she was simply told to return to bed. Her specific instructions from Dr. Mitchell were to "Live as domestic a life as possible. Have your child with you all the time... Lie down an hour after each meal. Have but two hours' intellectual life a day. And never touch pen, brush or pencil as long as you live."Gilman abided by Mitchell's instructions for several months before practically losing control of her sanity.And what type of people were typically given this oh so wonderful and helpful cure? Why women of course!!! We are the hysterical and weaker sex after all.Charlotte Perkins Gilman was certainly a women born before her time. She sent a copy of 'The Yellow Wallpaper' to Dr. Mitchell after it was published. She also mentions him by name in the story and throws massive shade at him which makes me think she was all kinds of awesome.This is certainly a powerful insight into a time when women had such little autonomy over their own bodies that it's terrifying to think about and why I think this works so well as a horror story. It's also important to keep in mind that there are still places in the world where women still don't have autonomy over their own bodies, my own country being one such place until very recently.
