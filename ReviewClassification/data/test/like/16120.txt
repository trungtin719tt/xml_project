The only Palahniuk book I've read to date is "Fight Club" - and that is such a great book with such a great movie adaptation (watched it before I read it btw)."Survivor" was an interesting story, with the (somewhat gimmicky) page numbers going backwards (to compel you to get to the end?). Haha. What was this about? A poke at marketing-driven franchises? The sorry state of money driven religions/churches? A handbook of cleaning tips (a part of me was hoping for the secrets of the removal of chewing gum from clothes would be mentioned somewhere - no such luck, I was tempted to take notes though)?The voice is actually quite similar to "Fight Club" in feel. Endless rattling of anecdotal statistics/facts in between commentaries and it even has it's own version of Marla and Tyler Durden type characters.Quite an interesting read actually. Liked it.Writing: 5, Story: 3, Cleaning tips: 4 (chewing gum, man, chewing gum!). So... 4?I am interested to see how Palahniuk's other titles read now, I wonder if they all sound 'similar'. Hmm...
