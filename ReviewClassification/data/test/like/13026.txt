This was an intriguing book to read but the review was complicated by the fact I kept pursuing various trails....The story consists of three consecutive post-apocalyptic periods subsequent to a nuclear catastrophe, separated from that and from each other by centuries. Central to the plot is a monastery dedicated to the preservation of knowledge from our lost civilization during the dark ages that follow and to the memory of its founder, Isaac Edward Liebowitz, who, although apparently a Jew (based on his name and the fact that he ate bagels, which in the 1950s were not yet as American as apple pie), avails himself of monastic sanctuary and order in the service of his mission. We hark back to the role of European monasteries in preserving knowledge during the medieval period, even when they didn't know what it was they were preserving.The book is darkly funny at times, more so nearer the first.Leibowitzis a story emerging from Western civilization and Christianity. Yes, Catholicism in particular--but thatwasChristianity in the West during the era that contributes the book's prototype. Taking the book as it is, it has a Christian viewpoint. Saying it doesn't would be silly.Since that's the case, you can't rationalize away that Leibowitz is a Jew as being a random coincidence, as attempted in the discussion thread on one friend's review. There will be Jews involved in key roles.If not random, then perhaps Miller uses them in an anti-Jewish manner, as another of my friends thinks, especially re "the wandering Jew" motif.More on that motif in a minute. Generally speaking, the book portrays Christianity as the religion of the land, with Judaism surviving in the persona of Benjamin Eleazar/Lazarus (Lazarusbeing a Latinate form ofEleazar). Even he has a Christianized view ofmessiah--a view so prevalent in our culture that it's hard to have any other.I remember nary an allusion to any other religion.That's about the worst of it: Christianity is front and center while other religions are invisible except for the Judaic references.Well, in the first chapter, Eleazarismade to "bleat" his blessing. Usually one hears "intone." It's hard for people from the Christian tradition to imagine Jewish prayers could be beautiful.Still, not so bad, as these things go.The Wandering Jew motif makes an appearance here. A few years ago my reaction to a friend's short story led me to the wandering Jew:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...In the present book, the Old Jew could be Leibowitz himself, as they share the same "wry" smile. Then again, the Old Jew could be a Christ-like figure; he's bearing the impossible weight of his whole people, as per the discussion with Dom Paolo in Part II.As the Old Jew stands in for all Israel (the people), you could say that so does the Jesus figure of Christian scripture. He encapsulated for the prospective Christians the entire People of Israel, whose absence in their own personal histories required replacement so that, without the chain of history and tradition Jews had, they too could be connected to the God of Israel.If the role of the wanderer is pejorative, what does it mean that ultimately it is Brother Joshua's group who take up that role? (See the third paragraph in Chapter 28.)Note that calling Eleazar "the Old Jew" is not anti-Jewish, even if it makes some readers uncomfortable. "Jew" is not a dirty word. Although historically made that way by Christianity, it has now been reclaimed by Jews. So, no further need for "Hebrew" or "Israelite," etc., as a replacement term.It strikes me as unusual that there were Hebrew blessings, not to mention written Hebrew, in this book. Maybe I just haven't come across that during recent years when I would have noticed it. Including that strikes me, if anything, as philo-Judaism.Remember, too, Abbot Zerchi's rant about the"King of the Universe, nailed on a cross as a Yiddish schlemiel by the likes of us."(Schlemiel = unlucky person. God only knows why the author threw in Yiddish, although we could rationalize that little details such as one-and-a-half millennia or more might be lost by one looking back over so much time.)I also wondered if the reference to"Infinite Sense of Humor"in that same rant has anything to do with the book titleInfinite Jest--a stab in the dark since that's a book I haven't read.Leibowitzstimulates digressive thinking....Where do the blessings, the Hebrew, and the reference to Yiddish come from? I found myself wondering about the author's bio, about which little is known. Could he have been a Jew who converted to Catholicism? Or maybe he served with Jews during the war and had a Jewish friend.There were several lines of Hebrew that I tried to read. First of all I had to review my aleph-bet, which I had learned in 2014 for an adult bat mitzvah. Complicating things, the vowel sounds aren't included here. Google finally helped me out by sending me to the "talk" section behind theA Canticle for LeibowitzWkipedia page (which, by the way, is designated as a good article). See especially numbers 2,3, and 26 of the index.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk%3A...As an example of the complications of the Hebrew in the book, at the end of Chapter 25 where the Hebrew for "Lazarus" is spelled out and the transliteration given, two of the Hebrew letters are wrong. There's an ayin instead of a tzadei and a vov instead of a reish. The errors are with letters that resemble each other. The author's error?The book's culminating image, which I won't spoil by revealing, seemed to me to be an unusual one in this context--but maybe not, as an image something like that has occurred to me.Judaism and Christianity remain intertwined. I don't expect that most people have such a notion. Some might consider Judaism as an excrescence on the body of Christianity, but a double-helix relationship between the two religions probably makes a more dignified image. (I didn't make up that image either; got it from Lawrence Hoffman and a rabbi he trained.)Who can say what Walter M. Miller, Jr.'s intention was? I think he's written a fascinating book.Did he intend to propose a flip, what with the Leibowitz monks now becoming the wanderers? Or is that inadvertent?I bought the audio on sale from Audible some time ago, probably after seeing reviews from Goodreads friends. But definitely needed the book, too, for this one.The narrator, who does a knock-down bang-up job, is a bit of a mystery, too, to me. His name is Tom Weiner, and he's an actor who according to Wikipedia also has used the names Tom Wyner and Tom Halperin. I found this, too:http://www.audiofilemagazine.com/narr...When I googled "Is Leibowitz a Jew?" I found this:http://www.shmoop.com/a-canticle-for-...As you can see, that's one section among many. If you're having fun, you could wander for days in this maze.I'll end with the 2014New Yorkerarticle I've already posted on some friends' reviews:http://www.newyorker.com/books/page-t......and I'll try to answer any questions forthcoming about what I've written here.P.S.
