At midnight on the night of December 8, 1941 men from the 8th Indian brigade stationed in northeastern Malaya came under heavy Japanese bombardment and by December 12 two beachheads and key airport had fallen to the Japanese. With astonishing speed, across jungles the British had wrongly assumed were impenetrable, the Japanese advanced down the Malay peninsula, pushing the British south until, on February 15, 1942, the British were forced to surrender the key southern port city of Singapore to Japan.Malaysia had been an important British colony--source of nearly 40% of the world's rubber and even more of tin. Many of the British elite were evacuated fairly early--here a group of British women take tea on their way to Penang. They were among the lucky ones.Courtesy ofSpirit of Malaysia, which has lots of historic photographs and stories about WWII in South Asia.For others--both colonial soldiers, and civilian men and women, the Japanese conquest would mark the start of three years of horror. Many would not survive.A Town Like Aliceis the story of two whodidsurvive--through wits, courage and true grit. It is also a story of how those survivors rebuilt their lives, and with equal determination, built a new world on the rugged outback of Australia.At the heart of the story is a young British woman, Jean Paget, born in Malaya who takes up a secretarial post only to find herself caught up in the invasion. Thanks to her language skills and sharp intelligence, Jean becomes thede factoleader of a group of 14 women prisoners and 19 children. Marched from town to town, half would perish of disease and exhaustion. At one desperate juncture, they meet up with two Australian soldiers--also POWs--and one of them, a cheerful and resourceful young man named Joe Harmon risks his life to help the women.For Jean, memories of Joe, of their conversations about Australia, of the food that he steals for the women, and of his ultimate sacrifice haunt her in the years to come. When she inherits a small fortune, Jean returns to Malaya to the village that sheltered her for two years, and ultimately to Australia, in hopes of finding Joe alive.I won't say too much more for fear of spoiling the delights for new readers, but it is in Australia, at a dreadful cattle station on the outback of Queensland, that Jean discovers her true gift as an entrepreneur and pioneer. There's a little bit of romance (there could have been a bit more IMO); lots of great descriptions of Australia in the 1950s and a truly kick-ass heroine--with a great head for business.In the process you'll learn about:Cattle herding on the outbackThe endless worries about waterHow to make crocodile shoesAnd why friendship, humor and hard work are the best foundation for marriage.Buddy Read with Tadiana, February, 2015.Content rating PG for wartime violence, brief scenes of torture, some coarse language and mild sexual content.
