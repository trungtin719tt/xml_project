Beautiful!It's weird because there's something amateur? unintellectual? about his writing, yet it's profoundly wise and he comes up with poetic comparisons all over the place. I can't place it. Maybe the characters are a bit too cheesy at times. Hopeless romantic? I don't know. But he writes about insanely tragic things and with utter understanding. This and Prince of Tides are very healing books - they have a raw power.One paragraph summed up my Mom in such beauty that that is all I need to know. I can stop trying to figure her out. That paragraph was insanely healing.I can't imagine the utter grief and loss he must have experienced in his lifetime - you can tell he writes what he knows.His knowledge on the holocaust was amazing also. It brought to light the idea of fear and how "to fear only cowardice" is so important, in life and if not followed allows the holocaust to happen and allows you to be reduced to sub human.I watched Moulin Rouge shortly after and realized how profound Toulouse's character is. The Bohemian Revolution has a negative conotation to it and yet I can see exactly where and why it sprung up when people allowed themselves to be reduced to dogs - not human at all anymore and really all that matters is truth, beauty and freedom and love. Without those elements we are nothing but cowards and there's no point to living. Like in the Mao regime - all based on fear - fear of what I don't know what was Mao afraid of to hate protest beauty enforcing grass to be picked?
