Re-read on Xmas!And it couldn't have better timing. Who else would like to see Death taking on the role of Discworld's Santa?Or better yet, have Susan get involved. :)Or have a hit put out on the Hogfather while Death flies with the pigs?OR HAVE TO DEAL WITH RIDCULLY's BATH? *shudder*Well, here's to ants in the AI! I've just upped my score on this one to a full five. For some reason, this Pratchett tickled me in all the best places. :)
