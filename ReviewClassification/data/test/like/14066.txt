This book was amazing. If I had the regular time for reading, I would not have pulled this book down till I finished it. I can rate it among the top 5 books ever read. The lives of two different individuals from different backgrounds and different parts of the world are shown in an awesome way. The thing that matters most is that the storyline and pace are maintained throughout the book and this provides a great sense of enjoyment. Apart from this, the timing of most events breathes a new zeal in the theme of the book in various parts. The events are like an economic recession in 1929, slave markets in the middle east, battles of the company board of directors, crime and cruelty in wars. Apart from these, the willpower of the characters to achieve their goals and reach the highest level from birth till death are indicated in a very beautiful way.
