This was the best one of them all. It fills in all the holes and makes for a fascinating read. The only character who didn't seem to fit in with the story was the Baby character who killed her mother and father. The only thing I could figure out was that she gave us Anne Rice's ideas of the afterlife. That you just go up into a wonderful loving place with all the people in your life even if you were a horrible person. The rest was sheer creativeness. That a vampire could be so ancient and complete he/she didn't need to kill anymore was cool. The idea that an ancient making a new vampire made a "super" vampire was cool also. And Lestat was right, Louis does whine a lot! :)
