I had no idea what to expect with my first reading of Pushkin and perhaps that's why I felt a bit unsure at the beginning. I'd seen a ballet ofOnegina few years ago, so perhaps I had other expectations due to that as well. And then I wondered if it was the translation; but I've since read of how it reads in Russian, and it seems the translation is just fine. Once I got in the swing of this formal structure with very 'informal' words, I really enjoyed it.This is really much more than just a story of a man and a woman who can't click with each other at the right time. The narrator (who is -- and isn't -- Pushkin, I imagine) is the main voice. He meditates on the nature of art; his own progression from poetry to prose; the roles that we take on and then that become us from what we read and from what we learn from our readings; and much more. The narrator is funny, and he is serious.I would need to study and know much more to get everything I could out of this book.
