The Guardian. A novel that included not only the genre of romanticism but the theme of love and danger.What can I say? I was captivated by this book. This book was different from any of Nicholas Sparks' novels. The fact that it was a love story between two good old friends is the kind of love story that interests me. I felt that Mike and Julie's realisation for their love for each other was beautiful and I love how they acted naturally in sync. And the fact that there was a bad guy from the beginning till the end was another interesting thing about the book. The whole time i was reading the book it was as if i was watching a really good movie. It was easy for me to imagine the scenes and the music. I must say that Richard's character was developing slowly but in a good way. Page by page you can see that he slowly begins to show the real him. And I don't want to spoil it for you guys, but what I can say is this: If you're looking for a romantic story that is not predictable nor cheesy and that it involves an element of danger and suspense then you've got the right book.The book was well written .. the story was different .. The story had elements of familiarity with the different characters that I could easily see in our normal everyday life. i also enjoyed reading about the basic interactions with Julie and her dog, Singer. How is it possible that I fell in love with a dog that doesn't exist?In conclusion, Nicholas Sparks has captivated my emotions and he has done a job well-done at that I may add.If i were to rate this book from a million, I'd give it two million stars! If that sounded stupid I apologise.
