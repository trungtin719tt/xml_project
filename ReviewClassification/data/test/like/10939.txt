Visuals for Adamhttp://irresistiblereads.blogspot.com..."She kissed me good-bye. She told me that she loved me more than life itself. Then she stepped through security.She never came back."Note:My review is not going to do this book justice. I don't think I can possibly express how awesome Where She Went is.Wow! Where She Went is an intense and breathtaking read. I have to admit I enjoyed If I Stay but I wouldn't say I loved it. But Where She Went is one theBESTbooks I have ever read. It made my heart ache, it made me smile and of course cry my eyes out (within the first 50 pages might I add).This story really got under my skin. It consumed my thoughts andI HAD TOread it all in one sitting otherwise I would have been a complete mess. I had to know whether Adam and Mia where going to be okay? Whether they were going to move on or get back together? Because Adam and Mia are characters that you get completely and utterly emotionally invested in.What to say about Adam? He is intense, broken and flawed (and another musician ~swoons~). The way Forman writes I felt like I could feel every bit of his pain (and it hurt like hell).Mia, I adore too. I thought I would be mad with her for breaking Adam's heart. But I understood why Mia choose to make that decision to leave Adam thanks to Forman writing such well crafted and believable characters.The writing is the kind I love - simple yet beautiful and powerful. There are parts of Adam's song lyrics at the beginning of most chapters. I really love books that music plays an important part of and Forman really expresses both Adam's and Mia's passion for music.Overall, I am just blown away by the heart in this story. Where She Went is a must read for everyone!***A FAVOURITE READ OF 2011***A BIG THANK YOU TO ALEXA FOR SHARING YOUR COPY. YOU ARE THE BEST
