This story took me completely by surprise. WOW.I knew nothing about it going in besides the fact that it is based off events in Homer's,The Illiad. Despite the fact that I took 4-years of Latin in high school, I couldn't tell you the first thing aboutThe Illiad.I was completely floored by theabsolute beautyof this story.The center of the tale is the love between Achilles and Patroclus. I am not aromancereader AT ALL and oftentimes the romance will be my least favorite aspect of a given story but for some reason...this one...struck me straight in the feels.There was something sopure and confidentin their love. They were loyal and brave and kind to one another in a way that had me reaching for the tissues instead of choking down my mirth.I just knew from my level of attachment that this one wasn't going to end well for me. Puddle, puddle of goo, right on the floor. I was overwhelmed by the intensity of feeling this story was able to elicit from my cold, dark heart.The Ice Queen hath melteth.If you are considering reading this yourself, for whatever reason, I cannot recommend the audiobook enough. This narrator absolutely nailed the feeling of the story. His voices for all characters was just so expressive and was always recognizable for who he was portraying at the time.In particular, his voice when speaking as Achilles, straight up Chris Hemsworth. Honestly, not a bad picture to have in mind whilst listening to a book.To sum it all up:READ THIS BOOK!The world would indeed be a better place if this book were required reading and I honestly believe that.
