This was one of those books that I knew I was going to give 5 stars from page one. It's justbrilliant.I loved every single thing about it. I loved the writing style, characters, story, how it dealt withsooomany important themes... just everything. I especially enjoyed reading from A's point of view. I loved his way of thinking so much.And it really made me think about life, and some things that I haven't thought about before. And I love when a book does that.Can't wait for to sequel to come out, 'cause I'm going to read it the day it does.
