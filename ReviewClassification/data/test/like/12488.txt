Call me Elinor.Being the older sibling, while growing up I often felt like I was shoved into the role of being the sensible one, the reasonable one, the responsible one. That is how I was seen. That is what people believed of me. Underneath the skin of the rational, reserved tut-tutter writhed an often non-sensical, unreasonable, irresponsible being. But it took the occurrence of extreme circumstances for others to see it.Such is the life of Elinor Dashwood, the elder sister in a small, displaced family of all females. It is her younger, flightier sister Marianne who seems to grab life by the balls. By all outward appearances, Marianne is the feeling one.Revealing the depths of the true feelings these two sisters experience, whether on their sleeves or behind seemingly impenetrable layers of veils, is the goal Jane Austen set herself inSense and Sensibility, and she achieved it spectacularly. With alternately bold and subtle strokes, the author created a masterwork of intricate design. One criticism might be that the design is too delicate in places (a cracked block or two out of the many solid ones upon which the premiss is built or too much of a reliance on happenstance), but it is not enough to deter from the overall achievement: Austen's triumphant capture of human behavior and that odd incarnation of emotion in early 19th century Britain.
