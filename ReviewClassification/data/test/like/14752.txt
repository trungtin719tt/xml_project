I've never felt so sad to reach the end of a book in all my life. This book is amazing and is well and truly the best book I've ever read! I even had the urge to start reading it all over again as soon as I'd finished.Wild Swansfollows the journey of three generations of women, from the same family, through the tragic history of twentieth century China.I felt almost ashamed that I wasn't aware of hardly any of China's recent history. I picked the book up as I was doing a charity trek along the Great Wall in August 2008 and felt I should brush up on the history of the country. Although I had read wonderful things about this book I was prepared for a dull history lesson, one that I felt I had to put myself through. Sure it was a history lesson, but a breathtaking, extraordinary, unforgettable one. I struggled to remember that what I was reading was a true story, an account of three peoples' lives!No one told me this book was banned in China. So in my hand luggage it went, luckily I, and the book, made it there and back safely. I wish I had managed to finish it before I left for China, but when I returned from my trip I was even more eager to learn about the wonderful country I had just visited!This book is outstanding! It's not possible to put into words how much I enjoyed it. Please, just read it!!
