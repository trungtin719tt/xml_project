Well, this story blew me to Pluto. Dang, I really didn't think a writer could snatch all of your emotions with words on a page and drag it anyway they choose, but JLA has done exactly that. Yet again.Every book in the Lux series is better than the last one. There's just no limit to how awesome and intriguing these stories are!I loved the part of their new identities how JLA incorporated the two main characters of the Sweet Evil trilogy, and used their names as Kat and Daemon's new ones, that was really awesome! Fantastic story, but what was really 'WOW' was the that ending!An amazing read, really recommend&lt;3
