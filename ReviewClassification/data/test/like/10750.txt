Have you got.......... THE FEVER?KMM's Fever series has been the talk of GR town for the past two months.My interest was first piqued back in December. I'd been going about my daily business here on GoodReads (by which I mean I was stalking everyone I know), when up pops an update relating to something called a... Barrons? I ignored it.But then up pops another. And another. AND ANOTHER. This went on for about 90 minutes.My curiosity got the better of me: WHAT is a Barrons and WHY is everyone talking about it?...and more importantly WHERE can I get one???The many ladies who hang out at the Fever Water Cooler are constantly gushing over the unparalleled hotness of a one Jericho Barrons. They claim he is THE most delicious thing to have ever graced our bookshelves. Let me be the one to tell you:THEYWERENOTKIDDINGI have done nothing, NOTHING at all for the past four days except drink coffee, pee when necessary, and swoon over Jericho Barrons.And now it's over. *Cue my husbands' giant sigh of relief*So here's a question for you Karen Marie. What the FECK am I supposed to do now?
