What made this novel so awesome? The plot. I didn't love this novel because of the characters. I loved this novel because of the intricately weaved, never a dull moment plot... the history of the characters and their mythology. I absolutely fell for this story. It's action packed. I am not exaggerating when I say there isn't a dull moment... there's not! Nothing is what it seems... one word I wouldn't use to describe this novel is predictable. I had lot's of moments where my mouth was hanging open... I mean it was literally hanging open and usually gasping.I really need to get over my apprehension of reading books that I really want to like. Am I the only one that does that. I'll hear about a book, that has everything that I think would make an awesome book, but then I'm afraid to read it because it may not live up to my expectations.... what is my problem. Nightshade was one of those books. I thought it sounded epic.... but could it really be that good? It was. And I have been kicking myself in the ass since I read it for not devouring it back in May when I had a chance to.Let's talk about characters. Calla. I liked this girl. She was a very strong, resilient character. She has to be to a certain extent because she's an Alpha, but I think her Alpha status only magnifies those qualities, it doesn't define them. Ren and Shay were a toss up for me. I'm not really sure if I like either of them at this point. The characters that I did love: the pack members. The whole dynamic of the pack interaction was very fascinating. I need some more of that!Nightshade is the perfect blend of everything I love in a novel. There is engaging plot, well written characters, romance and a BEAUTIFUL cover. I have to admit the cover is what initially drew me in.I'm eagerly awaiting Wolfsbane!
