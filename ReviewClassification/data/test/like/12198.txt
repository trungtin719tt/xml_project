I had no interest in reading ODD THOMAS when it first came out. Although Watchers, Lightning, and some of Koontz's older novels are some of my favorites, I had read a few of his more recent novels and had been a little disappointed. But...I was browsing in the used book store and decided what the heck, I will pick up a copy just in case I ever change my mind. It took 7 years.[image error]The great thing about it taking 7 years is I forgot what the book was about so I got to have the "Big Ahhhaaaaa" moment in the first chapter. Sometimes being clueless CAN be a good thing.In almost all of the Dean Koontz books I have read, I find that I quickly grow attached to central characters he introduces. I am always on board with them on their journeys and adventures, and constantly worry about their welfare. This was no exception. ODD THOMAS had me at hello!
