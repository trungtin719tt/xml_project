It was absolutely wonderful. I started it like an hour ago, and I already savored its 170 pages. Crying, the last fifty or so. It's similar to Night of Rodanthe, but its better, sweeter, shorter and sadder.I want a love like this, but one that can happen. Not one tainted with already present responsibilities. Ie: I am NOT supporting adultery, I banish the thought. She should have divorced and moved on-- be brave if true love finds you.It ended as happily as a novel like this could.Its also made me mildly interested in photography. Funny how that works.AFTERTHOUGHTS:I just read some of the comments about this book from others... They're all so negative and hateful I can only laugh. I feel bad for the people that didn't enjoy this book. They obviously couldn't open up to how wonderful the novel could be for them.Don't close your mind off to it, try it. If you don't like it, you don't like it. But maybe you will.
