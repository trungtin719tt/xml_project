Stephen King has stated that Matheson had one of the biggest influences on him as any other writer and I can see why after reading this masterpiece. This book is actually a collection of short stories accompanying 'I Am Legend' or I may have given it 5 stars...maybe.Already being weakened by the tragedy of losing your wife and child, could you then find it within yourself to survive an apocalyptic nightmare? And if you were strong enough to survive, how long would you even want to hold on to your life as the weight of loneliness slowly pulled you into insanity?Forget the movie adaption of this book that starred Will Smith. I'm not saying the movie was bad, but it was so far outside Matheson's novel that the two barely have any recognizable parallels. As a matter of fact, having watched the movie first, I had no idea that the creatures hunting Neville were vampires.There are only a few vampire novels that I think could surpass or equal 'I Am Legend'. I won't give anything away, but there was only one area of the writing that fell flat or else I would say this was a 5 star novel. If I had not known that Matheson wrote this in 1954 I may not have even noticed the time lapse. It's one of the things that makes this tale so easy to read; it doesn't have that antiquated feel that so many older books do. If you are a fan of horror, especially in the sub-genre of vampire horror, then 'I Am Legend' is a must read.
