WWII POWs in Malaya; alligator shoes and ice cream in rural AustraliaA Town Like Alice is a "bonza" book (as one of its main characters, Joe Hardman of Australia, would say) about two love stories, two adventures and two remarkable characters inspired by a real-life man and woman who displayed remarkable bravery during WWII. Nevil Shute gives these two people new fictional lives, and as Joe and Jean they are inspirationally resilient as prisoners of war in Japanese-occupied Malaya and afterwards in mid-century outback Australia.This 1995 Reader Digest edition of the classic novel (written in 1949 and first published in 1950) is appropriately mid-century in its aesthetic, including the cover design, mossy green binding and colour illustrations by Benjamin Russell Warner. The brief afterword by Lynne Johnson adds value to the volume.And "Oh my word!" Nevil Shute's use of Queensland vernacular is fascinating, and led me to Ozwords, a blog from the Australian National Dictionary Centre, where I found "Nevil Shute and A Town Like Alice" by by Amanda Laugesen. I recommend checking it out before or after reading A Town Like Alice if you, like me, are a bit of a "wordie" (my own word for someone who like words and language):http://ozwords.org/?p=3686
