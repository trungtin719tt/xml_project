Please excuse my ramblings, I readA Monster Callsin three hours and I am still extremely emotional. I should not have been given access to a computer after such a powerful book.As I am writing this, there are still tears coursing down my face--black from my mascara. I may look like something straight out of a horror movie, but my soul feels lighter somehow. I was fooled into thinking this would be a simple story as it is only 200 pages, but it is not. It issonot. This book is raw and emotional and cathartic. It deals with grief, loss, and anger in ways I have never read about before, but only experienced. I don't know what else to say except that everyone should read this book at least once.
