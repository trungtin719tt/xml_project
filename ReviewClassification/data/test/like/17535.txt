How do I go about describing this book? It reminded me of when I readA History of God: The 4,000-Year Quest of Judaism, Christianity, and Islamsome years ago, or maybe I should say I tried to read it because I'm not sure how much of it I truly understood.In this installment of the Vampire Chronicles, Rice takes on one of the biggest controversies in theology today, why is there suffering in our world? Why does G-d allow evil to exist in His world, His creation? Lestat attempts to find out through listening to the story of Creation, of Christ, of G-d and the Devil. This book will take your breath away!I wonder if anyone has thought to teach, to study Rice's books as an exercise in discussing religion?That would be a class I'd love to take.
