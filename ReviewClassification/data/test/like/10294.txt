This book is so so so gooooooooooooood!! Drop everything and go read it!LIST OF LOVES:~Liam is the greatest cinnamon roll sweetheart cheeseball to ever walk the earth... Just sayin'.~Zu is the most adorable, precious, and underestimated thing ever!~Chubs broke my heart like 17 times~Ruby (MC) was pretty awesome~Also, the protagonist wasn't whiny. THIS IS SUCH A RARE TRAIT THANK YOU RUBY!!!~Attention was grabbed right from the beginning~But seriously guys, Liam is incredible!~Perfect number of flashbacks to give insight but not drag~Kept up the pacing right to the end~I was never bored~Plot was unpredictable (for me at least)~Liam.~I mean like, the whole cast of characters~LIAM!!!The tiny nitpicky details I didn't like so much:~Ruby was a kinda generic main character~World wasn't introduced super well, I was confused esp. at the beginning~Some parts in the middle dragged a bitThe things that I REALLY didn't like:~Martin: Just generally a creep before he even said a word~Clancey: Just generally a creep from the first sentence his slimy face spoke.~WHAT EVEN WAS THAT ENDING MY GOODNESS I AM NOT OKAY!!!!!!!!!!(view spoiler)[WhY RUbY whY WOuLd yoU DO ThAt?!?!?! I am not emotionally equipped to deal with a Liam who doesn't remember Ruby, especially not after his uber cute speech about how fate brought them together and no circumstances can tear them apart. I'm not crying, you're crying...(hide spoiler)]
