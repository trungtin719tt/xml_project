I started my journey with the Dark Tower series on the 26th of July 2017, and now the journey is over.I am both glad and sad that I am done with the series. Glad, because the journey was too long and I needed to see the end of it. Sad, because I will miss everyone.The Dark Tower series is an epic tale of chivalry, friendship, adventure, love, and obsession. The tale grows in a very organic way with each book, and with it we see and feel the remarkable change and development of each character.In The Gunslinger, we meet Roland this unlikable man, who has been traveling on the road for years, and years, and years, seeking the Dark Tower. Roland in this volume is dry man with an empty heart. He has been journeying for a long, with nothing but his father's guns. His doesn't give a shit about anyone or anything beside the Tower.However, as the series advances, and Roland meets new people (his Ka-Tet), his life is changed forever: He becomes a man of great empathy, with a wonderful heart, and someone who could love and be loved. His character arc is without any reasonable doubt one of King's best accomplishments.And now we come to Roland's Ka-Tet (his companions on his journey to the Tower): Eddy, Susannah, Jake, and the billy-bumbler Oy. Let me tell you at once: These characters has become a family of mine on the pages and in my mind. Think about it, you spend more than a year reading and following these characters' footsteps as they face the unfathomable. As they fall in love. As they learn how to survive in this alien place. And eventually, as face their fates.Regarding the Dark Tower's world-building, this I consider is Stephen King's best accomplishment in his entire writing career. You got to go to so many great places, crafted in the most imaginative and sophisticated manner only Stephen King can achieve.Now that I spoke about the whole series, let me tell you about my thoughts about this last volume, for I have a few that I need to highlight.This book is a roller-coaster of ups and downs, though more ups than downs. The Dark Tower, though it was great, wasn't the strongest in the series--which for me that would always be The Waste Lands, book 3.It suffers from a disorientation in pacing; just when I feel like flying through, there would come a large part where the pacing would drastically suffer and slow . . . and then the fast-pacing would come back again. For example, throughout the last 100 pages, I came to a point where I just want to finish from the whole thing because I just can't take it anymore. The last 100 pages were a pain in the back since nothing epic happened . . . but that's okay, because the very, very finality of Roland's journey would make you disregard that bad part and focus on this wonderful and epic END to the series.Though many would say it wasn't that great of an ending, I would tell them FU, because it was . . . and the only Ending it would fit.Mordred and the Crimson King's parts were sadly anti-climatic . . . even Randall Flagg's. This book itself was a lonnnng journey, but that made it more epic, because we needed to feel the suffering and anticipation of our main characters on their last journey to the Tower.All these battles, deaths, murders, love, friendships, revenge, and betrayals . . . It is all for the Dark Tower (I know, I stole this line from the Game of Thrones promo for season 8 . . . but in its own way, it fits for the Dark Tower; ha-ha!).I say thank ya for reading this review. Long days and pleasant nights.
