I loved it! I remember seeing the film years ago and enjoying it so much. On a whim I decided to read the book and I was fascinated by it! What I savoured most of all was the mood and tone of the book. There's this feeling of doom, claustrophobia and being smothered that permeates everything and it made the book so exciting.The City of Ember, made by the Builders two and a half centuries ago, is slowly but surely declining. The supplies are running out and the generator powered by the river that flows under the city which in turn powers the whole city is failing. The people feel trapped but have nowhere to go. Two 12 year olds, Lina Mayfleet and Doon Harrow, find a clue left by the Builders and slowly unravel the mystery that may possibly lead to an escape from the dying city.Can't wait to read the rest of the books.
