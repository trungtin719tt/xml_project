Beautiful short story about brothers, fly fishing and Montana. I listened to the audio version on my commute, so I was transported from gridlock to the Montana mountains in the years between the World Wars. I have seen the movie, so it was easy to picture a young Brad Pitt as brother Paul. Yeah, those were peaceful commutes. :)
