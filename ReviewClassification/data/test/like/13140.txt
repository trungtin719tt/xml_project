4 Family Matters StarsSpoilersShort and sweet so I can get to the next book. Wow City of Ashes was action packed and full of teenage angst. And I loved it! I feel this book focused a lot on Simon and all the changes that happen to him. I liked seeing the character growth in this book for Clary, Jace, Simon, Alec, and Izzy. I really didn't like Maryse, I felt like she really let Jace down. Poor Jace it was like no one loved Jace. Everyone turned their back on him or let him down even Clary. All he wants is to be loved! Clary had it hard too. I understand where she was coming from. She loved Jace but can't be with him and she loves Simon like a brother but he wants more and she feels like she needs to give that to him. She really had some emotional stuff to deal with. I felt like Jace really maned up in this book. He stepped up and did some great things especially for Simon. My hate for Valentine(or as I like to call him Paranormal Hitler) grew by leaps and bounds in this book. Cassandra Clare did a great job of writing a evil,psychopathic, bigot bad guy. I flew through this book in one day. I got nothing done today but feeding my children lol. I just couldn't put it down. Great read. Now I am on to the next book and I can't wait to see what happens next!
