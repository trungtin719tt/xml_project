This is an amazing autobiography of a girl who conquered her weaknesses. Hellen Keller was a deaf blind girl who learned sign language and braille, and founded a college for the deaf blind in Washington DC. She overcome all odds with an amazing possative attitude which was partly imparted from her long suffering patient teacher.I recommend everyone reads this and gets inspired.Be Blessed.Diamond
