"A River Runs Through It" is one of the best written stories I've ever read. Nearly a third of its 105 pages are spent describing fly fishing outings in minute detail. Having never had this experience myself, I nonetheless leaned forward, spellbound, as I read. Even these details weave perfectly into the larger focus of the story, subtly showing the beautiful relationship between two brothers and their father.Two more stories remain to be read in this short collection, but I already wish Maclean had been more prolific. This is just selfishness though; one perfectly beautiful story is more than many writers accomplish in a lifetime.The second novella in this story collection, USFS 1919: The Ranger, The Cook, and a Hole in the Sky, probably isn't the masterpiece that A River Runs Through It is, but it contains some of the best written scenes I've read. A mountain hike, a bar fight, a rattlesnake attack . . . even moments of "slowish" prose are coiled to strike with brilliance at any moment, and Maclean's subtle humor even becomes a bit reckless at times, which endears me to his storytelling even further. I predict the patient reader will chuckle and "Ahh" with pleasant surprise from beginning to end.a Post Script: I stopped to read this when I arrived at Wendell Berry's essay, "Style and Grace," in the collection What Are People For. In it, Berry contrasts Maclean's fishing story to Hemingway's, "Big Two-Hearted River." The essay is an excellent critical comparison and worth reading. It should be a pretty easy guess which story wins the "Grace" prize according to Berry.
