Recently I re-read this excellent book for the third time. It is a heartwarming story for young adults of all ages relating the journeys of intriguing characters (actual journeys as well as metaphorical journeys). The characters are caring and endearing as they interact with others while dealing with mistakes they make and losses they suffer.The book contains so many delightful quotes such as:"I prayed to trees. This was easier than praying directly to God. There was nearly always a tree nearby.""Don't judge a man until you've walked two moons in his moccasins.""We have to go on with things. We can't malinger.""You can't keep the birds of sadness from flying over your head, but you can keep them from nesting in your hair."WALK TWO MOONS is one of my all-time favorites.
