3.5 starsThis book isn't a low-ish rating because it had bad things occurring, but I feel like it started out at a 3 stars at a baseline rating and just didn't do much to make it any higher of a rating. I listened to this on audio, which is different because I typically get lost when I listen to fantasy on audio, but the cast of characters in this was actually pretty easy to keep clear, the magic system was comprehensible, and the plot and subplots were paced great. However, this didn't satisfy what I crave in fantasy books, so it just didn't personally check every box I would have ideally liked.The characters in this felt a bit muddled. From character descriptions to their motivations and backstories, they felt a bit at arm's length. I didn't know any of the characters' ages and so for half the book, I mistakenly thought the love interest was 20+ years older than he actually was. Additionally, I thought the lead female character was written in a very general model of girl doesn't know she has powers/girl was abused and has to overcome her oppressors/girl is taken from jail to serve the government (*dry cough*). I didn't feel gripped at any point in this story other than the rare kissing scenes, but I did like the sprinkles of intrigue with the governments and I did enjoy listening to this just for the fun plot of it.Hopefully in future books there'll be a bigger cast of characters and we'll be able to dive into their personalities and motives and backstories instead of skimming the surface and only seeing their interactions. So really there was nothing wrong with this book, I just wanted moooore. Everything felt slightly too dry.
