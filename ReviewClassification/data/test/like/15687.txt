I kept circling this as if it were a bad tasting medicine - I don't know why I seemed to expect so little - and I was so wrong! This is an excellent read, wonderful characterisation, lots of layers within the plot, and the best romantic hero and heroine I have come across in recent times. I see this likened toGone with the Windand I have to say that is not an unreasonable comparison. Luckily, I had the sequel to hand and started it over my breakfast coffee, so have it happily in prospect when I get home. :)
