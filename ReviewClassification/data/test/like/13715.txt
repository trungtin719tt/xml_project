My friend Renee recommended this one to me, she knows I've had questions in life and I'm open to unique perspectives; what can I say, I don't know everything in life and I'm still learning. Illusions is a book of self learning or teaching by and indirect method, I'll let you decide. For me it was an indirect method learning about the illusions of life and how we limit ourselves. In this case Mr. Bach has two gentlemen who give airplane rides to people meet and we watch as one quests and learns about himself and the world. As he slowly expands his world past his narrow, limited world into understanding that the world is limitless and only we limit ourselves elite meant happens. Yes, Mr. Bach has shown us there is a world outside of the box we place ourselves in and while others can show us there's more around us, only we can go beyond our self imposed limits.This is an outstanding read! I learned so much about myself it's amazing. This is a solid 5 star book where we can learn about ourselves and if we limit ourselves from doing all that we possibly can. While the is an allegory about a persons relationship with God, you don't have to limit yourself with this viewpoint. Expand yourself, take wing, and fly beyond your limits so others are amazed and you become their teacher.
