The way John Grisham portrayed his characters and the setting of The Runaway Jury enable me to engage with the plot and his characters. The Runaway Jury is a fantastic legal drama and was well written and researched by John Grisham. At times I had to laugh with what John Grisham characters get up to in The Runaway Jury.The readers of The Runaway Jury will learn about The United States of America Jury system and procedures. Also, The Runaway Jury highlights the legal system in The United States of America for the readers.I recommend this book.
