When do we truly die ? The most logical answer would be to say that we die when the last breath escapes us and when our body and mind cease to function. But I tend to differ , death would be the loss of fascination and wonderment at the world around us. To wake up and see the sun rise everyday, to listen to birdsong in the mornings and see the blue sky above you, to feel the rain lashing at you and at times caressing you with its softness, the gentle breeze of the evenings, the feel of the sea waves beneath your toes....this is life ! And when a time arrives during which none of this can be felt with the same sense of wanton bliss, I shall call it death. If ever there arises a world like Cormac McCarthy'sThe Roadenvisaged, I would go insane in a couple of days at the most !This digression is very much in line with Carl Sagan's work for he speaks to us about our home : Earth. His voice is one of clear reason and indefatigable energy that I was filled with a sense of elation to say the least. You hold his hand and walk with him, a kid who for the first time stepped into a science class with eyes as wide and big as glass marbles ! Even when he tells you that you are nothing but an insignificant speck of dust in the order of things in the galaxy, he continues to sayBut look around you, isn't the Earth the most beautiful thing you ever saw ?Sagan conducts a virtual tour through the history of human civilizations, astronomy, the rise of science, interstellar and interplanetary travel and also ponders for a chapter on the perceived nature of extra terrestrial intelligence.What makes it marvelous reading ? One word : Simplicity ! He never writes a word that a common man needs to break his head over. Yes, there are graphical representations and equations galore in the book but even if you skip them and keep reading you will not be at a loss. Things are kept to the simplest way possible, a spade is called a spade and there are no unnecessary theatrics.I have not seen the TV series that inspired this book but am surely going to go in search of it !Recommended for those with a love for nature and science.
