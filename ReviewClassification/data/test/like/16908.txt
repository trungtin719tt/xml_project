I was surpised to realize that I completely enjoyed myself with this book. It is somewhat of a Romeo &amp; Juliet story of star-crossed lovers whose families are enemies, but with vampires.The characters are sweet, secretive, and charming at the same time. I loved Lucas throughout the entirety of the book, while it took me a little while to adjust to Bianca. However, once I did I felt that the pairing of these two characters was meant to be!I ended up being surprised twice during this book, which is exceedingly difficult for authors to do with me. It is very rare for me to be truly surprised. The fact that this author managed what very few authors do...just enhanced the book for me.I fully recommend reading this book. I read it in one day, because I simply could not put it down. I intend to begin the second book in the series tomorrow!
