Second reading: February 2017First reading: December 2014Indisputably a classic for all of the right reasons. This is an incredible adventure story that is full of famous icons and age old ideas about courtly love but it is also a fascinating social commentary and complex bit of storytelling. Sir Walter Scott provides highly entertaining content which also respects the intelligence and intellectual curiosity of its readers. Read Ivan home for the story but know that it will leave a mark on your heart and will challenge the way in which you perceive others.Sir Walter Scott challenges social ideas both of his time and the time of his setting. His caricatures of the heroes and the villains are interesting, complex and properly balanced. When the worst stereotypes of medieval Jews are shown in Isaac, they are immediately counterbalanced in the sincerity and generosity of Rebecca. Where the monastic friars are corrupt, licentious and self-serving they are counterbalanced by Christians who are sincere, faithful and gentle. We have a Black Knight who is anything but dark or evil. We have Templars who are attired in light and airy garments who are evil personified.The balancing and counterbalancing extends also to the characters themselves. In Cedric we see a brash, judgmental, harsh Lord who is also tender and loving and gracious. In Sir Brian, we see a calculating and sophisticated warrior who seeks to serve his own interests until he is bewildered by an inexplicable affection for someone he cannot have who renders him gentle, supplicant and almost worthy.I have always loved Robin Hood and the fact that he feature so prominently in this story serves me as a bit of the cherry on top of the sundae. I love sir Walter Scott's treatment of Robin Hood. He is highly organized, deeply Noble and, as the Black Knight calls him, a king in his own right.This is my second reading of the book and I spent a significant portion of my childhood watching the Anthony Andrews movie. this novel does not fail to impress. I enjoyed it, I learned from it and I am certain that I will be reading it again and again throughout my lifetime.
