Three nights ago, I could not sleep and was not in the mood to read any of the books I was then, and still am, in the middle of reading. So I decided I pluck one of the classics from the bedside bookshelf and just so happened to pick out an old favourite,Around the World in Eighty Daysby Jules Verne.When I was younger, and while most others my age were reading Harry Potter or Twilight, I would read Jules Verne, Mark Twain, Jack London, etc. And I loved them, despite only being able to understand them half of the time. Admittedly, this was probably what has made me somewhat of a book snob. But it is one of the many reasons why I love classics so much.Therefore, it was a thrill to be able to read this beloved book again. Although I do remember20, 000 Leagues Under the Seabeing my favourite, so now I will have to re-read that too.It was actually even better than I remember. Perhaps because I can understand the big words more now that I am older... From the beginning, I was hooked.Verne's style is as matter of fact as his famous character, Phileas Fogg. But it is also witty and charming and absolutely clever. Verne was a genius. A man who was so far ahead of his time, it's outstanding.I honestly cannot find a single flaw in this book. Perhaps I am blinded by sentiment and nostalgia. But besides that, this is still a very good book. What an excellent start to the year!
