After reading Last Exit to Brooklyn, I thought that I had seen the worst of Selby's characters. As I tensely awaited the conclusion of each chapter, hoping that maybe just one of the characters would manage to get ahead or break the cycle of dependency on drugs, I would be rendered speechless by the desperation and insanity brought on by addiction. As the darkness of winter descends upon Brooklyn, Harry, Tyrone &amp; Marion all find themselves stumbling through the night to get their next fix, ,addiction controlling their every waking moment now. In an equally hopeless spiral, is Harry's mother, Sara Goldfarb. Preoccupied with thoughts of her dead husband and absent son, the TV pacifies the raging loneliness and depression that she feels. A routine call from a telemarketer prophesies false hope that she will be a contestant on a game show. In an attempt to lose weight before her TV appearance, Sara begins a long, hallucinatory journey to drug addiction by consuming diet pills. Before long, she is having conversations with her refrigerator and the TV. There is no light at the end of the tunnel with this story. Sadly, many of Selby's characters are self-destructive and trapped in circumstances that render them helpless or give them no reason to persevere. Perhaps the reason that Selby has not been more widely accepted by the public is due to the bleak condition he leaves his readers in, gasping for air, for a happy ending, for some sign of redemption-surely the human condition can't be this bad? We all cheer for the character that manages to overcome obstacles and bad circumstances in a single bound, but Selby explores the weakness of the human condition and the tendency to fall down and not get up again.
