The first time I met Mowgli was when I was very small. I must have been only around two years old and I had watched the Disney film. I HATED it. But when I realized that it was based off of a book (when I was around five or six) I immediately went to the library and checked out both Jungle Books. It was then that I fell in love.Kipling is very problematic racially and politically. Throughout these books it is easy to pick up on Kipling's inherent prejudice. Through Mowgli the reader is introduced to a "superstitious" and often "savage" race of people.In spite of Kipling's racism this is still one of my favorite book series. Mowgli, his friends, and his adventures still make me smile, cringe, and cry (especially at certain character deaths). The Jungle Books is something that can be enjoyed by anyone whether they are adults or children. I'd recommend these books to anyone who loves an adventure and characters who, while flawed and occasionally severe, get right up inside you and live there for years to come.
