Myths are often stories that explain how the world and human kind came to be in their present form. I have always been inexplicable drawn to these stories and often felt that they have a quality beyond what they seem to be. The undeniable pull of myths have in the human psyche and the society that surrounds them are often met with scrutiny and criticism. When you say that you are interested in mythology the question naturally comes as to why this particular subject is of interest? What role does myth have to play in our modern world? Why is it important?. Whenever questions like this were directed at me I was often placed in a situation where I know what drives me towards myth but was at loss when it came to explaining this same driving factor. But that was until I read this book which gave me valuable insights in to the world of myth and urged me to consider those dimension of mythical aspects which I was completely ignorant off."The Power of Myth" is based on the interviews between Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers that became a famous television series. Consisting of nine chapters that explain the importance of myth in various aspects, it deals with the universality and evolution of myths in the history of the human race and the place of myths in modern society. The first chapter is on myth and modern world which tries to explain myth as an integral part of the society and the transition required in the myths to make it more adaptable to present day world. He talks about reasons for forgoing old mythological motifs and using them to create new global mythologies that is more acceptable to the modern psyche. The role of rituals in the modern society starting from the court room procedures to the gang initiations of adolescents is emphasized to such an extent that they can be viewed as functions to give individuals a sense of belonging to a larger social group. Then the discussion moves to the concept of marriage. True marriage, in Campbell's opinion, embodies a spiritual identity and invokes the image of an incarnate God. The main intention of marriage is to identify ones other self and thereby become whole. The analysis of the national symbol of united states "The Great Seal" is used by Campbell to illustrate the ability for myths to incorporate the beliefs of a whole society and to provide the mythology to unify a nation. He ends this discussion with the possibility of the emergence a new myth which is centered around mother earth or Gaea. The second chapter takes about the Journey inward to ones spiritual self and how myths help you achieve this end. Then comes the story of the first storytellers, the animal self, the cycle of life and death, the center of the world and rituals associated with these concepts in various part of the world. The next chapter explains the shift of the society towards an agricultural society and the change in myth motifs according to these changing perspectives. The following chapters talks about a hero's journey which contains some of the major aspects pointed out in Campbell's previous books, the change of society from a goddess centric female dominated society into a male dominated society and their reemergence in the 12th and 13th century, tales of love and marriage and masks of eternity that identifies with infinity and the power of circle as a symbol. Needless to say this book contains a wealth of information that changes your perspective of the human spirit and its capabilities. There are only very few books that can transform your entire thought process and "The Power of Myth" is definitely such a book for me.
