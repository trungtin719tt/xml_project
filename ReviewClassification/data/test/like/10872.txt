This is my sixth journey into the fantastical lands of Narnia, as I have chosen to read the series in chronological rather than publication order.Eustace Stubb and Jill Pole manage to escape the bullies of their own world and enter into the fantastical lands of Narnia. Borne on a lion's breath they descend and discover that the lands are once again in turmoil. Young Prince Rilian is missing and old King Caspian is on his death bed, with no heir to precede him. It is up to the duo, along with the help of Puddleglum the Marsh-wiggle, to traverse the strange country, find the missing heir and save Narnia for the doom that could otherwise befall it.Like the other instalments in this series, there was a moralistic and overtly religious edge to the text that jarred with me, as a contemporary reader. That being said, it did not hamper my overall enjoyment of this fantastical and magical tale.The characters were as lovable as always and the journey as transporting and enchanting. Puddleglum's character made for especially charming reading, as his pessimistic disposition managed to instil the opposite emotion in the reader and made this humorous and delightful.There is a simplicity and goodness to these stories, where good can be relied upon to overcome evil and justice is always served. With only one more tale left in the series, I will be sad to say goodbye to this world.
