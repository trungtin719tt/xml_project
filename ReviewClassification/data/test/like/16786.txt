2011:The third installment of my very favorite fairy and steampunk series featuring my favorite cat ever and the cutest Gremlin alive ... I lovedThe Iron Kingand just likedThe Iron Daughter. The typical consequence following the law of paranormal trilogies would be that I toleratedThe Iron Queen- for old times' sake. But no - I got to be surprised (although I sometimes feel so unsurprisable): In most parts I likedThe Iron Queenalmost as much asThe Iron Kingand in some parts (i.e. the number of Grimalkin dialogues, the multiple, fantastic steampunk elements, the Puck-and-Ash-banter and Meghan's personal growth) I think it even surpassed it in my eyes.Before readingThe Iron Queenmy guess aboutThe Iron Knight/Ash's story was that we would be told some ancient story about his former self wooing Ariella or losing his soul or growing a heart or battling his brothers, but now I am pretty positive thatJulie Kagawais going to treat us with a narration of what happens afterThe Iron Queen- in Ash's point of view. I cross my fingers that I am right. Therehasto be a way.And please, Mrs. Kagawa, write some awsome new series on the side, won't you? I bet it will relax you in the evenings after hours of tweaking Ash's musings and Puck's teasings.Ohhh ... and I forgot: TBR Pile Reduction Challenge 2011, Book #8 (challenger = Jessica)
