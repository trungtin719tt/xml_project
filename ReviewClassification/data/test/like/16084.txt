I truly enjoyed this book - which is no surprise considering my soft spot for fairy tales! I love a good fractured fairy tale, and this was no exception. The character development was wonderful. At the beginning of the story, I truly hated the main character and felt he definitely deserved to be turned into a beast! But I did change my feelings as his actions and thoughts took a turn for the better.I highly recommend this modern day version of 'Beauty and the Beast.'
