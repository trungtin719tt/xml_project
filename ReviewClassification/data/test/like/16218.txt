HumiliationThere are a couple of challenging topics in J.M. Coetzee's bookDisgrace. The main protagonist, David Lurie, bitterly resigns his academic position at the Univerity of Cape Town after an affair with a student. The relationship issue of teacher-student ethics is confronted when David refuses to apologise publicly for what he saw as a consensual adult relationship. What goes deeper than this misjudged affair, is David's perspective on women, and with 2 failed marriages behind him, it reveals his disrespectful and disconnected attitude towards females. Coetzee is just a marvel at how he creates a character with multiple traits that are set to disappoint, surprise and resonate.David then moves to his daughter Lucy's farm, in remote South Africa during the political changes with the black population transitioning into control. During the initial period, there is a hope that David starts to rectify his behaviour and outlook on women and life. The relationship with his daughter seems to be improving from previous encounters. Life isn't going to be that simple and as a white landowner, they are attacked on their land and racial issues and personal tensions are brought to the boil again. Old problems regarding the father-daughter relationship come through and place considerable stress on the home.The writing is wonderful as it stirs emotions, some not very pleasant, which are disagreeable and difficult to come to terms with. This is a deep look into a character and his interactions with women, and it explores the powerful prejudices some people hold.The imagery of South Africa is excellent and the atmosphere during that period is wonderfully drawn. I would recommend this book.
