The family is the glue that holds human civilization together. In PRODIGAL SUMMER, Kingsolver demonstrates that the foundations of the earth are also the foundations of the family, that there is no "human" without "nature." As Nannie Rawley says, "Everything alive is connected to every other by fine, invisible threads." A human community is just another kind of ecosystem, supported, nourished, and made possible by the natural world. The novel follows three different people through their three different experiences of the prodigal summer of Zebulon County, but at every turn, the reader is given a nudge and a wink in the secret understanding that these different lives are really interwoven in a myriad of small and large ways, with each other and with nature.Deanna Wolfe, living in the solitary idyll of a Forest Service cabin on Zebulon Mountain, young widow Lusa Landowski, searching for high ground amidst the flood of her grief on her late husband's farm in Zebulon Valley, and octogenarian Garnett S. Walker III, on a mission from God to re-establish the all but extinct American chestnut tree over there on Highway 6, are all depending on the same wild mountain and domesticated valley for their pasts, presents, and futures. And in this prodigal summer, natural abundance is everywhere to be seen. I am the kind of person whose mind usually wanders when faced with descriptions of natural surroundings, but Kingsolver's deep feelings for the natural world show in her simple but beautiful similes and metaphors of nature, which captured my recalcitrant mind utterly. Kingsolver offers the reader swallows like little fighter jets; a pond laminated in gold leaf by the sunset; moths like visible molecules, entirely filling up space with their looping trajectories; and a night in which "the moon's reflection hung dead-center in the pond, a white, trembling promise as old as night."PRODIGAL SUMMER opens with Deanna's musings on the fast-approaching summer and breeding season - "even the air smelled of sexual ecstasy" - while Lusa has never seen "such an oversexed, muggy summer." Even upright, God-fearing Mr. Garnett Walker can't help but admire his cantankerous neighbor's legs even while condemning her wearing of "short pants" as "indecent exposure." The natural environment of Zebulon County has set the scene for a summer of life-changing proportions. The three stories are all touched by benign ghosts, petty prejudices, and the claims staked by names - all very human concerns that nature has the potential to harm or heal.Ghosts, both seen and unseen, proliferate throughout each of the three story lines. Deanna lives her outdoor life surrounded by the ghosts of extinct species as well as her failed marriage. Wolfe by name as well as by nature, she feels most keenly the absence of the red wolf that once topped the food chain on Zebulon Mountain, and when she finds evidence that a family of coyotes has come to take the place of their canid cousins, Deanna's dearest wish is that she could share the news with her late father. Lusa communes not only with the ghost of her recently deceased husband but also with the former occupants of the farmhouse he left her and the ghosts of her own farming ancestors, who give her strength to move forward, thanks to "certain kinds of love you can't see." And Garnett still lives with the ghost of his wife, Ellen, eight years gone but ever-present. Garnett has other ghosts, too - his ancestors founded Zebulon County on the back of the American chestnut tree, until the whole empire came crashing down in the great chestnut blight of 1904. Now Garnett is desperately trying to breed a blight-resistant strain of chestnut in order to lay his "arboreal ghosts" to rest.PRODIGAL SUMMER is driven to a large extent by the entirely human concept of prejudice, which often makes humanity seem unworthy of its privileged place above the supposedly less evolved creatures of nature. When Deanna first encounters Eddie, the coyote hunter who will tumble her head over heels in this erotically charged summer and challenge her in almost every conceivable way, she watches him go through the mental adjustment Yankees always do when they realize they've encountered a Southerner who is educated and smart. In an increasingly serious way, she will also have to continually confront the fact that this son of sheep ranchers cannot see the coyote as anything but the enemy. Lusa's family and the family she has married into each seem implacable in their belief that the other is a "family of fools," and Lusa despairs of ever finding any common ground with her five new sisters-in-law. However, when Lusa's scientific expertise in all things bug-related helps her to connect with another of the family's outcasts, she begins to realize that her own prejudices against these five women may be just as unfair as are theirs against her. And then there is Garnett, whose life seems to be sustained in large part by his ongoing feud with his neighbor, chemical-hating, certified organic orchardist Nannie Rawley. As far as Garnett is concerned, "Success without chemicals was impossible. Nannie Rawley was a deluded old harpy in pigtails." Yet if Garnett can find it in his devoutly Christian heart to overcome his prejudice, his eyes may be opened to more than one new possibility.Names and naming also seem important throughout these stories. Deanna is reluctant to tell Eddie her name, as if it would be giving too much of herself to this wily, beguiling stranger. Lusa is offended that her in-laws avoid using her name and never even learn all of it, while people gossip about Lusa returning so soon to her maiden name when in fact she had never left it at all. She also uses mnemonics to remember all her sisters-in-law's names, and loves reciting the Latin names of moths as a way of calming the turmoil in her soul. Garnett is proud of his forebears naming Zebulon Mountain and Valley and is proud that people used to call it Walker Mountain and Valley. Above all, Garnett wants to breed his blight-resistant chestnut so that he can name it the "Walker American chestnut."And through all of these very human and occasionally very animal stories, the "fine, invisible threads" that weave them together are carried by the ghostly, golden forms of the coyotes that have come to stay, whether for a while or for good. As Deanna explains at the beginning of PRODIGAL SUMMER, and as Kingsolver carefully reaffirms throughout, predators are of the greatest importance to ecosystems because they keep everything in balance - or in the stories of Deanna, Lusa, and Garnett, they return lives to balance, sort out what is most important, and tie everything together. They also represent the greatest strengths of each character: wildness, adaptability, endurance. And they remind the reader of the ageless law of nature, a law so fundamental that it applies also to humanity, including the three main protagonists of PRODIGAL SUMMER: "The world was what it was, a place with its own rules of hunger and satisfaction. Creatures lived, and mated, and died; they came and went, as surely as summer did. They would go their own ways, of their own accord."For me, reading PRODIGAL SUMMER was a joy from start to finish. Anyone with any regard for nature and for the fears and eccentricities that make people all too human will surely find something to love here. Kingsolver is an expert at pushing the "too much information" boundary without actually crossing it, and I learned a lot without ever once feeling like I was in a schoolroom. The greatest strength of this novel, however, is the depth to be found in its characters, all of whom I warmed to virtually immediately. Lusa is likely to appeal the most to readers, yet I am pleasantly surprised to say that my favorite character from PRODIGAL SUMMER is that eighty-year-old grouch, Garnett Walker. He may be a self-righteous pedant, but he is eminently lovable and provides numerous moments of laugh-aloud levity. This old fusspot who has to go and lie down after encountering an answering machine - after all, they beep at you and expect you to speak your whole mind on the spot without even warming up to it first - was bound to win my heart.
