this is one of those books my mother has been telling me to read for what feels like my whole life. the opening sentence, about jesus' disciples being fly fisherman and john, the favorite, being a dry-fly fisherman, was quoted and referred to on the screen porch in the afternoon, at the dinner table in the evening, and in the morning on the way to church. naturally, i have fought reading it tooth and nail.but mama was right. it is unbelievable. the title story is beautiful and heartbreaking, and the writing itself has the controlled and confident power that maclean describes in his brother's cast. maclean wrote this barely-fictional story of life as a child and young man when he was in his 70s; its concentrated grace is a forceful argument in favor of patience in writing, of telling no tale before its time.
