A glimpse into Hell by one of my favorite authors, who I hadn't read in at least a decade. For as brutal as Selby's stories are, he writes from a place of deep empathy, love, and strong morality, and that's what makes his novels hit so hard. You can feel his heart breaking for the characters who inhabit the worlds he creates, which, sadly, closely reflect our own, whether you see it or not.
