Gosh, I want to hate her for writing books like this...Throughout the whole book, I was thinking about what rating to give it, because there were parts that blew my mind and others that were just very slow, yet significant for the storyline. I even caught myself thinking: "Ha, she forgot to mention that" but then it happens on the last page. ;)The end of "The Pact" convinced me again though that I can't give this book less than 5 stars. There aren't many books where I really sympathise or feel with the characters. For the time I'm reading the book, they are really part of my life and this is kind of frightening.The ending was really unexpected for me. Well, not the actual revelation, but how it turned out in the end. Jodi Picoult never ceases to amaze me. Wow.
