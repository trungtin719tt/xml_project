A disturbing and gruesome epistolary novel that is not an easy read. It's like one of those horror movies where you know there is a monster with a BIG AX behind the door and still the actor moves forward. I kept thinking, NO! DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER BABY, DO NOT BUY A PET, AND FOR HEAVENS SAKE,DO NOT LET KEVIN BABYSIT!Not sure if I would recommend this book as it is NOT an enjoyable read or a book I would read again, but despite the sometimes drawn out 400 pages, I just had to keep reading to find out how it all ended, and OMG! WHAT AN ENDING!Update: January 9, 2016Holy Crap! Just watched the movie. Many differences(including the ending)from what I recall from the book, but still super creepy and disturbing. Ewwwww......Kevin!!!
