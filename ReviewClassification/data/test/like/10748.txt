Update 12/22/2014I still think it's agreat story and I still think the first part needed some trimming - too much recapping and too much horny angst.NO SPOILERS(I wouldn't do this to you) *But there might be some in comments*OMG! What an exciting ride it has been! And how satisfying! So much depended on the quality of this last installment and, thank goodness, Moning didn't disappoint.Shadowfeveris not one of those series finales that you want to forget ever reading. Quite the opposite. There is a lot to be said about benefits of series' outlining. I strongly believe that a series with no pre-planning has almost no chance of succeeding. We are lucky Moning knows her stuff.This last installment is a twisty tale, with so many revelations and surprises, your head will spin. After speculating for months who was who or what and what everyone's motives were, I have to admit, I guessed correctly almost none of it. It takes talent to write an ending that is so satisfying and with the outcome we all wanted, and make it so exciting and unpredictable until the very last page.Shadowfeveris not a flawless book. Some vital revelations were not foreshadowed properly. I also found the 1st part of the book a little hard to connect with. It gave me painful flashbacks of being in Katniss' head inMockingjay(I love that book by the way). But the moment the 2nd part begins, oh my, there is no stopping that train! I ended up staying up most of last night telling myself - just one more chapter... And the flaws? Well, even though there is plenty of them, the final result is still deliciously satisfying.I feel exhilarated and uplifted after finishingShadowfever. Do not worry, it ends well, even though the path to HEA is a thorny and angsty one. Yes, the series became darker and darker over time, but Moning wasn't lying assuring us thatFeverseries was about light and not darkness. Indeed it is.Shadowfeveris about light, about survival and, of course, love. Love makes appearance in many unexpected forms in this novel.I also have to give Moning a special credit the fae world she had created. It is by far the most creative, complex and convoluted (in a good way) take on fae mythology I have ever encountered.And of course there is that VERY IMPORTANT part of the series we all can't get enough of. I don't think there are many fantasy hunks out there who could rival Jericho Barrons. He is the one very-very bad guy who you simultaneously want to run away from and do bad-bad things to him behind the bookshelves in BB&amp;B... Goodness, I feel hot flashes just thinking about him!I look forward to readingFeverbooks again and again in all their sexy, violent, intriguing glory. And there are moreFeveruniverse books on the way. Isn't that great?
