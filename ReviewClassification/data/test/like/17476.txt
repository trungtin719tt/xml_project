One of my trusty goodreads friend's recently recommended Robert McCammon to me and I am so grateful she did (thanks Jennifer!). I will be honest though that when I read "Boy's Life" that I zoned out at times because it seemed to become too wordy at times but I didn't find that to be an issue at all with Swan Song. Wow! Robert McCammon is truly a very talented storyteller and I was immediately wrapped up in this dystopian story of survival after a nuclear holocaust.Most people, including myself, feel that long books can be a drag especially for those who have a shorter attention span but with Swan Song, I enjoyed it so much that I viewed it as a series all wrapped up into one book so that I wouldn't have to wait for the next one! The writing is superb and the characters are so well-developed that I felt that I really knew them and still do. I am ultimately sad that that book ended.I highly recommend this book!
