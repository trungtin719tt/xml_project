I struggled with whether I wanted to give this book 4 stars or 5 stars for a solid couple of hours. I think if I were to rateBrave New Worldon its own, I would probably go with 4 stars. The story is incredibly ambitious and has a lot going for it, but I really think the early chapters drag. I find Bernard to be an almost intolerable character to spend time with, and its not until John is introduced that I really become invested in the world and the story. John is, quite clearly, a twisted sort of stand-in for the reader, and it is through his perspective that I think the themes Huxley is exploring really pop off the page.What really pushed me to give 5 stars here is the second half of this book,Brave New World Revisited. I can not stress enough how interesting and delightful it was to explore the mind of Huxley and his musings on the current state of the world in the '50s in regards to the totalitarian "utopia" he dreamed up back whenBrave New Worldwas originally published. If you have ever readBrave New Worldor if you ever plan on reading it I cannot stress enough how important I think it is to give Revisited a read through also, as it both enriches the experience ofBrave New Worldas well as providing an incredibly engaging exploration of society and the problems we face.
