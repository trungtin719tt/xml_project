Re-reading it for a class I'm taking, I was surprised to see that it's not the hoary, near-cliched, armchair statesman-like story I'd snored through in high school.It's actually a taut, crackling, suspenseful political thriller which is more compelling, dire, complex, and profound than I'd originally noticed.It's about revolution, revolutionaries, and the price one pays for irrigating the tree of liberty with the blood of tyrants. You get the restless, brittle, inferiority complex of Cassius, he of the "lean and hungry look"- sort of a cross between maybe Lenin and one of the lesser lights in Dostoevsky's possessed "Demons"; you get the stoic (not with a capital "S"), noble, rational, idealistic, practical, pragmatic, steady-as-she-goes Brutus, whose integrity and manly fortitude is challenged not only by his co-conspirators but his family and employees, and- ultimately- himself; you get pompous, regal Ceaser who doesn't know when to call it in on the Ides of March; brutal, charismatic, eloquent Marc Antony, who cleans house like nobody's buisness.It's not with a smile that I remark that Julius Ceasar seems to be one of those texts which seems to evidence that modern revolutions eat their young, but I was struck by how the drama of ideas, of breakable characters, plays out so vividly here. One of the spuerficial lessons we might learn is that if you are going to do violence in the name of liberty, patriotism or Reason itself you must make sure you have your emotional, physical, and ideological ducks in a row. Too often the grand sweep of incisive engagement means that the goal is ultiamtely won, success is at hand, but the fallout means sectarianism, opportunism, clashing egos turning to clashing swords turning to mingled pools of blood and friend's corpses littering the smoking ground.I don't think J.C is ultimately a reactionary text at all- it's quite interesting and important to see that evne though Brutus' forces are thwarted on the battlefield, and he's met a sad death by his own hand, hoisted on the petard as it were, the finale is one of legitimate grievance (from Octavius and Antony, his fresh enemies, no less!) for one who (in his way) loved not wisely but too well....
