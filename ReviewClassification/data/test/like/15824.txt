Edit:This is how I imagine Tuckerhttp://irresistiblereads.blogspot.com...Favourite Quote:"He seems to gaze right into me, like he's seeing me for who I truly am. And in that moment, I want to tell him the truth. Crazy, I know. Stupid. Wrong. I try to take a step back, but my foot slips and I almost go headfirst into the river but he catches me."Wow! Surprisingly I loved it! I have been having a bad run with angel books lately. But this is exactly what I have been looking for. Unearthly has an original plot, interesting characters, swoon worthy crush and overall is a pleasure to read.Cynthia Hand's writing was just easy to read. Before I knew it I had read 300 pages. The plot wasn't filled with action but rather mystery. Never did venture down the predictable path.This is probably the most interesting angel concept I have read. There was a little bit of good angel vs fallen angel but for a change it didn't have anything to do with the love interests. The vision and purpose element is what made this so different. Sometimes with angel concepts the history can be complex and hard to understand but this was effortless to follow.Now to my favourite part of this book, the characters and that is what drives this story. Clara is sweet, sometimes funny, believable and made smart choices. Tucker (~swoons~, sorry but every time he is mentioned that happens) is a crush worthy male character. A true gentleman, witty, gorgeous, and a cowboy (~swoons again~ sorry I am in lurve again). I adored the playful banter aka flirting between Clara and Tucker (~swoons~), it provided plenty of awwww moments. Christian, well he was okay. At first I thought I knew his type - typical, popular, gorgeous, nice guy that every girl is crushing on but in the end was more than I expected.I know that I have just mentioned two guys so therefore it equals love triangle but do not fear. This love triangle was subtle (although I do think that it might be brewing for the next book). Clara is pretty certain of her choice and doesn't go back and forth.The ending, no cliffhanger here, yay! There are a few questions but it ends in the right place for more but still leaving readers satisfied.Overall, I highly recommend this book, it had all the right elements. An outstanding debut.Thanks to Netgalley and HarperTeen for providing me with a copy. I have already pre-ordered my own copy.
