THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSI think I read chapter 55, like 100 times. Warner and Juliette finally got together (It's about time). Reading this book made me fall in love with Warner all over again. The compassion and care he has for Juliette is truly astounding. I was extremely disappointed with the ending of this book as I think Tahereh got lazy in the last 20 chapters and just rushed everything! (Or she got annoyed with my constant emails asking for the book to be released) The death of Anderson went way too quickly and she could have included a twist there! I didnt like Adam at all in this book, he annoyed me beyond belief. My favourite characters were Warner (OF COURSE), Kenji and Sonya and Sara. I was also disappointed that Kenji didn't get with either Sonya and Sara (as I said the ending was brief). Juliette certainly took her sweet time deciding if she loved Warner or not and that certainly annoyed me but thank God we got there in the end. I'm very sad the series is over but I look foward to reading more from this author as although she rushed the end she is a very descriptive and talented writer. Hats off to you Tahereh Mafi
