So much drama and heartbreak this time around!In book 4/7 of the Night Huntress series, Cat is pursued by an egotistical asshole vampire - in her dreams. Gregor is a dreamsnatcher, meaning he can transport people to his side while they are sleeping. He goes after Cat, who he claims is his wife. Another full-out vampire war breaks out - haven't we been here before? Makes me wonder how anyone under Bones' line has survived since Cat showed up.I had lots of fun reading this; like I said, it was dramatic and heavy, but it didn't bring me down. Vlad and Spade are major characters this time, which made me happy since they're two of my favorites. I also can't wait to read more about Marie, the badass voodoo ghoul queen of New Orleans.One thing that did make me blue:(view spoiler)[ Rodney's death! *sob*(hide spoiler)]
