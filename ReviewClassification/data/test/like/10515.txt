I haven't read extensively on these kind of handbooks, but as other reviews mention, this book is somewhat like wikipedia in its entries regarding different myths/classical works.However, I found the writing to be exceptional. The pace is always fast and it never feels dull to read page after page. Having the sources from where the myths are taken from is also really good as it allows you to continue reading on your own: Ovid, Apollodorus, Aeschylus, Sophocles, Homer, Virgil, etc. The book is no substitute to the body of work from classical authors but it gives an excellent rundown and weaves different myths and characters in a way that is easy to follow and understand. This will make your life easier when reading the Oresteia for example where you might want to know why the house of Atreus is followed by misfortune.In short, an excellent starting point for your immersion in the classical world!
