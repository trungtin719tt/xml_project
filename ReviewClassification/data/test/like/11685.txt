Finally managed to finish this; I think having a reading space quiet enough helped. Here, Hawking talks about such things as the beginning of time, black holes, string theories, dimensions, wormholes and time-travel - things of the universe, and where things are going. There is no Carl Sagan introduction in my version, but there are some newer things included that weren't in the original but have been 'found' since then, like a flavor of quark (top), and new findings in string theory, which are easy to notice because of the time mentioned.(what's with God popping up here and there? 8) )Throughout there are some helpful figure-pictures, though some would benefit for being made a bit sharper (more readable). And at the end there is glossary plus three short biographies (Einstein, Newton, Galilei - learned something new things about each in there).This has been a huge seller of a book, and I can see why. It is said in pretty understandable language for many average person's to understand, though no doubt some of it might go over one's head, at least for someone of average intelligence-level, like me (haha). But I feel that I got more out of it than when I first started it (leaving it unfinished until this moment).Some of it reminded me on the "Interstellar" movie (I liked it, so...), and I feel like watching it again. I did learn many interesting things from my reading, let some whoosh over my head, and consider this a good reading adventure.
