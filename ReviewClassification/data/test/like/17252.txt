2016: I always love meeting George Macdonald again. This serious fantasy abounds in humor and understanding of human nature.2014: In this brief and beautiful allegory, Lewis takes us on a tour of heaven and hell, where we learn about our powers to choose between self and salvation.This was a great book to read in conjunction with Milton'sParadise Lost.2013: also a great book to lay alongside Dante'sDivine Comedy.
