This was a fun read.I'm not sure where I got the idea, but I was under the impression that this was a series with American Gods. The only connection is that Anansi makes an appearance in American Gods, but the books have nothing to do with each other. And on that note, I will admit that I was a little apprehensive about this one because American Gods was just so-so for me. Well, Anansi Boys made up for it because this was a thoroughly enjoyable read.With a Father who wears yellow gloves, a green fedora, sings karaoke, and, oh yeah, is a God, Fat Charlie Anasi shares the loss of his father with his newly discovered brother, Spider. Together, with their inherited gifts, they journey through a labyrinth of mythological beasts, psychotic bosses and Mother-in-laws.There have been some Gaiman books along the way of my reading path that left me disappointed, but this is one of those with a writing mastery that keeps me coming back. This is one of those that I could honestly recommend to anyone.
