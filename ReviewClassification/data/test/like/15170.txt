I haven't read this in a couple years, but I remember thinking it was my favorite since book 4,Dead to the World. Eric is in it more too. If I'm remembering correctly, there's a lot more action and excitement. There's more Quinn in this one and Sookie meets another telepath, Barry the Bellboy.At the end of this one is a fantastic scene involving one of the Queen's children, Sookie, and Eric. Sookie's bond with Eric grows at the end because(view spoiler)[there is another blood exchange(hide spoiler)]. That might have been my favorite scene in this one. Once again, the Eric scenes are the best.
