I was walking through a bookstore with my cousin who is 5 years younger than me when we came across a display of The Stinky Cheese Man. She exclaimed, "Didn't you just love this book as a kid?!" I had to admit that I hadn't heard of it before, which I was a bit embarrassed about, since she was so enthusiastic and adamant that it was a must read as a kid. I checked the copyright and found that about the time this was published, I was just starting high school. Mystery solved! I'm now an adult and can read whatever I want, without embarrassment, so I checked out a copy at my local library.I have read books illustrated and written by Lane Smith, so artistically and structurally, I knew I was in for a treat. The nonsensical nature of the stories, along with the clever art direction has made this book a "new" classic for me! I laughed aloud, admired the pictures and just generally appreciated that their are such talented, clever and silly authors creating books for kids!
