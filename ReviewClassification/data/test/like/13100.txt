We, the Sisterhood, hereby instate the following rules to govern the use of the Traveling Pants.1.) You must never wash the Pants.2.) You must never double-cuff the Pants. It's tacky. There will never be a time when this will not be tacky.3.) You must never say the word "phat" while wearing the Pants. You must also never think "I am fat" while wearing the Pants...So begins the first summer apart for four friends: Lena, who is going to visit her grandparents in Greece with her sister; Carmen, heading south to see her father; Bridget, going to a soccer camp in Mexico; and Tibbie, the only one of the four to be stuck at home with a summer job. In order to feel a bit closer despite the distance, the friends find a pair of pants they profess to be "magical" -- it fits all four of them perfectly -- and form a "Sisterhood" around the pants. They are mailed back and forth from girl to girl as needed; they are all wearing the pants during a significant moment of theirs from that summer.Lena bonds with her grandparents and learns that not every guy who is attracted to her is shallow. Carmen finds out that her father is living with his fiancee and her two children, and must cope with the shock and find a way to fit in. Bridget crushes on a coach from the soccer camp, and finds the forbidden relationship yet another challenge. Tibbie meets a younger girl who, despite her young age, teaches Tibbie that there is more to a person than outward appearance.Ann Brashares has written four Sisterhood books, this being the first in the series. It is definitely a must-read for teen girls.
