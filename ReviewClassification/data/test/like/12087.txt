Since I've been reading a lot of detective-type urban fantasy lately, I decided to pick up one of the original texts of the genre, just to see what it was like.Chandler wrote this back in 1939, and the book itself holds up remarkably well even though it's been 70 years.It's very readable. Some of the slang is a little opaque, sure, but not nearly as much as you'd think.And some of the intuitive leaps Philip Marlow takes are a little difficult to grasp. But I'm not sure if that's because1) the cultural gap between now and the time the novels were written.2) the fact that it was assumed that a reader then should be willing to work a little harder back then.3) The fact that this was Chandler's first novel.Most interesting to me were the parts of the novel that didn't have anything to do with the story itself. Marlowe constantly laments how corrupt society and the government are, and I'd always thought of that as a relatively modern sensibility.And the racism and sexism in the book are moderately rampant. Marlow slaps a dame a couple times to bring her to her senses. And there's talk openly demonizing queers and fags.All of it is so matter-of-fact, it's almost inoffensive. Like when your old grampa who fought in world war two talks about the Japs and counts things "Eenie Meenie Minie Mo. Catch a Nigger by the toe." He's not being malicious, he was just brought up in a different time. And he doesn't have anything against the Japs....Reading this now, I see how so many people have been following in Chandler's footsteps. Many of the tropes were obviously set down by him, and they carry forward to this day.All it all, a worthwhile read. But probably more informative that straight-up enjoyable.
