She made a bad monster, and a worst human.Fire's world is full of monsters. They are similar to regular animals only morebeautiful and dangerous than any other creature.Theirpelts are mesmerizing- rich hues of midnight blues or forest greens or sunset oranges.That combined with theirnearly psychic powersallow for monsters entrance lure their prey to their untimely deaths.It's hard to wake from a nightmare when the nightmare is real.Fire is one of those monsters but she's far more deadly,she's a human monster.Her hair contains the most beautiful shades of reds, auburn and magenta, herbeauty is beyond renownedand her mind can ensnare all but the strongest willed humans.But.She doesn't want this.She hates howher beauty entrances even herself,how her best friend has grown possessive over her littlest gesture and how despite all she can do, she's constantly shuffled off to the side.When a mysteriously empty-headed archerattempts an assassination, Fire soon finds herself en route to the king in the company of a very distrustful prince and his guard.For the first time, she's alone -will she break free of convention or be stuck hiding inside herself forever?Absolutely loved thispseudo sequel/prequel/companion novelto Gracling.It has some elements from the first book (namely, the Big Bad evil Gracling - the one that controls minds through the sound of his voice) but this novel is set in a completely different country and set several decades before Graceling.Normally, I'm a bit bitter when book two contains no principle characters of book one but I am definitely making an exception in this case.Really enjoyed it!It was a hurting tune, resigned, a cry of heartache for all in the world that fell apart. As ash rose black against the brilliant sky, Fire's fiddle cried out for the dead, and for the living who stay behind to say goodbye.Audiobook CommentsThe reading was really well done. It wasn't a full production like book one, but the reader did a great job of characterization and tone.The 2018 ABC Reading Challenge - FBlog|Instagram|Twitter
