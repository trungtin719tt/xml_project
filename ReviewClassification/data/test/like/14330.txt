4.5 stars. (Edit: actually, sod it, I'm giving it 5 stars.)This is my first book by Lehane and I'm very impressed. Once again, I got into it thinking it'd be a fast, fun romp, with the odd clever twist here and there, but nothing unpredictable. I even thought I knew the ending before the twist was revealed, and I thought this would bore me. I was wrong on two counts. The ending surprised me - I did NOT see that coming - and even when I thought I knew the ending, the road towards the revelation was very intriguing.Lehane is extremely good at characterization, and that set this book apart from all the other airport thrillers. Even though there were so many characters to keep up with, I had them all in my head, clear as they can be, each with their own unique voice and memorable back story. Much like Stephen King, Lehane's characters are not likable people, but likable characters. Some of them are far from salvation. Some of them can't catch a break (Dave, the poor sod). I love the two wives of Dave and Jimmy, Celeste and Annabeth - the seem to be the opposite of each other, yet such good cousins. At the end, it's very revealing of Annabeth's character to see how quickly she dismissed Celeste just because they react to tragedy in different ways. Her quick acceptance of her husband's crimes made me uncomfortable.Lehane writes a lot of things that I disagree with. If you ignore the organized crime, the violence, the drugs, you still see a lot of little unpleasant things that each character does. Sean's handling of his wife's cheating really struck me. He apologized first because it was clear that she wanted him to, for his anger and for him pushing her away, even though it was his wife who cheated. That made me think a lot more of him, and a lot less of his wife. But that dynamic was what saved the marriage.I think there's a lot of this in the book - how each character contributed to the story, their actions, right and wrong, woven so intricately into their community, and how it was like a domino effect.I love Lehane's writing style as well, just the right amount of descriptive writing, action, and dialogue. It's very readable. Great book!
