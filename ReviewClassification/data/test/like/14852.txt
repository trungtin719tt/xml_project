Rain Rain Go Away.This is a wet novel. Set in the rainy season in Oregon you get pruned fingers flipping through the pages. It's lovely. The writing is lovely. I was constantly thinking of turning down corners to mark passages only to turn the page and find something more beautifully written.This can come off as a man's story at first, it's about loggers and brothers, sons and fathers, but I'm not a man and I was completely caught up from the middle to the end. (You have to be patient in the beginning, it takes a while to set the stage, but once the stage is set...). I can't seem to find a way to tell you about it without ruining the surprise. I knew nothing about this book when it was handed to me. I hadn't read any reviews. I think that is the best way to read this novel. Let it surprise you.I will say this. It's a bit unsatisfying, the ending, but it has occupied my mind from the second I turned the last page. "What now?" I wonder. I want to hop on the boat with the boys and on the bus with the girl and see where these characters go. Perhaps that's the best ending of all.Go read it.
