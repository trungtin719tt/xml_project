Initial thoughts:1. Quick read. The style of verse pulls you into Kristina's reality quickly and with a jolt.2. Ellen Hopkins is able to convict a lot of raw emotion in very few words.3. A dark and fast paced introduction to the destructive nature of drugs/meth.4. Knowing that this story is loosely based on a true story (the author's daughter) made the read more impactful.5. Intriguing to see how Kristina changes, especially moving from one environment to another. To see the monsters grasp wherever Kristina goes.Click here to check out my video review!
