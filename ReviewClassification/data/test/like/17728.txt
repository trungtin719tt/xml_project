Since the school year started, I've been forced to read this to (or, more accurately, read along with) my daughter...about 4 million times.Ok. Maybe I'm exaggerating.She's a BIG girl now, so they have to read for 15 minutes every day after school, which I think is GREAT!Except for the part where I have to listen to this story, and others like it, for the rest of the school year.Yes, the end result (hopefully, a literate child) is totally worth it.And for whatever reason,Go, Dog. Go!has become her favorite choice for this assignment.The great thing about this one is the repetitive use of sight words that every kid needs to be able to quickly recognize.For that reason alone, this thing is worth its weight in gold for beginning readers.Then, of course, it has wacky dogs doing wacky dog things.Can't go wrong with that, can you?Not if you're a kid!My favorite part of the book is the Two Dogs and the Hat stuff.No, it's not exactly comedy gold, but my daughter always does this funny little high-pitched voice for the girl dog, and a low (which still sounds squeaky coming from her)manlyvoice for the boy dog.It's adorable.Then again, I'm probably just biased.If you've got a little kid who's learning how to read, go get this sucker.Sure, you'll be ready to tear your hair out after a few readings, but they'll love it.It's calledsacrifice. Now suck it up, and grab this for your kid.
