Ray Bradbury is one of my absolute favorite authors, and SOMETHING WICKED is a book I've read 3 times over the past 17 years. To me, no other author delivers so much energy and emotion with just a word or two than Bradbury. He was definitely one of our national treasures and this is his most magical book. Highly recommended.
