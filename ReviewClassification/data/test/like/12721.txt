Two books in this series down.A hundred to go.Just kidding but there are a lot books in the Southern Vampire (better known as True Blood) series. I don't know if I'll read them all, my attention span is not the best, but I'm loving these books so far.In Living Dead In Dallas we once again spend time with our heroine Sookie Stackhouse and her "interesting" friends. Sookie is a bit grating, Bill is still boring, but thankfully we finally get more Eric.I hope in future books we get to know more about how &amp; why vampires decided to come out of the shadows. I also want to learn more about the vampire society. I also won't mind if Sookie &amp; Bill broke up(can you tell I'm not a fan of Bill?).I really need to watch the show.Around the Year in 52 Books: A book where the MC or Author is a different ethnic origin, religion, or sexual identity than my own.Read-A-Thin May Challenge: A book with a MC that is opposite of you.
