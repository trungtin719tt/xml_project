When I first read "The Talisman" I was roughly the same age as, if not younger than, the 12-year-old protagonist, Jack Sawyer. I remember it being a pretty good adventure story about a young boy on a quest to save his mother, and I remember enjoying it, but I couldn't remember much about it.I'm in my 40s now, older and hopefully a bit wiser, and I happened to stumble upon a paperback copy of the book amongst my vast collection of tomes, so I decided to pick it up and zip through it. I figured, it's Stephen King AND Peter Straub, two really great writers of horror and dark fantasy, so at the very least it was going to be a good yarn.Let me just say that, upon reading the first paragraph, I was immediately hooked in a way that I doubt I was when I first read it (back in middle school? Over two decades ago? Really?). I was actually more than hooked, I was enthralled. Nay, transported, much like the protagonist is transported, to another world. The powerhouse writing team of King and Straub have acheived something wondrous here.Imagine if Tolkein's Middle-Earth and Lewis' Narnia had been discovered by two 20th-century college students. And what would happen if these two college kids, by stepping through that wardrobe door, introduced something horrible into those fantasy realms? What if they infected Narnia with 20th-century cynicism, and they brought drugs and guns and pettiness and hatred and disease? A fascinating premise, one which King/Straub explore in wonderful and disturbing detail.I guess I couldn't remember much of this book when I was a kid because much of it was a little over my 12-year-old head. I get it now. And it's awesome. "The Talisman" is more than just a good fantasy yarn. It's a coming-of-age story. It's an allegory about adolescence. It's a story of how jaded and fallen and perverted we have become as a society and a species and how we are destroying our planet and our youth and our hope for the future. It's a fantasy story that Tolkein or Lewis probably couldn't (or wouldn't) have told because it required the perspective of two writers who are used to staring into the dark and yanking the unpleasant (and slimy) things out of it.
