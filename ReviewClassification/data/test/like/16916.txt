::SPOILER ALERT::Before anything else, I'm just going to get this part out of the way...So I'm reading this book, and for awhile there I was wondering why it had so many bad reviews? I was having a lot of fun with the world, the characters and the charming love story.Then...chapter 8 happened!Seven chapters into this story, we view Bianca as a shy 16 year old kid. She's mad at her parents for bring her toEvernight, a bordering school that her parents will be teaching at. She doesn't think she belongs in a school that is rich with people who see them selves better then everyone else. In fact, she knows she doesn't belong. Never the less, she's got good parents who only want the very best, and Evernight is the best. Bianca is your typical loner, but she was just like your average everyday gal...I always knew this was a vampire book, but the way it was delivered was just...wrong!Chapter Eight? Bianca just bit into Lucas? So I'm expecting her to just Freak-The-Hell-Out! But no, no, we find a Bianca whoknewthat she was a Vampire, All.A.Long!! In fact, she new her parents, the same snotty kids that went to Evernight and even the teachers were all, indeed, Vampires?!? No clues, hints, nothing mentioned in the previous 7 chapters before? Just nothing!The entire tone of the book was completely different. It was so misleading, it felt like doing a U-turn on on-coming traffic!To say that I was baffled is an understatement. I had to put the book down to mentally prepare myself to read it in a completely different way. I have no idea what the author was trying to accomplish my confusing readers this way, but now I understand where a lot of bad reviews come in.But with that said, I still really just liked this book. A lot. I liked the storyline. It almost has an underline sameness to my favorite manga/anime Vampire Knight (but VK was way better). The pace was a bit slow, but I liked it cause I was already invested in the story anyways.The writing was well done, it pulled me into the world (both times) and I just couldn't help loving Bianca and Lucas. And all that they stood for.What would you do if you were in love with someone who was suppose to be your sworn enemy?Call me a sucker, but this is my kind of paranormal happy!Looking forward to Stargazer, and hoping that there isn't another loop that will mess me up:P
