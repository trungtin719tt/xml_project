"These people are assholes, assholes! They have no intelligence! They don't know how to think! They're afraid of the mind! They're sick! They're cowards! They aren't thinking men like you and me"A writer whostrugglesto make ends meet so he takes every job he can possibly find. Bukowski's writing is sharp, brutal, raw. The story at some parts I could even describe it as depressing.. (lost count of how many jobs he changed or how many females he slept with) For me Factotum is brilliant.Having read Ask the dust it's obvious what effect Fante had on Bukowski. I found so many similarities, but I still like Factotum more.I am so glad that I read it again because there were so many quotes I've missed when I first read it.People don't need love. What they need is success in one form or another. It can be love but it needn't beFactotumI guess it'snota book for everyone, but those who dare to read it will find some things to like about it.
