"I did not know that a young girl who has no sense of self and is pretty, just evokes a kind of predatory sexuality in men who are as weak themselves."I'm not much of a memoir person, but this testimony needed to be told and I'm glad I had the opportunity to read it. Fair warning: this book is very intense, especially for readers who may have experienced the same traumas as the author. The blunt, straightforward writing is what makes it so compelling, and the author's strength is simply unparalleled.
