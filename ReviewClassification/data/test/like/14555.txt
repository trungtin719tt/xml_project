An easy 5 stars!I listened to this lovely short audiobook. It's completely charming. The voices are perfect. And in an odd way it reminded me of what I love about Goodreads. Strangers connecting over their mutual love of books. Slowly the book focused repartee morphs into a real sense of affinity and frienship.A bit of warmth to ease the dark cold days of November. A nice relief from the miserable state of world politics.I'm late to this party, but I highly recommend it -- especially the audio.
