Some readers really don't like this book and I'm not entirely sure why.Maybe it's because I'm not a mother and I did find it believable that Eva doesn't love her son completely.Maybe it's because I enjoy the big words that were used in the letters and found it believable that she would write this way.Maybe I'm a sucker for good endings and this one ended with a bang.I think the writing was superb and despite it being a hard book to read (the incident with the maps was particularly brutal), it was worth it. I think this dealt with the issue of school killings much more effectively than Jodi Picoult's Nineteen Minutes. The character of Kevin did come alive for me and he was believable. I didn't even think that counseling might be an option because Franklin 100% believed that his son was fine and probably would have opposed Eva if she had suggested it. Just like she never thinks about them divorcing, she also never considers giving her son help.Overall, I'm glad I was able to finish it and I'm going to read more of the author's works.
