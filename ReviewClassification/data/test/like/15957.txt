This was my first time reading Nicholas Sparks. I never even seen any of the movies. I must say I am a new fan, for sure. This story was truly beautiful. I don't know if I can even explain why I loved this book so much. The characters are great, the romance is done well, and the conclusion was deeply satisfying. I am eager to see the film, now!When I think of NS I think gooshy, sappy romance with a hint of sadness...that's what I always hear his books are like. This one, though, was a bit different than I expected. The writing style was amazing, because switching between the comforting, safe life Katie has now, and Kevin's search for her makes for an edge of your seat read. Very suspenseful. Very well done.
