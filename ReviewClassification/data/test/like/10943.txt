**4.75Adam makes this bookStars**Where She Wentturned out to be a better book, for me, than the first book.If I Stayis the first book in the series and I ended up giving it 3 stars. I had a hard time connecting with the first book but this book being told from Adam's POV was captivating.Three years have passed since the accident andMia and Adamare no longer together. Both have moved on with their personal and musical lives. Adam happens to stumble upon one of Mia's concerts and from that concert they begin to work out what went wrong all those years ago.I listened to the audio of this one and enjoyed that I could cook dinner and not interrupt my "reading." I threw my headphones in and stuck the iPhone in my pocket while I did household chores. If you haven't gotten hooked on audios you really should give them a try. On another note, I still haven't seen the movie-If I Staybut I plan to because I like movies that makes you cry. And one last thing, yes,Oregonis still mentioned in this book which is always a plus for me.SERIES:2 part series
