Enjoyable book, with an endearing main character that sees dead people. I love his name - Odd Thomas - and I'm thinking it would be a great name for a dog (they say dogs see dead people, too, and they're so lovable - a lot like Koontz's character!). Parts of the book lagged on for me, especially the middle, and I think the end is pretty predictable, but I liked Odd, so I liked the book. I considered a 3 star rating, but I will continue the series, so I bumped it up to 4 stars.
