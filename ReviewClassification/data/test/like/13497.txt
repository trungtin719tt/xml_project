HOLY SHIT. This book in one gif:WHAT WAS THAT. What did I just read. I still can't.. OH MY GOD.(I can't even express myself anymore. Look at what this book did to me.)I liked Shatter Me, but THIS book was unbelievable. It blew me away. &lt;3This was me when(view spoiler)[ they found out that A and W are brothers.(hide spoiler)]These were my thoughts onchapter 62: (I pretty much died.)Guys, I'm Team Warner. 100%.And I honestly have NO CLUE how this love triangle is going to end. I mean, we all knew Bella was going to pick Edward; we all knew Nora would eventually end up with Patch. But here? I HAVE NO IDEA. But I really, really want it to be Warner.(PS: I love Kenji.)
