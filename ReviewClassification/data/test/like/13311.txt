Oh my! What a find. What a great book! I need to look up which of my Goodreads friends reviewed this and brought it to my attention. Thank you! I joined Goodreads because I HAVE to read and want to read great books. As I read the last page of this book, my first thought was, "I love Goodreads!"At a time when we are questioning our reverence for Confederate history, this book brings to light the heart of Confederate humility and loyalty.This is a story of a young man, Will Tweedy, as he sorts out family values, community prejudices, Christian assumptions, and his hope for the future in a changing society.Will shares with us his dreams, his pranks, his mourning of a best friend, the loss of his grandmother, his being the first young man in his community to drive an automobile, and his first kiss. Central to Will's life is his Grandfather Blakeslee, who scandalizes the town when he marries a young, pretty woman, three weeks after his wife dies and saying, "Miss Mattie Lou was as dead as she'd ever be."This book is adroitly written in such diverse ways. The story was captivating. The characters were well developed and lovable. The voice was amazing! I could not have done what this author did. She captured the voice of a young boy becoming a man and used the southern dialect in such a way that I fell into it. Found myself thinking in a "down-south, down-home" way. And yet, with very few exceptions I was able to follow the meaning in sentences without getting lost. I couldn't read as fast as I usual, but I got it. And I loved it.This book would probably mean more to you if you are a Christian, but it's so great, I think you would love it even if you were not.
