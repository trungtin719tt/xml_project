"Here is a test to find whether your mission to Earth is finished; If your alive it isn't."Why write of the book when it could be more fun to explain the reactions of several other people who have read this one. Before I say anything else I feel it needs a health warning. The symptoms that I have witnessed as people read this book include, delusional psychosis, fantasising in public, maniac attempts at cloud bursting and one very very bruised nose. (A result of a grown man trying to swim in the grass on a very dry day in Hackney. If only he hadn't decided to dive in.) Also most of these poor crazed Richard Bach Fans discover something mystical and illuminating within themselves as they read the book. Unfortunately all of them want to share this great gift with everyone, so get used to some rather odd lectures if your Partner, flatmate, best friends, or children lay their hands on a copy of this book.The story however is brilliant, A Messiah who wants to quit. A pilot who doesn't want to fly using machines anymore. Written masterfully and with a huge degree of characterisation. If you have read Jonathon Livingston Seagull (also by Richard Bach) then this is an evolution of that first book. However dangerous the book may be its a must have on any shelf. I hate to admit it but this book is enlightening, entertaining, thought provoking, but above all original. A one off. The mould was smashed up afterwards because I have never read anything quite like this. Nor have you.YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK!!!!!
