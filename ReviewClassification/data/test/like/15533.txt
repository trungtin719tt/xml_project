This is going to kill me waiting..lol..I HATE BILL with a passion that b urns brighter than the sun and I wish that she would have killed him instead of killing off Claudine whom was such a sweet and loving character. The end of the book.. Niall says, "The vampire is a good man and he loves you.." Sookie has the BALLS... THE BALLS to wonder which one he meant.. Eric or Bill.. OF CORSE HE MEANT ERIC ASSHOLE!!!!! What a slut..lol.....I wonder if anyone can tell that I am totally for ERIC!!! He is so sweet and you can tell that he loves her and that he wants her.. not because of what she is ie. pretty, busty, telepath... he loves her for her.. and she is just a friggin retard..Sorry.. I have waited so long for this friggin book and I was happy when she said that it was him and her an no one else.. that they were going to try and take the relationship where it needed to go... just to get aggrivated when she starts being all about Bill's welfare. I understand that he risked his life for her, and that he said he has always loved her.. but he is still just a lying bastard..and he has hurt Sookie. At least Eric has NEVER lied to her. He has never hurt her. He would do anything for her.... I just want to know what it was that kept him from her when the fearies took her.. they still need that talk.OK.. my rant is over... for now..lol...
