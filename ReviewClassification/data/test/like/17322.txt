Just arrived from Australia through BM.What a magnificent book, one of the best books on World War II I have ever read.This first volume tells the saga of Victor "Pug" Henry, a middle-aged Naval officer and confidant of the President Franklin Delano Roosevelt.In my opinion, the main point of this book is the accurate description of the development of World War II, starting with the Nazi's occupation in Poland. Russian's fight was the following historical event and this volume ends with the Pearl Harbor attack.Foreword:Peace, if it ever exists, will not be based on the fear of war, but on the love of peace. It will not be the abstaining from an act, but the coming of a state of mind. In this sense the most insignificant writer can serve peace, where the most powerful tribunals can do nothing.by Julian BendaOpening lines:Commander Victor Henry rode a taxicab home from the Navy Building on Constitution Avenue, in a gusty gray March that matched his mood.The Winds of Waris a 1983 miniseries which was made based on this book.The sequel of this book isWar and Remembrancewhich I will start to read pretty soon since I cannot wait to know what happens next.
