Where to start with this one! Seldom have I ever read a book that actually made my blood boil with rage, but this did it! I can, unfortunately, relate to the utter misery that Andy faces while at Runway, while my own clearly does not amount to her cataclysmic year of agony.Having seen the movie well over 20 times, I found the book to be very little like the movie in most regards. The book is far more depressing, but far more real, and thus far more enjoyable. If you've never read this book, do so in order to gain a glimpse into what total suffering can be.Regarding Miranda Priestly, it is rare that I have come across a character that deserves a slow a horrid death, but she deserves to die slowly. No matter the talent the woman had in editing, I would argue that her knee caps be shot out, one at a time, six months apart, then followed by her thumbs being removed with piano wire. Lastly, her tongue should have been removed with acid. Once finished with these (perhaps one year later, maybe two), poisoning by strychnine would be administered in order for her to suffocate and die of asphyxiation.Or, on the lighter side, simply putting several ounces of glass dust into her damned Starbucks's latte would be enough to grind her internal organs into hamburger over several months of a painful and slow death.No human being like Miranda should be allowed to live on Earth.
