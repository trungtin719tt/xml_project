Wow. This book was so good I am speechless.Asher, his Hasidic Jewish family and life, his art, his youth, his sadness.The characters, the pacing.I thought it was a perfect book.I know I read this in Jr. High or High School, and I know it meant nothing to me then. It's amazing how one can read and comprehend the words, and regurgitate ideas to pass a test - but not understand any of it. Re-reading it as an adult who has lived life, raised children, studied art - it's amazing to feel it instead of just read it.
