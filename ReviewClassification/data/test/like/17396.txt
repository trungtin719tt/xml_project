Love it! I've been waiting a long time to revisit Midkemia and Kelewan because there are just so many books in this series, and once you start, you just have to read them all.Magician really is sweeping in its scope, both in years and distance as well as sheer inventiveness. The characters are not deeply drawn and the dialogue can sometimes be a bit cheesy, but the story is always gripping, there are no bits where you skip or go "bored now".I first read the Riftwar Saga in 1987 as a 16 year old one half term, and was totally gripped, staying up for five nights in a row finishing all three books. On a rereading for possibly the fifth or sixth time, with an adult perspective, the books are still definitely worth a read as the story is good and satisfyingly complex. They certainly don't meet the Bechdel test though (the criteria of containing at least two female characters who talk to each other about something besides a man)as there are few female characters, and those that there are are certainly not developed other than to be a foil to the male characters.Lack of decent female characterisation aside, the story of Pug and Tomas was definitely worth another read and has set me up for a couple of months of exclusive Raymond E Feist books as it's just not possible to read anything else in between. I'm also moving into uncharted territories as I've not read anything past the end of the Serpentwar Saga, so have many more books to get through this time.
