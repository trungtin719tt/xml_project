MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading ListI finished this book in tears. I'm not sure there are many that haven't done the same. What is there left for me to say that I'm sure so many people have already said about this book. It made me mad, made me sad, made me cry, made me happy.The things these two sisters went through during this horrible time is unbelievable. I know this is a work of fiction but the truth is there in things that have happened. More atrocities than are in this book. But, I'm talking about THIS book.All of these people they talk about in this book trying to survive. They are starving, they are killed, they are destroyed. But there are a few brave souls willing to risk their lives to help as many as they can.To me, this book is about struggle, compassion you didn't know you could have, broken hearts and lives. All of these things for some sadistic idiot. I can never understand the things people do to other people, they still do!The story of Vianne and her sister Isabelle is something that gets inside of your heart and makes you route for them and for all they do. Your on the edge of your seat through a lot of it!I'm just at a loss for words at how much this book touched my heart. I recommend it to anyone who also has a heart.*I would like to thank St. Martin's Press and my book group for a copy of this wonderful book*
