Contrary to what others say about this series, I think they're quite good. Ok I will admit the first few books were a little slow and perhaps could have been condensed a bit, but this series is getting better. I gotta say I like the informal vibe of these books and the fact that they stand out in their own way. I'm liking this world more and more as I read along!
