Hollywood is run by men. And men are cruel.It doesn't help when things like the wish to please and to be loved come into play for women like the three that this book is about. This was an unexpectedly burdensome read that I didn't expect to affect me as much as it did.Valley of the Dollscenters around the friendship of three young women: The romantic Anne, the talented Neely and the beautiful Jennifer. All three of them come to New York in the 40s in order tomake itand over the course of twenty years we get to witness their rise and fall."Women sure were funny - you could talk your head off and get nowhere, but then let them spend ten minutes alone together in a powder room and anything could happen..."It's an alarming story of how sometimes things just don't work out.It's hard enough to figure out what it is you want from life, but this novel is proof that even when you know it, may that be love or a career, getting it is a whole different matter. What all the characters have in common, is that they'redesperate. They all make horrible choices, they lie, they take drugs, they cheat. But worst of all is that all of them think they're doingthe right thing, simply what's best for them."There is no such thing as love, the way you talk about it. You'll only find that kind of love in cheap movies and novels. Love is companionship, having friends in common, the same interests."This certainly isn't a perfect book.Not taking the extreme lack of positivity in this book into account, this still is an odd kind of novel. While I personally never felt bored, the pacingdidfeel off occasionally, certain story lines drifted off into nothingness, while others kept making unexpected returns. But in a way, that's how life works. I just hope that life won't treat us as badly as it has these women.
