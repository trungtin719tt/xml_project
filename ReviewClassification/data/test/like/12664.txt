WHATTHEFUDGEI knew you didn't expect me to ever say this (didn't expect it myself)but this is the first school book I absolutely LOVED.Like, loved-adored-wanttomarry. I gave it 5 stars at first, then decided to lower that to4.5 starsbecause I had some minor (really minor) issues with it.I literally expected this to be pure crap, the worst smelly dung so to call it (most schoolbooks kind of are, especially the books our English teachers give us) (except this year, apparently we have better books to read now). But from the first page on, I was hooked, which really surprised me because (apart from the schoolbook-thing), I rarely reach for this genre (religious-themed books).The book is about a boy named Asher Lev, who is a Hasidic Jew living in NYC. Hasidic Jews are one of the strictest kind of Jews and Asher's parents (mostly his father) is super orthodox. He works for a man named the Rebbe, who is kind of the leader of the worldwide community of Hasidics. The book starts when Asher is like five or six years old and focusses on his biggest passion: drawing. Only prob: the Hasidic community considers drawing to be really bad and from the 'Other Side', meaning the non-Hasidic world. Ashers drawing causes conflict between him and his parents and the community.I realize my description is pretty crappy: this book isn't. The writing is absolutely beautiful and very touching at times. The character development is so realistic and I have the feeling I learned so many things about Jews and their entire world of rules and habits and about art in general. The main point of the book is whether Asher choses between his upbringing (the Hasidic faith) or his passion: drawing and painting. And this struggle is so real and honest and understandable, that it will make you shout and cry and do whatever at the same time.
