My review can also be found on my blogCollections.After reading The Golden Lily, I was on a high for months. I just adored that book so freaking much! Even when I eventually managed to calm down, I still had to get some kind of Sydney and Adrian fix at least a few times a week (thank you Tumblr!). It kept me sane, but it was never enough. Then starting about three weeks prior to the release of The Indigo Spell, I realized that I could not read a single book. No matter how hard I tried I couldn't focus on other stories. All I wanted was The Indigo Spell. I NEEDED it in my life! Basically, the wait for The Indigo Spell was complete and utter torture, and it was such a relief when the release date finally arrived.If I haven't made it clear enough, I'm obsessed with the Bloodlines series and the relationship between Sydney and Adrian. The Indigo Spell is definitely a Sydrian fan's dream come true! Not only for the romance (although I will be talking about the romance in a bit), but with how much both Sydney and Adrian have developed and grown as people. They are awesome and inspiring, and I can't help but to adore them to pieces.I've admired and believed in Sydney ever since she appeared in Blood Promise. And it's amazing how much she has changed! I always knew homegirl had it in her to do what was necessary to protect her loved ones, even if it went against her beliefs. And I think it's great that Sydney wants to be known as more than a brainy and reliable person. She feels all kinds of emotions just like everyone else. She likes to be complimented and even gets jealous of others. And she wants to feel beautiful, especially to be called beautiful by Adrian. Sydney's honest personality and her insecurities make her such a relateable person in my eyes.The transformation Adrian has gone through is probably the most surprising to me. After that shocking ending in The Golden Lily, I expected Adrian to be hardcore moody and snarky to Sydney. It seems he was at first, but then he had a epiphany and realized he had to try a different approach with Sydney or neither of them would be happy. Adrian was seriously all chill and calm in this book. It was amazing to witness how much patience he has learned. He wants to do things right with Sydney, unlike the disaster with Rose, and he wants to be a better person. This change really worked for him, and I'm glad that through it all he never lost his hilarious and loveable personality.Sydney and Adrian's relationship is so fun to read about. They have a strong friendship and a passionate romance developing between them. They compliment each other so well and continue to bring out the best in one another. I love how Adrian's determination to become a better person all started because of Sydney, and I love that Sydney has become more confident because of Adrian. I also love how adorable and hilarious they are together. Sydney may be clueless about romance, but she is no prude. Little Miss Quick Study! You go, Sydney! But I'm seriously going to cut the next person who interrupts their um...moments. I'm sure my poor Adrian won't be able to handle it much longer either. I cannot wait for everything to work out smoothly between them because they have one of the best relationships and are meant to be together!I do have some minor complaints about some of the things that occurred in this book though. First, Marcus Finch really wasn't a big deal. I don't think he's a horrible character, but I don't think I care what happens to him. Another thing, although I think Sydney is brilliant, she did some not-too-smart things near the end. I almost wanted to hurt her. She did pull through, so I'm hoping we never have to experience something like that again. Finally, I thought this book was too short. It went by too fast! It's actually shorter than the first two books, yet it has way more plot lines to follow. If there's going to be many plot lines, I want it to be longer. Seems like the short length will continue into book four, which I can't help but to feel a bit disappointed about considering we will also be getting Adrian's POV.That being said, The Indigo Spell has the most action and romance out of all the Bloodlines books released so far! I feel that it also made the world that we first learned about in Vampire Academy even bigger. There were many surprises and the beginnings of more revelations to come. This series continues to be one of my favorites ever, and I'm so looking forward to more Sydney and Adrian in book four, The Fiery Heart!
