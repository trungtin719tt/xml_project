"Love means never having to say you're sorry"is probably among some of the most ridiculous statements ever........Luckily it's a rare blemish on a simple but beautiful story. Plus it's cheesy, corny, and insanely quotable, so I'll have to give it a pass on that.A girl and a boy meet and fall in love.Jenny is a poor artistic sorta-Catholic Radcliffe-educated Italian-American brainiac with a razor-sharp tongue. Oliver is a rich WASPy Harvard "Preppy" jock with a slew of Daddy issues and a Roman numeral after his name. They fall in love despite the huge social gap between them. Few more Daddy issues ensue, a fight or two happens, the cheesy phrase (see above) is uttered to my sheer mortification. They may or may not name their future kid Bozo the Clown. ThenJenny dies*gasp*. And I bawl my eyes out.No worries, no spoiler tags were needed. We are warned about her death in the very first (and famous) paragraph."What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died? That she was beautiful and brilliant. That she loved Mozart and Bach. The Beatles. And me."We know about Jenny's death from the start, and it is a true testament to Segal's brilliant characterization and narrative skills thather death still hits home, still leaves all but the most heartless readers a bawling blob of tears and snot.It did so for me, and I am a self-proclaimed cold-hearted cynic.This book is written in a fresh and honest voice. The characters feel truly alive. It is beautiful, simple, short and funny. It is sweet and touching but not overly melodramatic. It is a quintessential love story and is fully worth the few well-spent reading hours.I've read it several times since age 12, and every time it melts my stony callousy heart."What the hell makes you so smart?" I asked."I wouldn't go for coffee with you," she answered."Listen - I wouldn't ask you.""That," she replied, "is what makes you stupid."
