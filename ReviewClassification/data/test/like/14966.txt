I would never have read this book, had it not been left in a pile of paperbacks on a rig offshore, and I had I not finished the two books I brought with me already. I honestly had no idea what to expect, and almost put it down after 13 pages becauseTalladega Nightswas on HBO.But I didn't, and I spent large chunks of my afternoons once back onshore reading this monstrosity. Beach Music is a grand, sweeping novel of a Southern man in a Southern city in a Southern state (South Carolina, ironically). But it's more than that. It's a novel about families and relationships, births and deaths, and coming of age.It's also a seriously wordy tome. 800 pages of very small type. It rambles in places, too. I could easily get rid of 200+ pages without affecting the main storyline one bit. The dialogue is sharp and, at times, quite funny. The characters are flawed, but likeable.But for all its faults, all you really need to know is that I had trouble putting it down.
