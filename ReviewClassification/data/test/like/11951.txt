As a Shopaholic myself, I found this book really enjoyable. If you like shopping at all, this book will make you laugh. The main character gets into funny situations constantly. It's not an advanced physics treatise, but it's not mindless either. The effort the main character goes to to justify her shopping is hilarious and some genius plotting on Kinsella's part. If you don't like shopping at all, look elsewhere. If you like funny, memorable characters and plots, then give this a try.A friend of mine doesn't want to read this book because she thinks it will make her feel bad about her shopping habits. Trust me, the main character is worse than you could ever be. So don't count it out because you think it might expose you.I am happy to report that I saw the author speak, and she is delightful, nice, funny, and deserving of your book purchase!
