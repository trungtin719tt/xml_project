Wow. I did not expect this book to be that perspective changing. The dynamic cast of characters and heart-wrenching circumstances, the whole book pushing towards the light. Every terrible circumstance, every broken character, every story told points more and more to God. I would give it more stars if I could.I expected to like Christy, but I didn't expect to love it as much as I did. I grew up on the TV series, which really only gave a glimpse of this book.Being the same age as Christy, I really connected with her emotions. I could relate to her feelings and her relationship with God.This book had some very hard stuff on it. Catherine Marshall didn't sugar coat the truth. But I have never read a book that so completely, wholely pointed to Christ. This book made me want to draw closer to God. I could tell you what this book meant to me, but I think this is one of those books that everyone will draw something different from.I wouldn't recommend this to anyone under 16 because of mature content, death, disease, and bad living conditions. But I would recommend over 16 it to anyone looking for an amazingly powerful story.
