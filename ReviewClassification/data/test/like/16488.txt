I read Stephen King's "Joyland" at the same time. Being a fan, I was eager to live in his head for awhile. But as I just wrote on "Joyland"'s page, it was oddly flat ride, dull really. And then I read "Walks Away Woman" and everything amped up about 200%. The energy, the feel of the desert, the voice of the woman tramping about with her purse and then her donkey, was alive and witty. I couldn't wait to be done with "Joyland." I set "Walks Away Woman" aside with a sigh. Maybe in a few months or so, I can read it again. I sure want to.
