I absolutely loved this book. Hillenbrand's pacing and style draw's the reader in. Her attention to detail is captivating from the very first page. This is a book teeming with interesting and fascinating characters, not the least of which is Seabiscuit himself. As I read this book, I grew to love this magnificent animal; his quirky and mischievous personality, his gluttonous eating habits, his inner peace and serenity through tumultuous periods and, most of all, his unrelenting courage against all odds in the heat of "battle." Such a noble beast! And of course, the supporting cast is equally engaging. I was deeply moved by the story of the flawed and irrepressible jockey, Red Pollard; endlessly amused by the antics of the kindly yet irascible trainer Tom Smith; and felt like I was in the "owner's box" with the dedicated and generous owner Charles Howard and his wife Marcela, sharing in the thrills and heartbreaks of Seabiscuit's legendary exploits.On top of the fantastic characterization, Hillenbrand offers up not one, but two exciting climaxes(!), both of which left me absolutely breathless and spellbound: Seabiscuit's defining race with the magnificent War Admiral; and Red Pollard's race for redemption and final great victory at the 1940 Santa Anita Handicap.This is a beautifully crafted book that, is a "can't miss" for just about anyone!
