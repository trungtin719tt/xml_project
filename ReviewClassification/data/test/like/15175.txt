Ahhhh such much action! The way the explosion was written was just perfect, the scene played in my mind just like an action movie. I'll definitely give Charlaine Harris credit, she knows how to write her battle and action scenes, in a way that's perfectly descriptive - not under or overly so.I wish that Sookie hadn't taken so long to figure out the entire thing though, she sort of just kept it all locked up in her mind for ages - it frustrated the fuck out of me. As soon as I'd encountered Jake Purifoy in the hotel room with the hotel staff/Fellowship members, I'd have gone straight to the Queen or to the head of security. And then Barry totally knew what was going on, but was too pissweak to say anything in case it got humans killed. *stabs*I loved the addition of the Britlingens, I hadn't even thought about extradimensions and creatures from other realms in the Sookie verse! I wish Amelia would hurry up and figure out how to turn Bob back into a human, her presence isn't really achieving anything and she's kind of lingering around longer than she needs to (okay I know New Orleans is still a mess, but whatever).
