Yep I'm an addict. I can't get enough of these books. I think i'm going to get through the entire series within this next week. Don't judge. They are awesome! You are just so jealous that you are clearly missing out on all the fun! Ok, so maybe not but still! If you want a little mystery, a lot of supes, drama, cheesy things, and a total love octagon thing then these are your books. Go get them!!!(PST!!! If you haven't already read the previous books in this series *cough*slackers*cough* then you know the drill. SPOILER ALERT!!!)In this fun installment we find our dear Sookie being sought after by Quin (Oh la la) , politically hijacked by the queen of Louisiana from Eric (Snicker! Poor Eric), and off to claim the inheritance left by her cousin Hadley! (DUN dun DUUUN). There is a lot more little side things that happen in this book but I won't mention them because I thought they were all great little tidbits into the life going on in Bon Temps. Plus I don't want to inadvertently ruin anything for any future readers of the series. I can and will say that I really don't know how Sookie can keep everything together with all the stuff thrown at her pretty much constantly. The girl deserves a medal or something!
