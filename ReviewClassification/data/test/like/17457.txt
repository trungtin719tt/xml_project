I never wanted this book to end.This book is so great. It's well written, it's rule breaking, it's terrifying, the characters are as realistic as they come, and it sticks with you. Don't ask me why, you know why: because it's a great book. It's romantic, sometimes it's hard to keep on reading, it's gritty, it'shaunting. It's also VERY WORTH IT. I highly recommend it.I would like to add a brilliant, brilliant description of the book here, byJayson:"Tenderness with ferocity. It's lonely, desperate people living in ashen desolation. The grey makes the red stand out."Absolutely wonderful.
