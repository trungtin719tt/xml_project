INITIAL IMPRESIONDamn it, I knew this would happen.I can't believe this ended. I was 16 when I started this series. Two years later, I managed to own all the seven books plus "The Wind Through The Keyhole", even though four of them are in Romanian and four in English.Now, with this installment finished... a part of my heart will relocate itself on the shelf on which they are placed. And every time I will pick up the series for another read I will find myself, aged 16 and in love, between its pages.A part of me will still walk along Roland on his road.. many miles and many wheels, as ka wills it.Serious review to come, commala come-come.REVIEWAttention - listen tothiswhile reading.From time to time, because of how much literature you consume on a daily basis, you forget the miracle of it. You forget how much magic stories contain, you lose the sense of mystery that they bring and it's sad, how you can pass over so many works without ever thinking:this is amazing. I blame this on how literature evolved. Like many (if not all) other art domains, it lost its soul over money. It became an industry, and as always, serializing something and making it a consumer good diminishes its value. This is why older literature is still going strong, it's still being read and people come back to it and compare everything else to it. Because back when Dostoievski was writing his works in order to pay his dues, he had stories to tell. And he had the mind to tell it. Nowadays, anyone can be a writer. And I really mean anyone. It's not hard - you jam up a few words in a Word document, place a title, a subtitle and an awesome quote by a long-dead figure and you give it to an editor. That editor (as many editors do, there's few that are different) will not evaluate the book based on its substance or its meaning, but by how much profit it will bring. (Look atFifty Shades of Greyand you'll get it. It's literary trash and made millions. Because some un-fucked 40 year old moms decided it would be good for their unused vagina to buy the book and read it in the bedroom/bathtub. And do you-know-what to their you-know-what. )This introduction seems to have no connection to Stephen King's work whatsoever. But it does. King is part of the old generation. He started reading and then proceeded to write his own pieces when books weren't yet amarket. And this is why his style was formed by heart, not by dollar signs.The Dark Towerseries is worth it on an incredible amount of levels. Let me put it this way - it's so complex that you can't make a resume out of it, but you're still so in love with it that you'd give it a try. How's that for captivating the reader?I am Stephen King'sConstant Reader, as he calls us. He is, and has been since I was twelve years old (I know, centuries ago, right?)my favorite author. I know some readers are afraid to say that they have a favorite author/book/story, but I have them, alright? I amthattype of reader. I related to King's stories more than anything throughout my life in literature because his monsters are just as real as mine are.Now, I won't try to resume this at a big scale. Put shortly, these 7 (+2, if you countThe Little Sisters of EluriaandThe Wind Through the Keyhole) books are the story of Roland of Gilead's road through many worlds and times (where's and when's), his quest to find and kill the Crimson King and his friendship and love for his companions. The other important characters are Jake Chambers, Eddie Dean and Susannah Dean (yes they become husband and wife, take that for a spoiler)(but this is the last book in the series so I guess you knew that for some time), and they come to his rescue many times, just to help him achieve his goal.He is a sick man. His obsession killed many people over the thousands of years that he had to travel the Universe. And he keeps going, nothing is able to stop, nothing can delay him and if anything or anyone tries to mess his road up, he is simply going to eliminate them. There are no "but's" in this. It's his road.Let's stop with the story itself because you are reading the review for the last book, so you're probably here in order to try and feel more of Roland's life in your mind, even though maybe five minutes ago you closed the book and shoved it at the wall, screaming at the top of your lungs: STEPHEN KING, YOU SICK SON OF A BITCH, HOW DO YOU DARE STOMP INTO MY LIFE AND SHIT ALL OVER IT?! I'm just sayin', you know.. not that that was my reaction.. or.. anything.. you know..Focus.The most amazing thing about this series is, however (for me), the work and heart put in it. Yes, it's not the best written thing you'll ever see, but neither are other King books. Yes, it leaves things untied at the end and loses track of some important features, but it messes you up, and, let's face it, you masochist, you wanted it. Yes, I'm talking to you. You liked it. You expected it to happen because no 9 book series can end with a happy ending, right? ...Focus. Focus.The work. The work that was put in it. Stephen King started writing this when he was 19. As i so beautifully said in my reviewHEREforWolves of the Calla(and I quote myself, haha):Stephen King started writing this when he was 19. I'm almost 19 and still haven't learned how to wipe my ass properly, so to say. (metaphor here, guys. don't take it literally).. HE finished publishing the main body of the series in 2004. BUT! There is a but. At the end of this installment right here, there is a little line saying:June 19, 1970 - April 7, 2004: I tell God thankya.34 years. Thirty-four years. Do you understand? The magnitude? The scale of this? Do you? Do you really?King calls this themagnum opusof his life.I couldn't agree more. This is what King was meant to write. Anything else, his novels, his short stories, his collections, his poems, his essay, his comics, his theatre work, anything else fades away, when compared to this.Because he didn't just write a single-standing story, on itself. No. He combined a massive amount of his own work in this. Let's just start with the Crimson King. Raise your hands if anyone here has ever readThe Stand. Yeah? Sounds fammiliar now? Do you remember Pere Callahan, a character from the book, which we meet in the 5th installment? Have you ever hear of'Salem's Lot? Mmmyeah, me too, sounds like I know it. Might these all be King's own books?They fucking are. They are his own writings, which he has combined into this massive, multiple-thousands page work. And the best thing about it isit all makes sense. It does. It's logical.I've come to wonder if King has wrote everything else because he needed them for the Dark Tower series or wrote the Dark Tower series because he could comprise all of them in this one.Mindfuck...But, wait, there's more! Not only did he place his works in this, he even put himself there. Yes. It's not the first time he's done this, or anyone, for that matter, but his version is downright creepy. He inserted himself, as a character, by his own name, with his own traits, he gave himself the role of author of Roland's world (which he is) and he then made Roland confront him in the made-up world of the series.Makes you wonder if the man is completely sane.I have to thank an entity I don't believe in thathe is not. Bless his madness, because his madness changed the face of literature for good.This review it (not surprinsingly) extremely fragmented. I can't seem to pull myself together in order to write something serious, because seriousness would just take out of how GOOD this work is. GOOD, as in with caps lock, because I need you to hear it booming in your head, like the voice of the Crimson King in Roland's head...Now, see? Everything is a refference to this book after finishing it...If you already read the series(and you liked it) and you're reading this review, please know I love it as much as you do. Maybe more.If you already read the series(and you didn't like it) and you're reading this review, please know that the exit is towards the left of the stage.If you haven't read this series and you want to, I tried to make this spoiler-free, but hear me out: your life will become a smoldering ruin of emotions after you read the last line of the last book of The Dark Tower series. If you're up for that, go on. If you can't stand emotional damage.. don't you even get close.All that being said, I'll find a dark corner and slowly collapse with my back to both walls, hugging my knees and wailing for what Stephen King can do to me. I was just an innocent little girl before I methim....Comma, commala comeThis review is done.I say thankya ...Long days and pleasant nightsBut may you have twice the number.My heart...
