This book on writing was even better than I expected. I loved that Stephen King shared some memories from childhood and explained how he became a writer.This book helped me knock off two goals in one: I've been trying to read the best Stephen King books (good grief, the man is prolific) and I'm trying to read more books about writing. King has good advice on ways to improve your writing, but he also has some knockout stories about his life and how they've influenced his novels.The book ends with a moving section about the day in June 1999 when King had been out for his daily walk and was hit by a van whose driver was distracted. King was hit so forcefully that it's a miracle he wasn't killed or paralyzed. He spent weeks in the hospital. When he returned home, he decided to focus his writing energy on finishing this memoir, and I'm grateful he did.On Writingis a true gem. Highly recommended for any writers wanting advice on getting started or improving their craft, and for fans of Stephen King. Also recommended to anyone who likes books. And even if you don't like books, I'd still urge you to read this. It's just fantastic.Favorite Quotes"If you want to be a writer, you must do two things above all others: read a lot and write a lot. There's no way around these two things that I'm aware of, no shortcut.""I'm a slow reader, but I usually get through seventy or eighty books a year, mostly fiction. I don't read in order to study the craft; I read because I like to read. It's what I do at night, kicked back in my blue chair. Similarly, I don't read fiction to study the art of fiction, but simply because I like stories. Yet there is a learning process going on. Every book you pick up has its own lesson or lessons, and quite often the bad books have more to teach than the good ones."[On writingThe Stand]"At one moment I had none of this; at the next I had all of it. If there is any one thing I love about writing more than the rest, it's that sudden flash of insight when you see how everything connects.""It starts with this: put your desk in the corner, and every time you sit down there to write, remind yourself why it isn't in the middle of the room. Life isn't a support system for art. It's the other way around."
