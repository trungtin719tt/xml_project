Cat and Bones are back in book four of Jeaniene Frost's Night Huntress series. In "Destined for an Early Grave" the two lovers will face their greatest fears and find out just how strong their bond, and their love, can be. This is an action-packed romp with secrets revealed from the past and ends with a new twist on the future. If you're a Cat and Bones fan, you will want to drop everything and RUN to get this one.Cat and Bones are ready to enjoy a leisurely honeymoon filled with sex and well, more sex. And they get that--almost, with the exception of Cat's dreams. Her dreams are of a blond vamp who 'feels' just as powerful as Bones and he keeps saying she's HIS. When they arrive to Paris, Cat and Bones are unhappy to learn that her dreams have more than a passing resemblance to reality. The blond vamp is the one called the Dreamsnatcher and he has the power to literally kidnap people while they dream. He is also adamant that Cat is his wife! Now Cat and Bones and their allies will have to step carefully between minion attacks and vampire politics to straighten out this mess. And with BOTH Cat and Bones trying to protect the other...well, it's gonna be a rocky ride.I don't want to give too much of the plot away cause this one's a doozy. The previous book was mostly action and there's a lot of action in this book too, but there's also quite a bit revealed of Cat's past and her emotions and how both of these affect her relationship with Bones. Bones too, suffers from things in his past that impact Cat's ability to trust which drives Bones nearly insane. Their story is better than any soap opera (and way hotter too) and I can hardly wait for the next installment to feed my fix.As usual, Frost's plot and writing are smooth as silk and the interactions between Cat and Bones sizzle the pages. For me, at its heart this book is about trust. Cat and Bones struggle with the balance of power and trust issues throughout this book. I think more of their inner selves are revealed in "Destined for an Early Grave" than any of Jeaniene Frost's earlier books in this series. I can't get enough of these two and I'm ready and willing to follow the fork in their path destined by the book's ending.
