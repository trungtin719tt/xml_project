Every page of this book I saw as a movie. Every scene is so visual I saw it as if it were on a huge screen. I was IN it. I could taste it, smell it, feel it. Great tale of survival. Not by some sportsman or adventurer. By some average housewife lost in the desert. Turns out she's not so average. Maybe none of us are. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
