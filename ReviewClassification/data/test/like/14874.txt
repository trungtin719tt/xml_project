**4.5 I LOVE KELLAN KYLE STARS**I'll admit it, I think I'm the last person on earth to read this book. What was I waiting for? I have no clue.I don't think I've ever read such an emotional story like this in my life. This story was told beautifully. I don't know how Stephens did it, but she wrote an amazing character in Kellan Kyle. She evoked emotions from me that I don't usually experience from a book. And oh the angst and the tension, the back and forth had my heart and head spinning. I was so involved in the outcome that I had a hard time living in reality. Yes while reading this real life sucked! I just wanted to run home and immerse myself in Seattle with the irresistible Kellan Kyle.This was intense, consuming, passionate, engaging and heartbreaking. After reading all the reviews I was expecting to go into this hating Kiera, but surprisingly I understood her. She was torn between her old love and the luscious Kellan Kyle. What girl could resist that?! There were times when I wanted to slap some sense into her, but I definitely understood her angst and the position she was in even though I didn't agree with how things were handled.Thanks to my girl Patty cause if it weren't for her I don't think I ever would've read this. Hence why I love Goodreads:)
