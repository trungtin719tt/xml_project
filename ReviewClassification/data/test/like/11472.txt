Darn it, I don't know how to post for different editions as this keeps coming up the same despite different illustrators. Here, then, are the three versions I've enjoyed this season with links so you can see them on Amazon.ILLUSTRATED BY GYO FUJIKAWAFujikawa's illustrations are so adorable and delightful and child-like, in a way. I thoroughly enjoyed his vision into this holiday classic, though I would have liked more page breaks and more frequent illustrations to help the flow with the poem better.http://www.amazon.com/Night-Before-Ch...ILLUSTRATED BY CHERYL HARNESSOne of my favorite illustrators for historical picture books, here Harness brings Moore's poem into a lovely Victorian home. I especially enjoy the cat snuggling up next to Santa! ;-)http://www.amazon.com/Night-Before-Ch...ILLUSTRATED BY BECKY KELLYAlthough she is a little "commercial" I still absolutely love Becky Kelly's art and she did not disappoint with these charming illustrations. Adorable to the max, especially with all the little creatures (mice!) and sweet toys that seem to come to life.ADDITION ON THE HISTORY OF THE POEMNOTE: As a happy coincidence, I just watched a Christmas special that discussed a bit about the origins of Santa Claus in America and how Moore's poem was so influential--I knew it was influential, but not exactly HOW influential, as in, he was the first to mention Santa's reindeer! Interestingly, Moore was a minister and didn't even ascribe his name to the poem initially as he was afraid it was too "secular"Also, here is the Thomas Nast's image which became "the" image of Santa. Interesting to note here when I'm comparing illustrated versions of Moore's poem!http://www.stnicholascenter.org/stnic...
