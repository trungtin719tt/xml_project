Wow- what a gorgeously magical gem of a book. I picked this up for a challenge to read a Steampunk book, and had no idea what I was getting into as I opened the cover. Part novel, part graphic novel- the illustrations conveyed strong emotion and were so beautiful.Hugo Cabret- an orphaned boy left alone in the train station to continue turning the clocks, he has to steal his food and is a mechanical genius. The book also incorporates film an automaton that draws a picture merging the past and present together. Throughout the book, I just wanted to take Hugo under my wing and hug him. This is certainly a book I would highly recommend if you haven't come across it yet, especially if you're looking for something different in your reading life.
