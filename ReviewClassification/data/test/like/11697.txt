It's the end of the world as we know itIt's the end of the world as we know itIt's the end of the world as we know itand Jimmy feels fine.Jimmy feels fine.Actually, wait. That's not true. It's the end of the world, and Jimmy's the last human standing and he feels. . . he feels. . . well, Jimmy feels like shit.He's wrapped in a bed sheet, he's filthy, he's hungry, and he's alone, with nothing but his worries, his regrets and some strange non-humans, known as Crakers, to keep him company.And why is Jimmy, the B student, the sex addicted playboy, the wordsmith, the Everyman, still alive? Why should HE still exist while almost everyone else has perished?Well, he had thejackal positionand the trust of a madman, known as Crake, and was therefore favored in the end, when Crake's one man show brought the world down.And as the famous Margaret Mead once said:Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed people can change the world. Indeed, it is the only thing that ever has.Yes, Margaret. . . all groups good,and bad, am I right?This book is a great reminder to beware the despots (know any?), the disgruntled and/or depressed. . . oh, and BIG CORPORATIONS.There is no madness here that seems a spoof, and dear Ms. Atwood confirms for us at the end of the entire trilogy (this is book #1), that all of the science in herfiction trilogyhas a solid basis in truth. Be afraid, people. Be very afraid.This is dystopian fiction, set not too far in the distant future, and, as always, Ms. Atwood gives us a character who is so real, he appears to have DNA.Her side characters are surprisingly unformed (there's far more meat overall on the bones of books 2 and 3), but this is the beginning and it's Jimmy's story, and his well-developed self and the unbelievably quotable quality of this story bumped it up to 5 stars for me in this, my re-read.Oh Jimmy!Ms. Atwood, who is a literary oracle as far as I'm concerned, doesn't preach to us, just reports:There are too many people and that makes people bad.For shit sure, Margaret.In goddess we trust.
