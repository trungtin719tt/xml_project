So I used to work with this girl called Sarah, who was a real no bullshit kind of person. I really liked her because she was intelligent and articulate, someone I could actually hold a conversation with. She was well read, she kept up on current events and she could talk politics while maintaining integrity and respectability. When I saw this book on the break table in the back, I never would have thought that it was hers. When I found out I made fun of her. I couldn't believe a girl like her was reading one of those girly indulgent drugstore bookshelf books about some cutsey flustered vunerable woman who almost manages to overcome her sweet, sugary problems by the last few pages. Almost. Over the next few days, when I would be taking my 20 minutes for lunch, I started to leaf through the book for lack of better reading material (I had read the copy of People from three months prior so many times I could probably name the make-ups, break-ups, new babies and total tramps.) After a few chapters I was inexplicably hooked. I had to know what else the silly little spendthrift was going to get herself into and of course, eventually out of. I read it over the course of about 4 or 5 lunch breaks. It was easy to slip into the back of my mind, underneath the homework assignments and papers and substantial literature I was in the middle of, behind the bills to pay and the jobs to keep up with. It was the easiest book I have ever read, truly light and to be totally honest, well written. The woman has an undeniable personality and voice. I haven't been interested enough to get any of her follow up books, but every time I pass them in the "literature" section at the drug store, I consider it for about half a second.
