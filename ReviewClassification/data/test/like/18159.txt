This is the book. The best book for me. I don't say it's the best book for everyone. But for me, it is my mainstay, my main man, my mainsail. Kazantzakis has made a work of stunning genius. Simple. Funny. And true as Zorba. I first read this book when I had leukemia and was being poisoned by chemo for one solid week--24 hours a day of it for one week, and this book kept me sane and my heart pure.It's about life. How does one live it. How does one deal with the vicissitudes of it. The tragedies. the failures. Does one stand on the sidelines of life and never jump in? does one fear getting married or fear having children or fear doing any activity that could fail or come to naught? Zorba tells us what to do. And in the end, when the whole bloody mess comes falling down around us, and all our plans and schemes are for naught, what do you do? Dance. Dance as hard and as wild as you can. Spit and fume and sing and smash your heels into the dirt. And laugh at it all. the absurdity of worry and wondering. The joy of just "being" and "doing".This book is a philosophy and a trip back into time. When the mechanistic and material world had not such a hold on our Western minds. When things were simple. If a beautiful woman wants you, you go to her. You go to her. You! Go..... to her! It is an insult to life and the gods not to.And see the movie. It is truly one of the few movies that captures a novel precisely. And Anthony Quinn will be remembered through the ages for his Zorba. when you and I are dust, they who will be the living will still be watching him dance.
