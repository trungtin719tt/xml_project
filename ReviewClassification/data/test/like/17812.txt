These stories are to horror literature what hops are to beer--strongly floral, ocasionally overpowering (adjectives, dear lord, so many adjectives), sometimes adding a ridiculous, ill-tasting, or pompous flourish, but utterly essential to keeping the basic recipe interesting. I read some of these stories while I was traveling in England and quite ill, and I recommend them to those with fevers. "The Colour Out of Space" is especially satisfying--effective and creepy.
