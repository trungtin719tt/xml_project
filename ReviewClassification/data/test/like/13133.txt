6/17/20194/5starsthis was better than the first time and I understood a lot more but it was still missing that special something to make it a 5 star!4/11/20163/5starsI'm personally very conflicted over this tale of Murakami's (which is my fourth book I have read by him!) because it was nothing that I was expecting, and I'm not sure if I enjoyed what it turned into.I'm not even really sure if I'll be able to give this a summary. In this novel we follow two separate time lines - one of an unnamed man who is involved in this sci-fi-like world with breaks in the sound barrier, crazy mazes, INKlings, and the System, and another of another unnamed man dubbed the "Dreamreader" who is a man who has found this seemingly perfect Town that is completely surrounded by a wall, and when he enters into the Town he has to give up his shadow. I may have missed something that further brought these two stories together, but they seemed to be linked by the first man meeting a scientist who is doing research of skulls that appear to be from unicorns (and then doing a bunch of research on the mythical animals himself) and the Dreamreader's world actually having these creatures there.I really enjoyed the ride of this book - it was absolutely bizarre, and it wasn't the Magical Realism novel i was expecting from Murakami; this felt more like a sci-fi/fantasy novel. I enjoyed how the characters were unnamed (I didn't realize it until over half way through the book though!) and I enjoyed the complex and altogether strange worlds that Murakami made between these two stories.The entire world with the Town was incredibly interesting - I think I would have preferred reading an entire story on just the Town and Dreamreader. The setting very much reminded me of Lois Lowry's "The Giver" with the utopian town that you can never leave, and how everything is perfect, except one person thinks its not. The idea of the shadows and "losing your mind" was very intriguing too, and I wish we'd had the 400pages to solely explore that world.The segments with the unnamed man, the chubby girl and the scientist were just strange and personally unsatisfying to me. It was also very confusing with the not-actual-science ramblings that made no sense.I recommend this for Murakami lovers (obviously) but I'm honestly not sure who else would enjoy this. People who aren't afraid to go into a book that doesn't totally make sense, can be quite bizarre and will have you questioning what exactly you're reading.I honestly didn't have very many tabs this time around. Overall this story was just not as appealing to me, though I did enjoy the ending of the Town timeline and it was a fascinating read - it just didn't connect to me as much as some of his other works have.There was one quote that stuck out to me though:"this Town is perfect. And by perfect, I mean complete. It has everything. If you cannot see that, then it has nothing. A perfect nothing. Remember this well. That is as much as anyone can tell you; the rest you must learn for yourself. Open your eyes, train your ears, and use your head. If a mind you have, then use it while you can." (page 86)
