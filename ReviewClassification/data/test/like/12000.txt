It's been a fair few years since I read this, decided on a re-read because I'm going to readThe Poetry and Politics of Allen Ginsbergsoon, so thought it was best to have a refresh.I read Howl and then listened to the main himself performing it, best way to do it. Everytime time he says "eli eli lamma lamma sabacthani saxophone cry that shivered the cities down to the last radio" it gives me goosebumps.One thing I noticed this time is that his poetry still angers people, still getting thumb downs on YouTube. What a guy!
