A mystery that lasts till the last page and ends with an unprecedented plot twist.One of the favorite books that I read in 2015. Nothing much can be said about the story or plot, or anything for that matter, without dropping a major spoiler. But trust me, it's bloody clever. Agatha Christie will leave you dazzled. One of her finest.Highly Recommended!
