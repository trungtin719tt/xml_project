We can see how is Mia's and Adam's life now...Adam is living in Holywood and he is in relationship with an actress!After a disastrous interview in New York his manager gives him the rest of the day off.And while he is walking around the city,he comes across to a concert performance of Mia.At the end of the performance Mia called him at the backstage.And like that begins one night together after three years which they were appart from each other.There is still chemistry between Adam and Mia!The story was short like the previous book and it focused on Adam.I loved how the story developed!I'm so sad that the series over :(( I will miss these characters!!Now I'm even more excited to see the movie for If I Stay!!!
