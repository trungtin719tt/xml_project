I hated this book for a long time. The opening is difficult to get through, and I needed to start reading it three times over the last few years just to build up enough momentum to get through it. No doubt about it, Sometimes a Great Notion is a difficult novel. But I also think it is a great novel. Once I got the hang of the stream of consciousness and how the narrator switches from character to character, I realized how worthy of a read this book is. And once I reached the middle of it I realized that I was reading a masterpiece.This is a book about men, what it means to be a man, issues of being a man etc. It is also about families, work, the North West, rivalry, individualism.... Kesey packs this book full of life.
