I received a free copy of this book in exchange for an honest review. Here it comes!This book was a complete surprise worthy of five stars for me. It was the type of situation where, rather than even reading the author's description of the book first, I jumped right in and let the story tell itself. I went in with no expectations, no single idea of what was going to unfold, and my goodness was I blown away.Robyn Mundell and Stephan Lacast do an excellent job of presenting this world so unfamiliar to humanity. Written in the first person point of view, we follow Bernard on his unexpected journey into his father's brain. Yes, you read that correctly: his journey into his father's brain, and this is where he finds out that his father needs some saving.Practically falling into an entirely different dimension within a dimension, science-loving Bernard goes from being ridiculed and criticized by everyone for being so impulsive and unrealistic to being surrounded by only impulsive and creative beings. This, of course, would be the right side of the brain, and the beings are called Holons. In the combination of science and the imagination, the entire Brainiverse was created in a way that not only indicates the clear creativity of the work, but the extensive research that was done for it.There is a war between the two sides of the brain over the possession of what is called Energeia, this being the source of thought and creation -- and if you want to get real deep on this, life as well. The right side of Bernard's father's brain has been very nearly wiped out. It certainly explains why his dad is so "left-brained," to say the least, but the entire plot leads to some excellent character development as well.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and would certainly recommend it to sci-fi lovers. Thanks so much for the great read!
