This review can also be found atCarole's Random Life.Anyone who knows me knows how much love I have for this series. I really enjoyed listening to this book. I have recently listened to the first four books in the series after having read them years earlier. This was the first time that I have experienced this book and I was a little nervous about listening to it instead of sitting down with a book but I think it worked out well in the end.So much happens in this book! That is really kind of normal for this series but this book has so many things going on. I guess that really should be expected since this book is also really long. It is like 3 or 4 books if you just compare page counts. There were a few sections of the book that I did think went on a little longer than was really needed. The book starts out at a gathering and I wasn't sure that they would ever leave but they did in the end and the book did start to really pick up steam quickly.All of the characters that I have grown to love over the years were back in this book. Jamie and Claire are getting a bit older and it is really nice to see watch them grow over the course of the series. It is refreshing to see a couple that have been married for a long time still have the passion and love that Jamie and Claire have for each other. Brianna and Roger go through a lot in this book. In a lot of ways this book isn't very kind to poor Roger. Jemmy is growing up and his personality really starts to shine through in this book.I really enjoyed the narration of this audiobook. I think that Davina Porter does a fabulous job with this series. In this book, she is able to give a unique voice to all four of the main characters. She is able to convey a lot of emotion during her narration. I found myself not wanting to stop listening because I had to know how things would work out.I would highly recommend this book to others but I do believe that this is a series that needs to be read in order so please start with Outlander. The ending of this book really was exciting for me and I came really close to moving directly into the next book in the series. I can't wait to read more about Jamie and Claire!Initial ThoughtsI feel like I deserve some kind of reward for finishing this audiobook in a month. 55 1/2 hours is looong!This book started out slow for me but picked up eventually. There were a lot of new developments and some heartbreaking moments. The last part of the book was fascinating. I can't wait to read more of Jamie and Claire but I will probably take a break for a bit first.
