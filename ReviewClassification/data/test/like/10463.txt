"Today I have gathered together my nearest and dearest, my sixteen nieces and nephews...I, Samuel W. Westing, hereby swear that I did not die of natural causes. My life was taken by me-by one of you!...Cast out the sinner, let the guilty rise and confess. Who among you is worthy to be the Westing heir?"16 UNLIKELY HEIRS ON THE HUNT OF A MURDERER AMONG THEM?The Westing Game begins.I never would have thought that this is a children's book. Because honestly, the ingenuity of the plot transcends all age-bracket genres.THIS IS A MASTERPIECE.Sure this isn't really perfect but danggg son,IT'S THE FCKING TWISTS THAT DID ME.At first I just read on without giving any thought about the "murderer" then by the latter part I'm going to piece off one theory, then it get's utterly crushed, and OH! here's another more plausible one, harharrr wrong again! Wait, I'm so sure that it is this one YAAAY, uhmm nope. Then BOOM everything is laid out perfectly right under my nose.What I loved about this book aside from the eye-catching plot, is how these 16 heirs were fleshed out vividly and had developed by the end of the book. I was satisfied that we readers still get to see these 16 heirs grow and age. YES. The conclusion gave us glimpses of their futures in snippets even after The Westing Game had finally resolved. I just love these endings.Overall, this book was filled with humor and witty dialogues. I loved how I pined for the right character! HAAHHA. I recommend this to everyone who wants a fast yet enjoyable mystery book. Definitely one of my fave books this 2018.P.S. I just bought this for 25 pesos in Booksale and I swear, this is the greatest Booksale find I'd ever had in my whole reading career.
