Just short of four stars, but worth rounding up. My first Discworld book, and admittedly it took a while to get used to his writing style, (no chapters, and frequent movement from one storyline to another after brief passages). Overall I found this to be clever, entertaining, and quite imaginative, with some interesting underlying messages. Didn't hook me on the series, but every fantasy reader should experience at least one Discworld book. I was not disappointed withHogfather.
