A true inspirational story about broken hearts and lost souls, the golden thread that holds them together and yes..belief. Belief in oneself.A horse, trained to lose right from its birth. Lose so that others can look good when they win. Lose, so that when they win, they can look back and see others way behind. A horse, which has learned to live with pain and humiliation. A horse, which is angry. It is this horse that catches the eye of Tom Smith, a veteran horse trainer employed under Charles Howard, a broken industrialist who has lost his young son. Tom Smith realizes what the horse has been put through to and begins to heal it and make it start believing in itself. Enters Red Pollard, a loser jockey employed under Charles Howard too. The story then moves on to the relationship that Red Pollard and the horse share, the way they start to heal each other and what common things they find between themselves.Beautifully written and amazingly uplifting!
