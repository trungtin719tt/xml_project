My favorite Dan Brown novel.Just like his Robert Langdon series this is sometimes a little silly but, like the better Langdon novels, it's also a lot of page-turning fun.It's about NASA's discovery of a meteorite in the Arctic ice which seems to contain evidence of extraterrestrial life. This would be a huge success for NASA after years of failure.It also comes at a time of presidential election and with the current President and his challenger Senator Sexton having different stances as to what to do with NASA.The discovery of the meteorite therefore becomes part of political powerplay in Washington and Sexton's daughter who's working for the NRO gets caught up in it.She's sent to the Arctic along with oceanographer Michael Tolland and some other scientists and, suffice it to say, things do not go as planned and soon people are either running for their lives or searching for the truth or both.The themes of that story are much more appealing to me compared to the other Dan Brown novels I've read. And this makes me much more willing to give him a pass for some of his cheap tricks and the odd scene that requires the suspending of disbelief.4.5 starsI had a lot of fun with this book and in fact do still rank it among my favorites.
