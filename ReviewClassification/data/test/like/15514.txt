"Alone, alone, all, all alone,Alone on a wide wide sea !And never a saint took pity onMy soul in agony.The many men, so beautiful!And they all dead did lie:And a thousand thousand slimy thingsLived on ; and so did I.I looked upon the rotting sea,And drew my eyes away;I looked upon the rotting deck,And there the dead men lay.I looked to heaven, and tried to pray;But or ever a prayer had gusht,A wicked whisper came, and madeMy heart as dry as dust.I closed my lids, and kept them close,And the balls like pulses beat ;For the sky and the sea, and the sea and the skyLay like a load on my weary eye,And the dead were at my feet.The cold sweat melted from their limbs,Nor rot nor reek did they:The look with which they looked on meHad never passed away.An orphan's curse would drag to hellA spirit from on high;But oh! more horrible than thatIs the curse in a dead man's eye!Seven days, seven nights, I saw that curse,And yet I could not die."
