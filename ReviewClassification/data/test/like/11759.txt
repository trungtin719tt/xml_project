Damn, but I love the 'redemption' genre! I'm sure there's an official genre title, but that's what I call it. You know the deal: 'Shawshank Redemption', 'A Million Little Pieces', 'Shantaram'....The protagonist is thrown into jail (or a mental institution)... often on a drummed up charge. Fighting tooth and nail to survive incarceration with the spirit intact, hungering to escape and punish those who put them there to begin with.OR the book starts right after the jail-break, and the protag wants nothing more but to turn a new leaf and live an upstanding life. But the law won't forget and keeps trying to pull them back into the jaws of spirit-crushing imprisonment...France has produced some of the best revenge/redemption tales of all time: 'The Count of Monte Cristo'--'Les Miserables'--and this last, 'Papillon', combines the best of jail-break, jail-life, revenge and the burning, unquenchable spirit to survive. At times, I could swear the book was pulsating in my hands, like a bloody heart....In 1931, Henri Charriere (also known as Papillon) is convicted of murder on a false charge and sentenced to life in prison, with an added ten years of hard labor to be served on a penal colony in French Guiana, off the north coast of South America. Convicted in his mid-twenties, he will spend the next decade of his life trying again and again to escape. An adventure story, a diary of incarceration (from the community of the prison yards to the soul entombment of solitary), a scathing criticism of a civilized country's lack of compassion for those who stray from the law--I found myself unable to put it down. What's more, it is a memoir--Memoirs are always tricky affairs. There comes a time inevitably in a memoir where you're like, no. Come ON. That did NOT happen. Get the fuck OUT. After 500+ pages with more than ten jail breaks, countless shivings in the shower, a half-year stint in the wilderness, superhuman feats of survival, living as one with an indigenous tribe, shark attacks, leper colonies, and almost a combined four years of entirely solitary solitary confinement (not to mention a whole herd of beautiful brown women who for reasons, simply HAD to have their breasts tattooed by the protagonist, who was more than happy to oblige....) I had to ask myself how much of this memoir's memory's had been enhanced. Turns out quite a bit of controversy had broiled back in the day when it exploded as a best seller.The author himself claimed 75% as true.... others pegged that number much lower, but you know, I really don't care--the story is amazing, the writing is clear-cut, and there's nothing like an excellent 'redemption' book to get you up and fighting again when you're feeling sort of low.Found myself thinking, fuck, if THIS guy could escape a maximum security penal island surrounded by shark infested waters on a goddamn BARREL--maybe I can do something with my life too?Loved it!
