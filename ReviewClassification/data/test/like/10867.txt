The Silver Chair is a fascinating adventure story of the Chronicles of Narnia. After my disappointment over The Voyage of the Dawn Treader, I was a little apprehensive as to how I would receive it. But all my fears were groundless as the story held my interest from the first chapter.For the first time, we don't meet the Pevensies. Instead we meet Eustace, returned to Narnia with Jill Pole, a school friend of his. Although one misses Pevensies, the characters of Eustace and Jill who replace them do justice to the story and display enough bravery and courage.I really enjoyed the writing in this story. There was intrigue, suspense and humour. The minute and colourful description of the various places where the adventurers found themselves painted a true picture of the setting that one feels one is living in the story with all those characters. Also there was underlying satire which was quite a new experience.With this read I have finished six books of the Chronicles, and the Silver Chair is my second favourite, placed between The Lion, the Witch and The Wardrobe and Prince Caspian. Looking forward to the final read in the series and to complete the Chronicles.
