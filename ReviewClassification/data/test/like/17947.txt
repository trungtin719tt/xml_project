"Brainwalker" is the story of Bernard, a boy who is searching for a project in science, and accidentally travels through a wormhole into his dad's brain at his dad's work (his father works with an "atom smasher" or particle collider). His dad's brain contains an entire universe which is in trouble due to a lack of energeia (how neurons communicate).Overall, the book is cute and clever. Bernard's father has become too logical and so needs to enhance the artistic parts of his brain (which are lacking energeia). It contains some lessons about the brain such as about neurons and the corpus callosum connects the two hemispheres. This is a fun way for kids/preteens to learn about science and the brain. The pictures are also really great and add a lot to the story.The main flaw of the book is that it is based on the myth that the two sides of the brain are divided as logical (left) and artistic (right). This is a common misperception, but a myth nonetheless. I think it would have been better to use regions of the brain instead, such as that areas of the prefrontal cortex is logical and limbic system would be more emotional. This would make it more accurate and educational, but there are still lessons to be learned!Overall, I think this is a fun read and would be great for preteens/tweens especially.Please note that I received thus book from the publisher through netgalley in exchange for my honest review.
