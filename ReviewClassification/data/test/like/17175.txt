ReadingValley of the Dollsis akin to eating a pint of your favorite ice cream, in that it's wonderful and delicious down to the last bit, but it can come with a bit of a hangover if you start to think about what you just did.This is the story of Anne, Neely, and Jennifer, and their struggles to survive as women - women who want love, careers, a comfortable standard of living, etc., mostly in New York, but also in LA, and primarily in the stage and film businesses. It's gossipy, brutal, and funny all at once, and an absolute perfect beach-read page-turner.Where the hangover comes in is when you start to analyze the message, the themes. When you start to think of how cruel the world can be to women, how men use women, how women use each other. Your feelings about it might also depend on where you stand and how you feel about the idea of "having it all."Valley of the Dollsseems to argue that you very much can't - you can't have a great marriage, a great job, and be a great mother - at times you might be lucky to have even one of those things. And the relationship with feminism is weird, too - is it making the argument that the freedom of sexual liberation and workplace opportunities has back-fired on women? It feels like it might be, but I couldn't tell you, and I honestly don't want to dwell on it too much.So no, I wouldn't recommend analyzingValley of the Dollsin any way, honestly. It's just not that kind of read. This is what you pick up when you're in the mood for something deliciously campy, a page-turning drama, and I mean that in the best of ways. The world needs those books too, or at least I know I do.Edit, Oct. 2015:I finally saw the movie, and it's nottttttt great, but worth a watch if you like bad-cheesy dramas. Didn't quite have the emotional heft that the book managed to, but it was an amusing way to spend a sick day. The one thing I'll give it over the novel is that I did like the ending more.
