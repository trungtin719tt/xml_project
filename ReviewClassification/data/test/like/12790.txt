Someone please send some chocolate, a hug, and possibly some Irish scotch my way.I think I'm dying.If I'm not dead already, that is.It's half past midnight, I'm an ugly sobbing mess and I think that noise I just heard was either my soul ascending to another dimension or my heart -or what's left of it-breaking in my chest.I feel nothing but numbness right now, though, so it could easily be both.I hate this book so much.It touched me in some very sensitive spots, rubbed its salty and bookish paws against wounds that are still too fresh for it to not hurt like hell.I hate it with the burning passion of someone who's lived through something similar and felt the same kind of pain deep within their bones.I hate it because it did nothing but remind me of how necessary it is, sometimes, to deal with the monsters we carry around in order to feel better with ourselves and the world that surrounds us.I've never read anything nearly as awfully beautiful as this story is. The way it's written, the timing, the darkness behind the words.Everything is so perfect and it hurts so bad it's almost good.A devastating masterpiece. A glorious goodbye letter filled with tears and courage. A sharp and bleeding piece of heart disguised as a 200-something-page novel.I wish I'd read it sooner, I wish I never did.I hate it, hate it, hate it and, at the same time, love every bit of it. Every line and every page, from my first breath to the last.Gosh, what a book.What.A.Book.And if no one sees you, are you really there at all?
