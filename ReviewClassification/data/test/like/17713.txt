A Readers' Favorite Review:Somewhere out there in the galaxy, a dark and evil force is waiting to annihilate humankind... and through the millennia, its purpose has been successfully averted. But its effort never stops. The Awakening: Fate in Motion is an ancient origin story, and how throughout history, we have been protected by enlightened beings from the dark force, Sar. It's a story of good vs. evil. Sar is coming... again. People who are unaware of their destiny suddenly find their lives changed as they are awakened to protect the Earth from this evil force that wants to end the world. Plots are uncovered and old secrets are revealed to the chosen ones who need to harken and fight off this evil force once again. They have no choice. Their fate is written in their genetic code. And it's now in motion.It's astounding that The Awakening: Fate in Motion is Suzanne Boisvert's debut novel. Right from the opening scene, I was hooked... by the flow of words and the way the author effortlessly introduced the characters and laid out the plot. Boisvert has a way with words. Her writing is fresh and unencumbered, the words flowing out of the pages and drawing me in.A hidden journal by the American president, FDR, confirming the presence of the aliens and their purpose, was gripping. As I turned the pages, I was excited to see what the author will come up next. We have a history we do not know, and I believe that. The author fed my fascination with this topic. Conspiracies, the Knighs Templar, Special abilities hidden in our genes... Scifi fans and those interested in esoteric knowledge will have so much fun reading this book. I look forward to more titles from this author. Highly recommended!
