One of my favorite Agatha Christie stories. I read this book, have watched the movie hundreds of times, but now I wanted to hear the audio. The BBC radio dramatizations are unique and take some getting used to. The first BBC adaptation I listened to, I did not care for it. There are a lot of people for the various characters, there are background noises, and music. But this one I really enjoyed. It feels like I'm listening to a play or movie.....without seeing anything.The most fascinating part of the one for me is Egypt. A slow boat ride down the Nile, visiting various sites, all along with Mr. Hercule Poirot. As a child reading this one, I dreamed of visiting Egypt. This book has intrigue, jealousy, travel, mystery, murder, a cast of characters, ...all the classic formulas in a Christie book. A great book for those wanting to try out a Christie book. For audio lovers, a great adaptation worth listening to for a few short hours.
