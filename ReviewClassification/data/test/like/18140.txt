The next stop in my time travel marathon (November being Science Fiction Month) wasTimeline, Michael Crichton's 1999 thriller. Crichton was not what I think of as a prolific writer; he published sixteen novels in his lifetime under this own name, beginning in 1969 withThe Andromeda Strain. Perhaps the movies produced from most of these titles make it seem like Crichton was everywhere. I'd like to think that maybe the author devoted the time between novels conducting backbreaking research. WithTimeline, he certainly lays the groundwork all other time travel tales should build from.The story takes off wondrously in northern Arizona of the present day with a couple roaming the Navajo Indian reservation in their Mercedes. The wife is in search of authentic handcrafted rugs and as her husband drives further away from civilization, tension mounts. An old man appears on the road out of nowhere and falls to the ground as the Mercedes passes. The couple take the incoherent man to a hospital, where he dies of an apparent cardiac arrest. A Navajo police officer and a surgeon discover the old man is a missing materials physicist working for ITC Research in Black Rock, NM.The cop and the surgeon note strange things about the dead physicist. An MRI exam shows arteries and muscle issue that appear offset, perhaps a glitch in the imaging software. He was carrying a diagram for the Monastery of Sainte-Mere in France, as well as a plastic marker which ITC claims was an ID tag. What was he doing wandering in the desert? These questions concern the 38-year-old founder of International Technology Research, billionaire physicist Robert Doniger, who dispatches the company's legal counsel to southwestern France, where an ITC archeological dig is taking place on the Dordogne River.Doniger is anxious for the Dordogne group -- led by Yale history professor Edward Johnston -- to initiate reconstruction of the site, which in addition to the monastery, includes the fortresses of Castlegard and La Roque, burned to the ground after Sir Oliver de Vannes lost them to French forces in 1357, some say, when a traitor opened a secret passage. While Johnston, assistant history professor Andre Marek, physicist David Stern and grad students Chris Hughes and Kate Erickson have taken their time reassembling the ruins, they're puzzled by the precise nature of the architectural data coming from ITC.While Johnston returns to Black Rock to find out what's going on, his team make an alarming discovery: an eyeglass lens that's been in the dirt for over 600 years and a message in parchment that appears to be in the professor's handwriting. It readsHELP ME, 4/7/1357. Marek, Stern, Hughes and Erickson are whisked to Black Rock, where Doniger's second-in-command explains that while time travel is not possible, ITC has utilized quantum physics to pioneer a type of space travel, sending observers through a wormhole to another part of the multiverse, where 1357 France is happening right now.Doniger explains that while ITC has been sending ex-soldiers into the multiverse and retrieving them for two years, rules prohibit them from stepping into the world of the past. Professor Johnston apparently broke this rule and has disappeared. Marek, a physically fit specimen with training in Occitan language as well as swordplay, agrees to join the rescue, as do Erickson and reluctantly, Hughes. Stern has reservations about the safety of the quantum technology, as well Doniger's promise that with two trained soldiers for protection, the group should be able to locate the professor and return within two hours. Stern remains behind to observe.When the author ofWestworldandJurassic Parktells you that an exciting new technology that will change mankind is perfectly safe -- Doniger envisions global historical sites that can send observers into the past, and of course, engineers have worked out all the kinks -- you not only walk away, you run.Timelinedid remind me of a certain dinosaur-run-amok thriller, to its credit, as well as its detriment.Timelineis impeccably researched. I know next-door-to-nothing about quantum physics, but Crichton has such immense game that from beginning to end, I was convinced that he knew what the hell he was talking about. Crichton devotes awesome attention to justhowa tech company might send a human being across time and retrieve them. The team he assembles for this mission is expertly considered as well: historians, physicists and soldiers for hire, whose combat training turns out to be antithetical to exploring history.The sequence which leads to the rescue party being stranded in 1357 occurs at roughly the same moment the T-Rex attack occurs inJurassic Parkand is almost as memorable, with existential crisis, sudden violence and unbelievable shock. I also liked the way Crichton utilized history, with the Hundred Years War, England and France's bloody rivalry and even women's rights playing important functions in the story. The author examines how each character is unprepared for some aspect of the 14th century, whether the speed of swordplay or the pleasing aromas of the castles.From an anthropological standpoint -- what would a team of historians experience if they traveled to 1357 France --Timelinehas no equal. Technically, the novel is flawless. Dramatically, the development of characters leaves a lot to be desired. Marek, Hughes and Erickson are given only the barest traits (The Hot Dog, The Chicken, The Athlete). The Professor is, well, The Professor. Doniger is The Evil Billionaire.While I could accept traveling through the multiverse, one thing I found difficult to buy were the number of times the protagonists escape certain death. It seemed like Hughes was nearly killed every five pages. Erickson runs for her life every ten pages. The 14th century is an age that Crichton illustrates as being overrun by death, and yet, these two rejects from a Gap commercial somehow keep surviving. There is no logical reason for it; Hughes and Erickson leap from one pitfall to the next because the plot dictates it.The novel wraps up in a predictable and rather glib fashion that I didn't care much for. Then again, each of these criticisms could be leveled againstJurassic Park, with characters who force little outcome in the story and survive much longer than they had any reason to. Crichton is not breaking new ground here. If you're looking for strong characters and dialogue to match the technological coolness, you'll probably hate this. If you loved his past work, you'll probably love this. I'm giving it three and a half stars, rounded up to four stars.Timelinesurpassed expectations in part due to how poorly received the 2003 film adaptation was. Gerard Butler, Frances O'Connor and Paul Walker starred as Marek, Erickson and Hughes and may have dialed in performances due to how gorgeous but wooden their characters were supposed to be. The pleasures of the novel are in the anthropological discoveries happening in the minds of the characters, none of which translate to film very well. The physical action -- sieges, swordfighting, foot chases -- was filmed with much more imagination inThe Lord of the Ringstrilogy.
