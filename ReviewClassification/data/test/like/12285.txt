The Sookie Stackhouse books are definitely not great literature by any means, but they're a bit like candy--hard to stop reading and very enjoyable. This third book was more of the same, and while there were times I wanted to slap Sookie (even though she gets beat up a number of times in here...again. What's with Charlaine Harris's obsession with beating the snot out of Sookie all the time, anyway?), I really enjoyed reading this.The main thing I liked was actually the introduction of werewolves into the world, since up until now they've been a mysterious thing that no one really talks about. I've always been more partial to werewolves than vampires, so it was nice for me to be able to finally see how they fit into the world of Sookie.I alsoreallyliked Alcide as a character, and hope to see more of him later in the series. Less of Bill more of Eric and Alcide would be a good thing to me, Bill just doesn't interest me as much as he's probably supposed to.So far I'm really enjoying this series, but I think I'll take a break here so as not to bet burnt out on them all.
