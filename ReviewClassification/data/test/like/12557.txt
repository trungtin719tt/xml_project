This ebook has been in my Nook library since I downloaded it for free from Barnes in Noble, about October 2010. It is part of the Barnes and Noble Classics. Kipling originally published two Jungle Books in 1894 and 1895. I enjoyed reading the extra materials too.These stories are not the Disney version. The stories remain entertaining and thought-provoking.I encourage all readers to enjoy this classic.
