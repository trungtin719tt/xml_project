well, i read the book ages ago and it left such an impression that when i signed up for bookface i stamped the sucker with a fiver. the gothsissy promises if i re-read it i'll knock off a few stars. whatever.i saw the movie last night and a word popped into my head:smimsicholy: a specific combination of smug-whimsy-melancholy seen in the work of certain 'important' artists and/or entertainers.yeah. if sam mendes is the cinematic anti-christ than this movie's his mastercheese. it's a laughable piece of bourgeois chest-beating. precious and maudlin and false. and it covers the unholy trinity (smug/whimsical/melancholy) while somehow managing to create even more of an abomination out of the sum of its parts.the bush era saw some very good american films and i think one of the best, and perhaps the one that will most define our time, isthere will be blood. and i fear the obama age is gonna produce a lot of smimsicholic nonsense.i see that dave eggers (the king of literary smimsicholy) and his wife vendela vida (never read her but her name just reeks of it) wrote the screenplay for mendes' next movie. and it looks dreadful. check it:http://www.apple.com/trailers/focus_f...revolting.i'm not really such a prick. this shit just makes me freak out a little bit.
