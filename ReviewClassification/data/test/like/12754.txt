Mark Twain once said that the two most fascinating people of the 19th century were Napoleon and Helen Keller. I've yet to read anything on Napoleon but I can feel the fascination with Helen.This edition was in three parts. The first is a series of installments originally written for the Ladies Home Journal in 1902. Serial installments just don't strike me really well. Or it could just be that Helen Keller does not give herself credit to the person she became. Later I realized that it's the words that she doesn't say that say the most.Helen if you do not know is both blind and mute. She writes better than most people and thinks more than most people. She wanted to do everything that everyone else did ... learn to talk, go to college ... and never did brag about it. Three's a quiet determined ... innocent strength about her. I've written about a load bravado of a strength within us that brandishes a sword in the middle of a bloodstained battlefield. There's the patient energy wisdom of an elder. Then there's Helen ... innocent and determined. Not knowing her limitations she has exceeded our expectations.Her letters filled the second part of the book. One must smile when watching the learning curve of her first letters to the advanced letters at the end.The final part Anne Sullivan writes her version. I appreciate Helen more after listening to Anne's version. Anna gives us some contrast to Helen against the world that we understand.Beautiful book about a beautiful person.
