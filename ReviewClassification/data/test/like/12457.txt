Wow. I'd forgotten quite how amazing a writer is Mr. Kurt Vonnegut.The Sirens of Titanis his second novel, and already his voice is developed to its peak: the irony, the cynicism, the repetition, the bleakness, the heartbreaking.This book moved me more than his other works. Something about these sad, lonely and powerless characters fighting their fates in a dark, unfeeling cosmos. It is a bleak, emotionally resonant work, far more moving thanSlaughterhouse 5orBreakfast of Champions.You can also see how influential this book was on Douglas Adams. The Hitchhikers Guide series, one might argue, is a whimsical offshoot of this novel.A classic. Easily in his top three novels.
