I loved the movie with Tom Hanks, so thought the book would be excellent. It was good, but quite different. The movie certainly held true to the overall theme, but did it better, IMO. The first third of the book was fantastic. The middle third wasn't very good, but the last third picked back up &amp; the ending was fantastic. Still, this was well worth reading. It was quick, thoughtful, &amp; had me laughing out load several times.If you're easily offended, this book isn't for you since this is written in the vernacular.The book opens with "LET ME SAY THIS: BEIN A IDIOT IS NO BOX OF CHOCOLATES. People laugh, lose patience, treat you shabby."Forrest tells it like it is from his point of view which is a stripped down version of what most of us see &amp; pretty free of preconceptions &amp; judgements. A person can be a spasmo, colored, or many less savory names, but that's just the best word he knows that fits. Put your own verbal prejudices aside &amp; just let the words flow. Forrest does &amp; things generally work out pretty well for him.The other people that play on the ping-pong team are real nice fellers what come from ever walk of life, an they is specially nice to me. The Chinamen is nice, too, an they is very different sorts of gooks from what I seen in Vietnam. First off, they is neat an clean an very polite. Second, they is not tryin to murder me.Forrest's opinion of the Vietnam War:"Look, I am jus a idiot, see. But if you want my real opinion, I think it was a bunch of shit."And, of course,"I got to pee."Never have 4 words wreaked so much havoc, generally for good as they cut through the crap. They're a punchline throughout the book.Definitely worth reading, highly recommended. I see that it is one of a series, but I'm not interested &amp; won't shelve it as part of one. This stood alone for around a decade &amp; it will continue to do so in my mind. Anything more would just spoil it.
