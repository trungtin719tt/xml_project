I'm a sucker for a good story with time travel or reincarnation... I see a book with those themes and I snatch it up if I have the funds. There's just something about them :)This one was on the good side... around page 240 or so it dragged for awhile but picked right back up. Other than that little blip, it kept my attention quite nicely and made me smile when I thought about Sam revisiting his memories and having doubts as to whether it was him or Keel.I remember saying to him in my head "Don't think too hard on time travel, you'll only get a migraine"The time travel parts were handled nicely, it made sense... as much it can in this type of thing, and wasn't too outlandish, staying true to the "ground rules" it laid out. The one end bit with Sam when he came back. and the wizard was hilarious.Glad Carcer's fate was what I hoped it was and Vetinari... love that bastard :)Well done again Mister Pratchett! Can I go to Ankh-Morpork and join the Watch? Sounds like fun ;-)Would recommend, happy reading!
