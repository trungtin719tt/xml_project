I quite enjoyed Riordan's new adventures featuring the Kane siblings, Carter and Sadie (I believe 14 and 12 years of age... though I thought Sadie seemed older), who are introduced to the possibilities that Egyptian mythology may be a bit more real than they realized.Sadie and Carter's mother died when they were young, and since then they have had to live apart - Sadie with her mother's parents in London, and Carter with his father, traveling the world looking for Egyptian artifacts. Since they only see each other once a year or so, it nicely adds to the story to have their relationship develop and evolve.When visiting the museum something goes terrible wrong, and Carter and Sadie discover that there may be more to their father, and the Kane family, than they realized.I listened to the audio book, which I thought was wonderful! It is narrated by Kevin R. Free and Katherine Kellgren. Because the story is told both by Carter and Sadie, each narrator reads the appropriate section. The book is very suited to an audio recording, as it is supposed to be Carter and Sadie making a recording of the events that have transpired.I enjoy the Percy Jackson books, and I think that this book has a similar style, a similar since of fun and lightness, but happily it didn't feel the same, like I was reading the same story just with differently named characters. To me, Red Pyramid felt a little more mature and complex (not in a bad way, just in that the protagonists are older, there's more history, details, etc.). I enjoyed this, and - like the Percy Jackson books with Greek mythology - The Red Pyramid made me intrigued with Egyptian mythology and history (the author's note, by the way, is fantastic!).Also, it was very nice and refreshing to have the Kane siblings be mixed race, with a black father and white mother. Not only does this bring about some interesting sibling points (since Carter is darker and Sadie lighter they are often not perceived to be brother and sister) but I also thought Riordan handled it all really well, not making a big deal about, letting the story still be the story, but with a few mentions here and there where this is mentioned.I'm hoping that there will be more to this series, and I'm anxiously awaiting reading the rest - I mean, what's not to love with dueling avatar half-man-half-bird forms, wands and staffs, and a protective cat?
