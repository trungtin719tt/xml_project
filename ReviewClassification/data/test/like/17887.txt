Trigger warnings: death, murder, violence.28/11/2018I love everything about this. EVERYTHING. Especially the peeing pig and how long that joke is dragged out for. It's spectacluar.25/12/2017Yes, I reread this even though I'd just finished it in January. Whatever. It's amazing and I love it.21/1/2017I ran out of time to reread this in 2016, so I got in early this year. There is so much INCREDIBLY clever writing in here that makes you think about yourself and your beliefs. There are so many fabulous characters. There are so many iconic moments ("meet the Hogfather at the fancy department store" turning into "watch the Hogfather's enormous hogs piss all over the fancy department store", for one). And honestly? It's just a delight.26/12/2015I've adored Terry Pratchett's Discworld series for nearly 20 years now, but in the past year or so, I've gained a new appreciation for the subtleties of his writing. Yes, this is hilarious. And yes, it's incredibly entertaining. But there is SO much in this story about belief, about the impact that belief has on children, about how the things we're told as children - "don't suck your thumb, or the Scissor Man will come and cut it off!", "don't step on a crack in the footpath or a bear will eat you!", "be careful or the bogeyman will get you!" - impact on our lives as adults, as well as throughout childhood.There's also a lot about belief being full of layers - the Hogfather ultimately comes from the idea that a midwinter sacrifice is necessary for the sun to return. So what starts as a pagan tradition gets warped and changed through the years and through the generations until somehow it pops out the other end as a fat jolly man who gives presents to small children.In short, you can read Pratchett at a surface level and laugh yourself silly. Or you can look a little deeper, and be blown away by just how much of a genius Pratchett really was.19/12/2013I adore this book with every fibre of my being. It's one of my favourite Discworld books, hands down. And it was the perfect Christmas reread - while it may be deeply funny and highly entertaining, at its core, Hogfather is a story about the power and importance of belief.Susan and Death are two of my favourite Discworld characters, and it's completely wonderful to have them both throughout so much of this book. Oddly, despite loving the book to pieces, I really wasn't a big fan of the TV adaptation from a couple of years ago. I'm just not convinced that they can ever quite capture the magic of Death and the spirit of Hogswatch on television, you know?If for no other reason, this is worth reading for the scene where Death takes over as a department store Hogfather. His conversations with the kids in the store are completely priceless, the reactions of the parents are hilarious, and the unexpected addition of Nobby Nobbs is simply the icing on the cake of awesomeness.
