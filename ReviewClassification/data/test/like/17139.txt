Re-read for POPSUGAR Challenge: A book you loved as a child. The stories are so funny and the pictures are awesome. I read this countless times as a child. Still the best!~~~~~Added April 9, 2014 - My brothers bought me this book for Christmas when I was about 10. Such a great, funny twist on familiar fairy tales!
