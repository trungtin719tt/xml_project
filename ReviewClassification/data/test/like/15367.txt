Loved it!Like Hemingway, I love Paris from the bottom of my heart. And like him, I was lucky enough to spend some time there as a 22-year-old university student. I remember the feeling when I got off the train, knowing I had months of P-A-R-I-S ahead, and how precious each minute felt. I remember walking the streets, stopping to gaze into shop windows, to have coffee, or to browse bookstores. And I remember reading all those wonderful authors who had made Paris their home, feeling connected to them by the location I had chosen for myself. Among them - Hemingway!If Paris became my moveable feast, something I carry with me to this day, Hemingway became the voice to express that strange kind of love story that exists between human beings and cities.Long after my magical summer in Paris, while I still lived in the heart of Europe, I used to go to Paris at least twice a year, to the spring and the autumn exhibitions in the Grand Palais. I loved the autumn one more than the one in the spring, and there is absolutely nothing comparable to a rainy October day in Paris:"You expected to be sad in the fall. Part of you died each year when the leaves fell from the trees and their branches were bare against the wind and the cold, wintery light. But you knew there would always be the spring, as you knew the river would flow again after it was frozen. When the cold rains kept on and killed the spring, it was as though a young person died for no reason."The sadness Hemingway mentions is one of sweetest feelings I know: it encompasses the essence of Paris, - its strange melancholy beauty!It has been two years since I last took my children to the city, and in the growing October darkness, I can feel the longing, the need, the desire to go soon ... I want to take the moveable feast of my memory back to its origin again - and Hemingway will be in my hand luggage!
