I am a 40-something mom falling for YA fiction all over again. Pretties is not as fast-paced as Uglies, but this second installment in the series made me more emotionally involved overall, and made me care more for Tally and the other characters by the end of the book. Be patient with the slower parts--it will build soon and surpass your expectations. Scott Westerfeld is brilliant at creating this superficial world and characters, who have created their own future-language. The ending has the perfect cliffhanger, leaving you waiting for Specials...
