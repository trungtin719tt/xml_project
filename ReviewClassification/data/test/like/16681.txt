Just an amazing book. My expectations were sky high for this book. The Throne of Glass has been one faverite series in a long time. Every book seemed to get better and better. With these kinds of high hope I was just though this book would let me down somewhere. The only let down is the book is finished and I can't wait for the next one. It not only lived up to my expectations but sapassed them. One thing I will put a note on is there is a lot more explicit passages both in language and scenes. An example unlike the other book where SJM would write "a string of curses sprang from her lips", in this one it is the flat out curses. I have no problem with this but be warned for younger readers.So much of this book talks about how powerful Aelin is and can become, but it also a reminder of how brilliant she is. There are revelations galor. There are twist and turns and return. This story kept me gripped from beginning to end. Just when I though I had everything figured out it changed again. Also every character/member of "the court" had a chance to shine.This book just has it all, great characters, great character development, great writing that made me want to just devour chapter after chapter to the point I did not want to put it down during the finale. All this and bucket loads of action. Great continuity in the series, tying together many of the plots lines that were left in not the the other books but the novellas as well. What can I say when a book that is almost 700 pages leaves me wishing for another 700 pages it must be good.
