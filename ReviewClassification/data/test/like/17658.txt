Wow! That was some deeply disturbing and super depressing stuff. I'm thinking this was somewhere between a 3 1/2 and a 4 star read for me. This one will take some time to digest. In fact, as I write this review days later I'm still not sure exactly what to make of this story.Lochan and Maya have been forced to grow up too quickly. As the oldest, these two siblings have had to take on the responsibility of raising their three younger siblings. Their drunken, deadbeat mother breezes in and out of their lives when she chooses, leaving all of the day to day responsibilities up to her two oldest children. As a result, Lochan and Maya have a relationship that more closely resembles that of a husband and wife than that of a brother and sister.Since I knew where this story was heading from the start, I wasn't surprised at all when the siblings' relationship started to take on a more romantic feel. However, I was incredibly surprised when I found myself rooting for them as a couple. Going into this book, part of me had convinced myself that they were going to be step-siblings or half-siblings or some other relation that would somehow lessen the taboo nature of their relationship. That wasn't the case and I had to deal with some very uncomfortable feelings. It was so wrong, but they were just so damn right for each other at the same time.Okay, I know what you're thinking. You'd be right too. Awkward, right? I'm going to get it out and just say what we're all thinking, "Ew!" I'm not going to try and deny that this was some seriously messed up stuff. Just the thought of incest makes me cringe. To say the least, this was a very uncomfortable read as a result.Nonetheless, I found myself hoping that Lochan and Maya would somehow get a HEA. Even as I knew it was totally improbable, I wanted them to be happy. No teenagers ever deserved happiness more than these two. They bore the weight of the world on their shoulders. Right to the end, they sacrificed for their younger siblings.Of course, this is not that kind of story. This is the type of story that you go into knowing that it will break your heart...and it does. I cried big, fate tears and probably went through half a box of Kleenex while reading this story.Aptly titled, 'Forbidden' is taboo and controversial. While I won't try to justify incest, consensual or not, I will say that this story was a heartbreakingly beautiful love story. You will fall in love with each of the siblings, as you hate their worthless mother. You'll respect Lochan and Maya for their strength and dedication to their family. You will feel their love, anger, and desperation, even as you curse the injustice of it all. No way around it, you will FEEL while reading this story.As much as anything else, this story made me feel conflicted. I usually don't waver much in my convictions. However, this book made me question my values and morals. I found myself pondering "what if" more than I was comfortable with. Days later, I have to say that this story still has me feeling unsettled.Will it make you highly uncomfortable? Yes. Would I recommend it? Absolutely! In my opinion, the books that challenge the status quo and make me look at life through a different lens are the best kinds of books. Agree or disagree, but consider alternate viewpoints. Books like this aren't necessarily there to change what you believe, so much as they are there to make you examine why you believe what you do and consider other perspectives. Are there situations in which there should be exceptions to some steadfast rules of morality? This book will make you think about that type of thing.
