Go Dog Go is an exciting tale about a dog on his journey through life. It encompasses all of the major obstacles we confront in our modern western society from his first period to a heart attack at thirty. Most of the text requires use of a dictionary however if you have an internet connection available then looking up the more obscure words becomes a snap. Overall, I found the overarching message of this masterpiece insightful and full of ethically sound judgments. I would without question recommend this book to anyone looking for a critical self examination of one's self and or a substitute for toilet paper.
