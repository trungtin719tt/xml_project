So I actually threw this book across the room when I finished it. I was frustrated and upset and god dammit, I neededmoreexcept there wasn't any more to be had. Cliffhanger City. Again! AAARGH!!!It's a good thing my husband is a sound sleeper, although it did startle both the cats (who've started sleeping with us again now that it's getting chilly at night). And after recovering from my childish burst of emotion, I had to heave my big, pregnant belly out of bed, waddle across the room, bend over (which is soooo awkward that I normally try to avoid it as much as possible these days), pick it up and then crawl back into bed so I could reread the last chapter for clues about what the hell just happened. I wound up rereading that chapterfour times in a rowand I'm not any closer to knowing than I was after the first time. I have some theories but can just as easily talk myself out of them as I can talk myself into them.This was the fourth installment in a series of what will be five and just like last summer after the third came out, I'm left feeling a little strung out.Anyway, no "real" review from me and no spoilers. I can't recommend this series (and this author) enough to anyone who's a fan of any of the following: paranormal romance, dark urban fantasy and fairies.This series is so addictive. I love it!
