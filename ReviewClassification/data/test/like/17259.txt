My word. This was amazing. How come I haven't read this before now? When you think of Lewis you think of the Chronicles of Narnia, probably Mere Christianity, and The Screwtape Letters. But, over the years I've been trying to delve into some of his other works. And after reading this, I'll have to say Lewis might be my favorite author. The guy's imagination was just simply off-the-hook good. And he used such artistry to cloak his presentations. And I love that they don't need to be these big fat tomes either. Pith comes in small portions.You will never view heaven and hell (and those who occupy them) the same after reading this account. And using George MacDonald as your tour guide? That was smooth. Dante had his Virgil. Lewis had his MacDonald. And if I were to take a trip to heaven, I would request Lewis as my guide. I fully intend to tell him one day how much I enjoyed his works.
