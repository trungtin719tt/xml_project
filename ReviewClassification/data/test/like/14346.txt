I lovedeverypage of this book, including the hokey stuff.This is definitely comfort reading, but it's not chick lit and it's not oversimplified. It had enough plot complexity to keep my grown-up mind engaged. At the same time, it had enough enchantment and mystery to appeal to the little girl I once was. I was happy to discover that little girl is still in there, and she still believes in magical gardens and strange coincidences.This is a long and lovely story about a woman who made the wrong decision for the right reason, with consequences that echo down through the generations. Nell, Cassandra, and Eliza are separated by time, but joined by their individual experiences of loss and longing---and the mysteries that bind them together, which I won't tell! Juicy family secrets and fairy tales and a hint of ghostliness make for a really fun read.
