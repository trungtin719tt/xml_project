I thought this book was a lot like the movie, dark, depressing and bleak!This is the story of two types of drug addiction that takes place in Coney Island NY in the 1970's. One of the character is a young hoodlum who gets hooked on heroin and the other is a middle aged widow that gets hooked on pills (interestingly enough they are mother and son). I think at one point diet pills were pretty much like legalized speed but a doctor wrote the prescription, so what could be wrong, right? Turns out plenty.Both mother and son progressively sink deeper and deeper in to drug addiction with disastrous results. I liked how the author told the story of addiction from two very different viewpoints, it was also interesting to read about the heroin subculture in NYC at that time.Well written and a real good read!
