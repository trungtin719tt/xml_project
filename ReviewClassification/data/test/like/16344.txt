I'M DONE DONE DONE DONE DONE!!!! AND OMG. WHO AT THE END HAD BIPOLAR FEELS FOR SYDNEY!? I was about to kill the girl one second and then she ACTUALLY decides to use her brain and make mumma proud!!! WOOOT!!! :D FLAILY FANGIRLY REVIEW TO COME XD***********************************************************************Holy mother of all things good and sane...what is...what has the world come to?! I'm sorry, I know I'm supposed to be writing a sane review which will give you guys enlightening insight into the book, but, *scoffs*, that's not how this is going to go down AT ALL. First of all, I'm going to really quickly address the people who have read the book...*blank stare*, secondly, I'm going to address the people who haven't...WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU GUYS!? No, really, pick it up now because you honestly don't know what y'all are missing out on! Especially all you fellow Sydrian's out there! I never thought as this series went along that the books would get better, instead, I thought they'd lose the appeal they once had, but that's not the case at all. Richelle Mead once again manages to put together a helluva novel with just the right amount of suspense, mystery, magic, action, vampire delicousness, evil witchiness, AND romance! I don't know how she does it, but she has once again brewed together a hot and tasty bestseller! Well done, Miss Mead, well done.Once again, our main protagonist, Sydney Sage is back with a blast, but this time with a smexy sidekick (*cough* Adrian *cough*), and even more on her plate than a battle b/w good and evil. Not only does she have to deal with her witchy training, but also babysitting a bunch of "supposed" creatures that she'd been warned about her whole life, falling in love with one of them, battling evil witches, breaking long-held bonds, and basically having everything she's ever believed in come crashing down beside her. With an evil witch going around killing innocent girls, Syd's had to increase her witchly training. Her relationship with Adrian also grows more complicated with every steamy kiss. What she once thought was the truth, turns out to be a lie leading her to make a dangerous descision that will change her life forever. But of course, this is all in a day's work for Sydney Sage...Ok, I'm going to start off by saying that I might have a slight crush on Sydney Sage. Seriously. Lot's of people don't like her for some reason, but to me she's smart, helpful, and strong! Yes, she has the whole leaning-towards-anorexia aspect going on, but with each book this starts to become less and less severe. In this book, she actually eats PIE. YES. CALORIE-PACKED PIE. Huzzah for Sydney! Just like in Bloodlines and The Golden Lily, Syd is back with her awesome investigative skills and kick-ass moves. I adore her for always trying to help out the best she can with everything even though she has a lot on her plate; shows that the girl's up for any challenge. So overall, Sydney did not dissapoint me at all in this book, and that's a rare when it comes to the main character for me.Speaking of main characters, I, OF COURSE, have to bring up Adrian Ivashkov...*dreamy sigh*. He's on my top list of book boyfriends and always will be. Why? Because he has a great sense of humor, is poetic, protective, and...just...charming, yah dig? I honestly don't know what Rose DIDN'T see in him but did in Dmitri...eep, don't kill me, I know you can't help who your soulmate is, ha ha. Well anyway, thank god she didn't choose Adrian, because then we wouldn't have SYDRIAN *gasps at the thought*. Sydrian was as strong and funny as ever in TIS especially because they were basically stuck at the hip throughout the entire book, which, of course, I loved. Adrian played Robin to Syd's batman, and together, they were able to destory the joker, well in this case, evil witches (but there's really no difference). ALSO, and I warn you, some of the scenes in this book between Sydrian will be sure to send you guys through the roof so make sure you're tied securely to a chair! THE ROMANCE IN THIS BOOK WAS OFF THE DIGGY (yes...it deserves its own word).Characters? Check. Plot? Check plus. Romance? Check PLUS PLUS. I don't know how to put into words how flawless this book was to me. I thoroughly enjoyed it, laughed, loved, and lived through it, breathed it, worshipped it, and basically made it my adobe for the entire read. This series has not diasspointed me once and is slowly making its way into my top three favorites.I don't just recommend it, I INSIST (or else I'll shove it into your face...maybe...wellll...yah I think I will, ).
