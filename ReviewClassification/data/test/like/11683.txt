I've always liked science. But, it has never really been easy to distinguish my favorite subject, as I really like them all, so science is on par with history and math and literature for me.But, after reading this book and the works of Brian Greene, as well as numerous other popular books on physics, I have seen science in an entirely different light.If people could still produce intelligent books such as this one, then our world might actually be a fairly pleasant one. I'm not saying that we're all geniuses and can come up with our own mathematical theorems, but we should get a fairly good grasp of scientific ideas.This book, in short, takes a look at various positions on time throughout scientific history, ranging from Aristotle and Newton's idea of absolute time and space to Einstein's general theory of relativity.It's a bit of a dense read, so you'll have to read it carefully.
