This is one of those books that really will change your life, and it's one that absolutely should.Lindberg (the wife of Charles Lindberg) explores the necessity of not only looking inward, but of focusing on one's development in order to fully live as a person, a woman, a mother, and a wife. She is especially potent when discussing the necessity of occasional moments of solitude in order to realign one's priorities and give freedom to creative expression, rather than running oneself ragged with the million fragmented responsibilities of the American woman.This book was written in 1955, and it is even more relevant today. The text is anchored with a series of metaphors based on the shells that Lindberg collected over a 2 week retreat to the beach, and somehow the shells make perfect sense.In reading this I realized that I need to not only focus on continuing my own inner development for my own sake, but so that I can be an interesting woman, a mother more capable of giving, and a wife who will continue to grow with my husband rather than stagnate in the ceaseless pursuit of vital--but admittedly repetitive--household tasks.
