This was such a sweet book and a great look at family dynamics, siblings, friendships, and personal growth. I really enjoyed the well rounded MC and how Ruby is so far from perfect. This is a story about a flawed family and how you heal and learn to let love and other people into your life.I genuinely enjoyed the story and the character arc.
