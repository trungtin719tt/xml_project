This is probably the most accessible of Delillo's works, the one which I could pull off my shelf, dust off it's weathered skin, and hand to you, saying, "This is what the master does best." Or something a little less Masterpiece Theatre-y, but you get my drift.It also contains a single line that probably sums up his entire literary career: "All plots move deathward."Wikipedia talks about the book being a "absurdist family drama combined with academic satire." Yeah, that's a good start. Really, it's about a man who's bullshitted through most of his life, having been married five times, laughing at the world by becoming a professor of Hitler studies, who's scared of death. And who's scared of th way we're all scared of death. The post modern statistical way we live and live in wait of the end, when the simulacra runs out. With all of his books, bled into the plot is the way we choose media saturation and consumerism and novelty intellectualism and a love for conspiriacies as a valuable component of our lives. The way we kill time, I guess you could say.My suggestion: Read it. Especially if you haven't yet. If you have, that's awesome. Read it again. Read it to your family or someone laying in bed with you. Read it to a puppy or an autistic child on Christmas morning and then point to the turned off television and pantomime that you're changing the channels, and then read it to them again.
