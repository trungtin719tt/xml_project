I once went through a Dean Koontz phase, which involved me going to the bookstore and completely clearing an entire shelf's worth of Koontz paperbacks. I voraciously devoured (not literally, of course) them all in a relatively short span. (I'm pretty sure I missed a few meals and a shower or two.) What Koontz lacks in literary depth, he more than makes up for in readability, suspense, and just plain, old-fashioned good storytelling. "Watchers" was, hands down, my favorite of his mainly because the protagonist is a dog, and the most lovable dog-hero in all of horror fiction. (Die-hard horror fans know that there is a weirdly popular sub-genre of horror fiction in which dogs are the protagonists. I suppose it's completely understandable as to why the sub-genre is popular. Everyone loves dogs. People who don't like dogs are obviously evil.) I honestly can't remember much of the story, except that there is a monster, a man and a woman who meet within the first couple chapters and have fallen in love in by the last couple of chapters, and a psychotic government agent involved. Granted, that describes nearly ALL of Koontz's books, but so be it...
