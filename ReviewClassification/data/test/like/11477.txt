How many decades ago did I memorize this poem, "Tore open the shutters and threw up the sash...." Does any kid now hearing this know what a "sash" is, not to mention a chimney etc. "As dry leaves that before the wild hurricane fly...": now as we await the wet leaves--and yacht boating boots--of the Republicans at their national convention hall in Tampa, a full foot above sea level at least: has anyone ever seen DRY leaves flying before a hurricane?Sounds like someone from NY who has never seen a hurricane, possibly Clement Moore himself, possibly the one from whom some say he borrowed it.I have said it from memory to my kids and maybe one grandkid, though now whole swatches of it have washed down the drain with other hurricane detritus.There's a wonderful book by historian Stephen Nissenbaum on the growth of Santa over the long 19C, from a little man, the "right jolly old elf" of this 1822 offering, with his "stump of a pipe"--the remnant of a pottery pipe, a sign that this elf Santa was not properous--to the grand, well dressed and long-pipestemmed santas of today's bourgeois cards. In the poem, Santa is an intruder, the vestige of the old Christmas which was rather like our Halloween, with people coming to the door for chestnuts for a carol--not very different from beggars. In the poem, Santa is feared--though his smile "soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread." And his dress doesn't help, "his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot." The gifts he distributes all fit in a stocking-- he "filled all the stockings...."As the avatar of intrusive magic, Santa is powerful but not entirely welcome, a poorly-dressed, poorly-piped elf. Santa the smoker! Ah, timeshave changed.
