This book is RIDICULOUS! Its a huge, dense story in a small package. I thought I would speed right through it, but it is so dense that it has taken me nearly 3 weeks to get through it.I recommend this book highly. Its smart, thought-provoking, and over-the-top. I have never read anything like it before.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that the incessant absurd metaphors that Robbins uses grow tiresome after the first few chapters. At first they seem clever, but then after the first 20 or so I started rolling my mental eyes each time he used another one.But really, that is the only fault I can find with this novel. It has everything else I could ask for. And as soon as I finished it, I had the urge to turn to the first page and start over again (which is always a sign of a good book)."Teachers who offer you the ultimate answers do not possess the ultimate answers, for if they did, they would know that the ultimate answers cannot be given, they can only be received."
