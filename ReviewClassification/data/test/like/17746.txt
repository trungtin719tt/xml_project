This is my all time favorite book to read to my kids, even down to the size of the book. It uses some tricky moves to get children to learn, and its an incredible story without being a story.Why is one dog still wide awake with his big, white eyes when the rest are asleep? What is he thinking about? And is this the same dog who is asleep when it is time for the dogs to get up? And how about playing checkers on the boat while your buddy plays guitar? Dreamy. And the poor bird crossing the street that makes all the dogs Screech on their brakes. What was he thinking and where was he going? And finally, "Do you like my hat?" I randomly ask my kids that question intermittently and they always know exactly how to answer.By the way, anybody notice that the dog steals the feather out of the female dogs hat at one point? yes, its true. First she has the feather in her hat, then he seems to have snatched it.The Dog party at the end is like an opium dream. This must be the true dog heaven. I want to be reincarnated as a dog and star in Go Dog Go.
