Requiem for a Dreamwas an addiction for me.The pun intended.I couldn't read this fast enough. I wish I hadn't been so busy, and could have devoured this in one day. This is an easy, five star favorite for me.Requiemwas my first Selby, Jr. read, and it definitely impressed me. The writing style is his own, and every character's personality was so visual and real. The story of these four people is heartbreaking in their own ways, but, compulsively readable in their own right.Is it weird to sympathize and feel bad for a drug addict? Is it weird I cared about them? Probably....but I couldn't help it. Harry, Sara, Tyrone, and Marion, the four main characters, were all my favorite. They were each their own character, and they all worked so well together. They felt real, and not just some carbon copy of your typical idea of a junkie. I could hear their voices in my head because of the way each is written.I wish I could say more about how much I love this book. But for some reason, I'm finding it hard to pen exactly what my feelings are about it.I want say this for anyone interested in this book....This book is not for everyone.Requiem for a Dream was my first Hubert Selby, Jr. read. And it definitely won't be the last.
