I know this is a classic and all, but I had a hard time making it through this book. It's full of needless repetition, which makes it longer than it needs to be. What's more, the plot is a mess, leaping from event to event almost randomly at times.I respect what the author is attempting to do here, thematically. Eastman is asking bold questions about how things are related to one another. Are we a green dog or a yellow one? Is it day or night? These are big questions, and they need to be asked.That said, you can have a book that contains big ideas AND an interesting story too. And, unfortunately, the story is severely lacking here.The one saving grace of the book was the "Do you like my hat?" subplot, which was very tight in its execution and satisfying in its resolution.Ultimately, when reading a book like this, the question you have to ask yourself is "Would I buy the sequel?" And I have to say, with some regret, that I wouldn't. There were just too many structural problems with the story for that.* * *Seriously though, I had a great time reading this book with my little boy. Lots of basic words used in different situations make it a great tool. If I was still teaching ESL students, I would use this to clue in struggling students about prepositions. (If you think prepositions are easy, it's only because you're a native speaker. Try explaining to someone from Japan why you get *in* a car but *on* a train.)As a bonus, this book is long. Most kids books seem to be about 20 pages these days, but this is pretty easily triple that. It makes it less of a mind-numbing experience when you end up reading it a couple times.P.S. I meant what I said about the hat subplot. Genius.
