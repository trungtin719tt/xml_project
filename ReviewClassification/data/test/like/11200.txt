This book is very simply written, but powerful. This is exactly the kind of book I want to have around for my daughters when they hit the pre-teen years. There is a wonderful progression of Alanna as slightly scared (but brave) and unsure of her abilities, to an Alanna that's self assured and assertive that I found really inspiring. She deals with a bully, a magical plague, sinister adults, and her grueling classes all while masquerading as a boy so that she can realize her dream of becoming a knight. As I said, this is a simple story. There's not too many plot twists or turns and it's clear that this is an introduction more than anything but it doesn't feel incomplete. I definitely look forward to reading the rest of the series.
