This book attacked my brain like a virus. The character of Kevin, the teenage murderer whose mom narrates the epistolary novel, was so disturbing and harrowingly well-drawn, that I think it caused some sort of chemical reaction in my brain. He gave me nightmares. I swear whenever I picked up the book gray clouds covered the sun.In a series of letters to her estranged husband, narrator Eva dissects her family's life, from the decision to have a child to the day her son locked 9 classmates and a teacher in the gym and used them for target practice. Were Eva's ambivalent feelings about motherhood part of what made Kevin into such a monster, or are some people simply born evil? In the case presented in this book, I'm going to have to lean towards the latter. Even as an infant, Kevin is a solid misanthrope and shows a disarming talent for manipulation.This question, which I think is at the heart of the book, is not as clearly answered as I'm making it out to me. In fact, Lionel Shriver, in writing about readers' responses to this work, says she has seen two camps:"One camp assesses a story about a well-intentioned mother who, whatever her perfectly human deficits in this role, is saddled with a 'bad seed' evil from birth whose ultimate criminality only she seems to perceive but is helpless to prevent..."The second camp of readers appears to have read another novel entirely: about a mother whose coldness is itself criminal and who bears full responsibility for her son's rampage as a teenager."Shriver concludes: "I have found this division gratifying."I definitely recommend this visceral reading experience. One of the quotes on the back calls it "A slow magnetic descent into hell that is as fascinating as it is disturbing," and I think that's pretty accurate. I'm interested to hear what people with children think of it from a parents' perspective. Because I tell ya, it sure makes motherhood seem terrifying.
