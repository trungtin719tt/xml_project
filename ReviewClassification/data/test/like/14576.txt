You can find more reviews@BloodyBookaholicYou know how sometimes authors get a little, am, lazy on the second book of the series? It never seems to live up to the hype? Ends up kind of sucking? Yeah... (*cough*Crossed*cough*)... I know all about it and somewhere along the way you have learned this too.I am proud to announce that Pandemonium was AMAZING, it LIVES UP TO THE HYPE, and it won't let you down at all. Such a freaking revelation. Why aren't books more like this?!The thing that saved this book from being a downer was this: the author didn't just write a straight tale where Lena gets to the wild and then keeps growing, keeps getting strong, blah blah same thing we have read about a hundred times. There is some of this in there for sure, but it's given to us in small doses, in between larger sections that are pack full of adventure and "edge of your seat" kind of moments.Thisis what made the book shine. Going between the past and the present is what saved the book from being pretty slow, and instead it makes it a book worthy of being Delirium's second book.Something I can add to this is that Delirium while it focuses on love, your first love to be specific, I thought Pandemonium focused a little bit more on hate, anger and healing. It certainly showed us a new side to Lena that we never saw before. The combination of her new life and losing Alex has made her get in touch with emotions that would have been closed up to her before, and it is very interesting to see how she manages navigates through her new life.I couldn't leave without a note on the new male interest. He is, something else. He is not going away any time soon, and sure you might hate him at first, but believe he is going to grow on you so much. Plus those sexy scenes between him and Lena certainly helped. I swear my breath literally caught on some passages. I felt like I was there, and it was happening to me.I think that anything more that I say will be too much, a revelation. I don't wanna spoil this story for you because it's afantasticstory. So just know this. If the book sucked, I would tell you flat out why, but it doesn't. It's pretty freaking amazing, and I can't believe I have to wait till 2013 to read the sequel. This is heart breaking, because the book is left on a HUGE cliff hanger that made you want to pull out your hair. I squealed. I really did, people looked at me weird, I kept doing this sort of crazy giggle. You had to be there.Old Update:The cover is here!Cover Revealed: Pandemonium, a Delirium novel (#2) by Lauren OliverIsn't she lovely? Isn't it beautiful? I have to read Delirium...
