I received an ARC via Netgalley in exchange for an honest review!First of all, as you can see from my rating, I quite enjoyed reading about the adventures of Bernard, who travels through a wormhole inside his emotionally distant dad's brain and finds out that there's a whole universe, a Brainiverse, living inside of it! So, he makes it his quest to save his dad, who is in grave danger because the whole right hemisphere of his brain, the one from where intuition, creativity and impulse stems from, is dried up from Energeia, the powerful source that gives live to his brain.This book had everything a great adventure has to offer. It was funny, witty and full of suspense. Nail-biting moments had you glued to the screen and you were really feeling for this boy, who lost his mother and had made it his mission not to lose his dad either! There were hand-less pirates, freakish spaceships/vessels, allies and enemies every kid will be thrilled to read about.It was perfect as a middle-grade read but readers from all age-groups will be able to enjoy this fast-paced adventure since you will be able to laugh, adventure and sympathize with this boy who loved science and before the end had to find the much needed balance in order to save a whole world as well as his dad.
