This short novel, ostensibly about an affair between Robert and a married Francesca, has its share of critics. I think there is a stark reality to this book that can be missed. First, this book is completely plausible. A fleeting affair with a great deal of mutual nostalgia later. Yes the drama is muted and there are quite literally 1,000 ways the author could have made the story more dramatic. Secondly, while the writing about their relationship is limited, the writing about the landscape is descriptive. Thirdly it does not seem that there is a moral takeaway to the story, or at least little in the way of consequences. I think this may seem banal but probably true to life in many cases.I understand that the characters were incomplete and the writing a little clumsy but I would also say that the book is unique, vivid in its way and worth reading. Bridges certainly does not rise to the literary level of say A River Runs Through It, but some of the imagery was similar.I would rate The Bridges of Madison County at 3 1/2 stars.
