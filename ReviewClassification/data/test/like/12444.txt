DRUMROLL PLEASE........its time for some RehvengeEPIC EPIC EPIC SWOON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mohawk madness......need.want.gotta.have.more....Rehv- or the Reverend, as the human clientele called him- was a drug lord and pimp who didn't give a shit about the vast majority of people. Which meant he was capable of, and frequently did, anything the fuck he wanted to. So the guy who cared about very little was in charge of a hell of a lot.[image error]Rehvenge is a ......holy swoony sex on a stick......It's so hard to review a book like this...there's so many side stories and so much information....my mind is blown every time I finish a book in the series. This book broke my heart because Rehv was so damn yummy alpha and fiercely loving and protective of his family and friends. He had to make a lot of sacrifices to protect those he loved. So although he was a pimp, and a drug lord, and a murderer and a lot of other less than noble things....I could overlook it all because he had a heart of pure damn gold!! He is onebadass loyal hunk of pure maleI was worried for a hot minute that he would become my favorite brother and displace my currentRHAGE.....it was a tough call....This series keeps getting better and better....I can't wrap my head around how genius it is.[image error]Ladies, Rehvenge....."the street pharmacist"is MINE !!Lisa Jayne......I love ya!!
