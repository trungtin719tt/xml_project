I know I just now finished the second book of this series, but it feels like such an accomplishment every time I finish a book. I've seriously fell in love with this series so much. More than I ever expected to and I'm hoping I can stay with this series until the end since most people have said they stopped more or less halfway through. But so far, I've been so wrapped up in the Shadowhunter world that I don't see myself stopping any time soon! I'm so excited to see what else The Mortal Instruments has to offer.That being said, I do have a question about the order in which I'm supposed to read both The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices. Some people say to read both TMI and TID at the same time based on publication dates because TMI spoils a few details from TID. But others say that it's fine to finish TMI and then start TID afterwards.Can anyone tell me which order would be best to read The Mortal Instruments and The Infernal Devices?
