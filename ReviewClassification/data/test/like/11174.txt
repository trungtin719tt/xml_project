Book #4 in The Chronicles of Narnia, Prince Caspian reunites readers with Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy who find themselves traveling back to Narnia. But this Narnia is different from the one which they left. In fact, many years have passed and their time in Narnia has become something of a legend that no one quite believes to be true. That also includes the great lion known as Aslan. The quartet soon become entwined with the fate of a young man known as Prince Caspian. Caspian is fleeing from his uncle, the king, who wants to kill him. Adventure and magic follow and a lot of new characters snuggle their way into reader's hearts.I must confess that when reading The Lion, The Witch, and the Wardrobe as a child, Lucy was always my favorite. With Prince Caspian, I am adding dear Edmund to the list. But goodness Peter and Susan were so condescending to their sister. I took this as a hint from C.S. Lewis that this will be their last Narnian adventure. This book more than makes up for book 3 (The Horse and his boy)which failed to impress me.
