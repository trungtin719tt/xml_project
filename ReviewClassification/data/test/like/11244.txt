I saw the first movie and didn't understand nothing. Too much action! But this retold version is quite different from the movies, because the story takes place after the Vietnam War. But now I completely understand this abridged version from the original book (with MP3). I studied German at the university 30 years ago and thought this language was very difficult, but learning English is also very difficult, but I'll succeed.
