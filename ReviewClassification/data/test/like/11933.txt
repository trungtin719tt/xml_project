Well, I finally finished The Fiery Cross.*sigh*I absolutely LOVE these books. This installment was no exception.....I found that this installment had so many deep emotional scenes, that when i finished, I felt that i had connected to the characters, emotionally, more then ever before.Starting with The Gathering, when Jamie calls his people out, and they all hold hands. The wedding scene between Roger and Brianna was both hilarious and touching. The various incidents at the Gathering really set up so much for the story. I love how Diana Gabaldon weaves the tale with details so deep, and how it all comes together in the end.My complaint after "Drums of Autumn" was that, while i cared about Roger and Brianna, i didnt feel as emotionally connected to them, as i did with Jamie and Claire. In fact, i didnt really like Brianna very much. In Fiery Cross, i found that the deeper exploration of the relationship between Roger and Brianna was very satisfying. Roger especially, gave a whole new facet to the face of the family living at Fraser's Ridge. His brush with death, when he was hanged, was especially heart wrenching. The loss of his voice, and his constant doubts as to the paternity of Jemmy, and his own marriage really made me sympathize with him.The atomosphere of Frasers Ridge is intoxicating. The natural beauty she describes. The danger. Fraser's Ridge is a character in itself.I love these characters. When Roger almost died, before i realized that he was alive, i put my head down and cried. it was horrible!! but so well written, and thats the beauty of this author. His reaction to his "almost death" was heartbreaking for the entire family and as a reader, you felt it yourself.Wee Ian!!! I honestly didnt think we would ever see him again. I thought for sure he would turn up dead, or only mentioned in memory. I was thrilled when he came back. Because i enjoyed this character so much, i was thrilled that he now knows the family secret of the stones."I knew you weren't a wee fairie Auntie Claire!"my favorite quote.
