The Shopaholic series always puts me in a good mood. Really all of Sophie Kinsella's books put me in a good mood. They are just so light, fluffy and fun. Sophie Kinsella's writing is like ice cream on hot July day.In Confessions of a Shopaholic we meet Rebecca Bloomwood(Becky to her friends) a young financial writer who longs to write for a fashion magazine. She lives in a trendy "flat" with her bestie and loves to shop. I mean really really loves to shop. So much so that she finds herself deeply in debt. To cope with her financial problems she does what any shopping addict would do.. She shops even more. Running up more and more debt.Now since this is a light comedic book all of this is handled in the most hilarious of ways. I never for one second dislike Becky or look down on her for her terrible financial problems. As a person who loves to shop and never looks at prices I can see how easy it would be to fall into a financial hole. Thankfully I don't have money issues ( knock on wood) but I feel Becky's pain in wanting to buy everything you see.The Shopaholic series is one of my go to books that always instantly improve my mood. Also these books are such quick reads that I can easily read a whole book in a day or two.Recommended to readers who like light fun books with irrepressible hilarious heroines.
