This book changed how I worked and how I set goals. It isn't the feel-good self-help book it appears.Read again before going back to work in January 2014. I think it's fitting that the first time I read this, I was in grad school and planning for the future, and that I would read it again as I leave behind the career I was planning for back then. Well, somewhat. I'm letting music librarianship go and focusing on being an assistant director in the library, and also to figuring out what the next move will be in a few years.A couple of things I'm mulling over after the second read:-Moving beyond to-do lists, which can be a false sense of achievement-Not letting work be the only place where goals are set-Valuing difference-Becoming a person who helps others achieve their goals-Quadrant II (again)
