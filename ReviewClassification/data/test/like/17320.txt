I have read both The Winds of War and its sequel, War and Remembrance numerous times, though this is the first time I have listened to either. I keep re-reading these books because they are extraordinarily good. This book ends shortly after Pearl Harbor and War and Remembrance takes up the story from there.Mr Wouk masterfully interweaves the fictional Henry family into the events of WWII. Through their adventures and struggles we see events in Berlin during the late 1930s, we experience the shock of the attack on Pearl Harbor, we live the fear of being (or loving one who is) Jewish. We explore Poland during the initial attacks, and Italy when Mussolini declares war. We travel to Russia during the Germans insurgence into that country. The Henry family are a United States Navy family -- important and highly ranked, brand new and brash lieutenants, wives and daughters. They interact with the real characters of the War including FDR, Hitler and Churchill. We meet many admirable and not so admirable fictional people, and many admirable and not so admirable real people. Mr Wouk allows the fictional and real characters to interact in so many small ways that it is easy to forget which characters are real. Before I read this book the first time I knew very little about WWII. I was young and ignorant of the time and place and had little interest in changing that fact. This book sent me running to find more information and I have been a big fan of this period of history ever since. I have read many, many books about the war since. But none -- fiction or nonfiction -- have ever challenged me and entertained me as much as these books.I like books which entertain and educate, but I detest books that are dry or difficult to read. In my opinion, the only way a book can meet all of these requirements is for the author to portray intriguing, complicated and flawed characters. Mr Wouk does this. Pug is stubborn, obstinate and egotistical, as well as being brilliant and honorable. Rhoda is selfish and flighty, as well as being loyal. Byron is impetuous, but is also brave, ardent and eager. Natalie is judgmental, but is also devoted and dutiful. They are unique, interesting and very real. They are not cartoonish in any way.Mr Pariseau is an excellent reader. I had so many preconceived ideas about how this book should sound. I had their voices in my head already. I had the temperature of the book already decided, and knew exactly how I would read this book because I have read it so many times. Mr Pariseau read with subtlety, and exquisite humility. He doesn't overreach which could be easy to do given the huge number of characters. I found that I could listen with ease, almost forgetting that someone was reading to me. This is the best thing I could say, and so he deserves all of those 5 stars, and more.
