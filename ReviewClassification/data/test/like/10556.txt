This series was my ENTIRE LIFE when I was a small human child.I saved any and all money I received to buy the books (my first collection of matching hardcovers) and listened to them on cassette tape (OKAY GUESS WHO JUST SOUNDS OLD RIGHT NOW) when I wasn't re-reading the physical copies. Hello I even intended to become a famous author myself and write under the pseudonym "Orange Peel" because obviously.So yes. I am a mild fan right here.And I decided Ihadto reread before the Netflix series comes out! Of which I will be watching. And hopefully flailing ecstatically -- which is a big big word here which means "FREAKING OUT BECAUSE LEMONY SNICKET IS THE BEST THING OF LIFE".Ahem.(I also loved the movie, just so you know. SODA. SODA. BANANA. #IUnderstoodThatReference)Obviously the series is timeless.I completely adored it even though I'm 23 and not, erm, 10. But whatever. The true sign of a good book is that any age can adore it.Although I found the story 1000% more creepy than I did as a kid....because Olaf's ploy to marry Violet because just that bitmorecreepy when you think about it.And of courseit made my little soul totally muchly painedto see the torment the Baudelaire's go through. But I love the clever quips and the witty jokes and Iadorehow it doesn't dumb down the children. Any time a character tries to dumb down a character, the Baudelaire's glare and fight back. GO SMART CHILDREN WHO DESERVE TO BE TREATED AS HUMANS AND NOT OBJECTS. I love this series omg. Wait while I frolic down memory lane.THIS IS AN UNFORTUNATE SERIES AND I LOVE IT.
