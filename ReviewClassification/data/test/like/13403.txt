Sometimes people are beautiful.Not in looks.Not in what they say.Just in what they are.The Book Thiefis one of my favorite books ever (if not my favorite book ever), then how is it possible that I lovedI Am the Messengereven more?This book is just... beautiful, from start to finish. I'm not really good at putting my thoughts into words so I know that nothing I could ever say will bring this book justice (but that still won't stop me from trying).First of all, it took me a long time to read this book, but it wasn't the books fault. I had to study for a test to get into college (I got accepted, YAY!), so my reading had to suffer from it. But even that didn't stop me from enjoying this book completely. I think if I had the time I would finish it in one sitting.At the beginning, I thought that I was reading just an ordinary book, with ordinary characters and their ordinary lives. But now, that I've finished it, I can say that this book is anythingbutordinary. It made me laugh, it made me tear up, it made me angry, and at the ending it left me feeling emotionally drained, but also really happy (if that makes any sense). It really touched me, and made me think about things that I (and a lot of us) just take for granted. I can't count the times when I've read a quote from this book that made me stop reading and just think about it for a few seconds.And the ending is the reason that I ended up liking this book even more than theThe Book Thief. I'm not gonna say anything about the ending, except that it blew my mind and that I still get goosebumps thinking about it.So I think that's enough from me, cause I feel like if I continue I'll start getting emotional, and I wouldn't want that. So in conclusion, amazing book that will stick with me for the rest of my life, and that I will definitely come back to more than once.
