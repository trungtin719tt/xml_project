Absolutely 5 stars!Oh My God! I really loved this book even though it was frustrating when Elizabeth and Logan knows that they like each other and it takes forever for them tell each other I love you. and when Keith, Elizabeth's ex came into the picture. I did cry towards the end, but I feel when ever I read a Nickolas Sparks books I feel like I always cry towards the end because it is always has a sad ending but it always has a good ending.
