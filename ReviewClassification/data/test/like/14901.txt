I loved this book!!! I can't believe I forgot to update and review it here. Sometimes I know I've read a book years ago but can't remember a lot about it. However, that is not the case with this book. I read it in 1999 when I was pregnant with my daughter. It seems like yesterday. It is so well written and such a wonderful book that remains with me all these years later.The main character Novalee Nation a 17 year old who is abandoned by her boyfriend and who gives birth to a baby girl in a Wal-Mart store. Novalee was such a great character and easy to love and root for. There is also such a great cast of supporting characters in this book that are treasures with a couple that you will love to hate! Characters who open their hearts and home to Novalee and teach her many lessons while helping her raise her daughter Americus.This was such a unique story that was so hard to put down. Heartwarming, funny and quite intense at times. A page turner with so much heart that I will always recommend it highly.
