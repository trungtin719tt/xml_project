In the 9th Sookie book we are basically facing the fall-out from 2 revelations: That Sookie's Great-Grandfather is Fairy Royalty, and that the Were's have finally revealed themselves. Each has results ending in not very good things for Sookie, mainly kidnapping from psycho fairies who are responsible for her parents deaths (I always knew there had to be more to the flash flood) and Arlene plotting with the Fellowship to kill Sookie and string her up on a cross. There is also requisite murder that shines a light on Jason (this time it's his pregnant ex), and of course really has nothing to do with him other than his lineage and a gay were-panther falling in love with him. Very enjoyable, though I felt the ending needed a little more explanation...how will Amelia handle Tray's death? Why does Sookie think that Bill was more willing to risk his life for her than Eric? Why was Eric detained? I don't like that these will hold over and therefore not be answered for at least a year.Also 2 things I found odd: Being a pregnant woman in this book was not a good thing to be, both Crystal and Claudine died (Tara should watch out!) Also to indicate that Sookie was always on edge she was always "jumping an inch" or 2 or 6 to indicate how freaked she was and this was very repetitive, there are other ways to indicate the wariness and paranoia of people other than this hackneyed phrase.Plus I loved the Vampire reality show (which you can read on her website already if you can't wait).
