I agree with many of the reviewers who praise this fun and inventive novel, but I am especially fascinated by how Gaiman represents race inAnansi Boys. He chooses not to explicitly identify that his globe-trotting main characters are black until at least p. 32 (if I'm mistaken, somebody please let me know) and only then as a point-of-fact that is secondary to their status as gods. It is true that anyone who has readAmerican Godsor heard traditional African folktales will have met Anansi before, but even here the story emphasizes the cultural distinctiveness of the Caribbean island where this Anansi lives without employing heavy racial signifiers. (This isn't the same as being "race-neutral" - whatever that means! - and the white characters are identified as such.) At first I thought it was odd, then really interesting and a thoughtful way to put Anansi and his fellow gods on equal footing with other cultural myths and legends.Toni Morrisonexperiments with this in "Recitatif" andParadise, but it is nice to see the technique employed in unexpected places. The story is also influenced by Zora Neale Hurston's work, which is cool. While I still likeAmerican Godsbetter, this is a great read. It's also hilarious - see one of the quotes I saved below.
