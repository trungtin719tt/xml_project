Read this book while vacationing in Cancun in 1998. Read the final page watching the dawn on the beach. Perfect experience!If I remember correctly, it was one of my favorite books during that time. The book made me compelled to write a letter and throw it out to sea, which I never did.It's a heartfelt story that should be read. However, it's not memorable because after all of these years, I am not interested in reading it again. It's a one-time-good-book read. If you like Sparks's writing, then I highly recommend this book. If you enjoy stories about how two people don't know about each other, but it's fate that they should be together, get this book. If you're into sappy love stories, get this book. Otherwise, don't. :-)
