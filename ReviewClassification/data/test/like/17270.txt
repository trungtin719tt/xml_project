These are the first three books of the series 'Percy Jackson and the Olympians'. All the books of this series were very good. Although I did enjoy all of them, the one that was more interesting was the third book. The third book was 'Percy Jackson and the Titan's Curse'. This book, in my opinion, had the most adventure. They lost and gain new people throughout their 'Prophecy'. None of the other books really had that in them. You may disagree and like other books, but the third book remains the best to me.
