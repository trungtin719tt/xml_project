I can't even begin to think how to start this review. I just now finished the book so I'm trying my hardest to process everything. The reason I give this book 5 stars is because for one, I loved the overall story. Not once did I get bored reading it, or have to set it down because things weren't going smoothly. I truly adored it........until of course the ending. I'm glad I read some of the review with nonspoilers so I was expecting something dramatic to happen. I read people throwing the book, screaming, all sorts of things, so at least I was prepared.But I have to tell you, I, myself was in tears and close to nausea (yes I REALLY get into the books I read). It took everything I had to hold in the tears. Even now, I'm having to fight against them and the anger I feel for the events that took place. I'm even angrier that I didn't wait longer to read this book because now, I'm going to have to wait until April to figure out what happens. I love this series and pray things turn out better in the next one. I don't want to put any spoilers in here for fear of ruining the book for someone else, but if you've read it then you know what I'm talking about when I say this....I pray he comes back, it doesn't feel right without him there. Damn, hope even that isn't too much. But now my heart feels empty.Cast authors, I really hope you do the right thing for the next book. I think if you don't, I truly might throw this next one and refuse to ever read another again.
