I read mysteries in between denser reads and Dame Christie never disappoints me. As in all of her cases involving Inspector Hercule Poirot, Christie unearths layer upon layer of the case, leaving her readers guessing until the very end. Just when you think whodunit, she throws in a twist by revealing a key clue that only Poirot could have thought of. Occasionally, I guess the criminal, but other times I am left stumped. This time, in The Murder of Roger Ackroyd, Christie leaves me hanging until her final paragraphs, creating a thrilling case.In this particular case Dr James Sheppard meets his old friend Roger Ackroyd for supper and minutes later Ackroyd is found murdered. To solve this particular crime involving blackmail, drugs, and forced marriages, Ackroyd's niece Flora turns to Hercule Poirot to get to the bottom of the murder. As in the other of his cases that I have read, Poirot just happens to be in the area because he is either retired or on a holiday. Here, he claims to be doing Miss Ackroyd a favor and states that this is his last case, which, of course, it is not. Just as in the other Poirot tales I have read, he uses his little gray cells, stumps the local police, irks the local populace who are happy to be rid of the little Belgian man, yet solves each case in ways that most detectives are not capable of achieving.I am attempting to read primarily women authors during March, Women's History Month. This month would not be complete without an Agatha Christie mystery because she remains the standard that many modern mystery writers strive to attain. Roger Ackroyd was definitely a captivating Christie case but not quite at the level for me as Orient Express was. I am enthralled by Poirot's manner of solving cases, but I must space them out so that his mannerisms and humor do not stale for me. Yet, Christie is still Christie, and this case rates a sparkling 4 stars.
