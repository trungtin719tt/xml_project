If i pray every night, and hang around with humans, and leave the Weres alone, i'll be okay.Murder,court,law,lies,bombs,bloood...It would have been more help to me if he'd come ten minutes earlier... or not at all.Useless as always. Is Quinn supposed to be interesting and are we supposed to care about his relationship with Sookie? And i thought that her relationship with Bill was boring.I feel like the start wasn't THAT strong but i was really invested after like 100-150pages. It was a fun read. Honestly if you enjoyed the other 6 books, you will also enjoy this one.
