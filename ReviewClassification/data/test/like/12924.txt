Anne Morrow Lindbergh wrote these musings in 1955, and it is definitely a capture in a moment of time, when roles for women were still assumed to be #1- marriage, #2 - having children, and #3 - taking care of the household. Lindbergh herself in the 20 year anniversary afterword in the version I have mused on how quickly roles and rights changed in her own lifetime, and how central women were to not only their own rights but other civil rights movements.Still, even though I am not a mother or a housewife, I still found plenty that resonated with me. The need for silence, for solitude, for reflection. The ways we deplete ourselves without carving out time for breathing and thinking. And the gift of being on an island. In my imaginary life, on an imaginary island, I would keep this on my bookshelf to pull out in quiet moments, and maybe use her words to inspire me to be better at journaling and pulling back. Some of it fits right in with my desire to be more mindful, more reflective, and maybe there are some shells with something to teach me too.This book was discussed onEpisode 062of the Reading Envy Podcast.
