When a very close friend lists a book as an ALL-TIME FAVORITE!!...the pressure to love it, and give it a review deserving of its fabulous-ness, is immense...when that very close friend is the gloooooorious Stepheny- the pressure is OFF THE CHARTS!!!! Anyone familiar with her- will know EXACTLY what I mean. ;)...So here goes nothing *deep breath*...THE DRAWING OF THE THREE- the second book in The Dark Tower series- takes place seven hours after we last left Roland Deschain inThe Gunslinger. The Man in Black had laid his cards on the table (so to speak)...and trust him or not, Roland is going to follow his lead...Roland wakes up on the beach, and immediately knows he has a BIG problem! Lobster-like creatures are attacking him...and before he can react to the strangeness of the situation- he has lost two of his fingers and a big toe. Now he has to worry about tending to his wounds before infection sets in. And now he has to worry about dying- before he can follow through with THE DRAWING OF THE THREE...First Door(1987)- The Prisoner: Eddie Dean- Eddie is a young heroin addict who is traveling by air, attempting to smuggle cocaine into New York for the drug lord Enrico Balazar...but the flight attendants are becoming a little bit suspicious of him, and Roland is going to have to step in to get Eddie out of some veeeeeeery hot water.Second Door(1964)- The Lady of Shadows: Odetta Holmes- Odetta is a wealthy, wheelchair-bound black woman, missing her legs below the knees- after being pushed in front of a subway train. Odetta is completely unaware that she has an alternate personality "Detta Walker" who is veeeeeeeeeeeery different from the normal, kind, sweet, Odetta- in fact Detta is downright dangerous.Third Door(1977)- The Pusher: Jack Mort (Mort meaning "death" in French)- Jack is a sociopath...who's relevance becomes clear- as soon as Roland sees what Jack has been up to in his evil little demented life.Each door- brings a new person into Roland's world..and each person brings a new set of problems Roland must overcome. Let the good times begin!!For all you GOOD-Readers that were less than over-joyed with The Gunslinger...please please please- just try to get past that hurdle, because what is in store for you in- THE DRAWING OF THE THREE, is sooooooo worth the ride!!!...And...Thank you! Thank you! Thank you...toQuick Draw Stepheny- and my other fellow buddy-reading pals-Calamity Bev,Jumpin' Jeff, andStraight Shootin' Susan-for making this journey soooooooo much more fun than it would have ever been alone.
