Love this book, own it.Story of a group of people waiting to die (really, they are) in Australia as a cloud of radioactive fallout moves closer and closer to them. (Most of the human population on Earth are already dead; the world has gone silent except for Australia.) The main characters go about their lives as much as possible and include the crew of the last nuclear sub (under Royal Australian command), a young married couple and their baby, a scientist who loves to drive race cars, and a young woman who falls in love with the commander of the sub.The atmosphere is both tense - and normal. There is no panic or fear until the very end, and to add a bit of mystery, the sub keeps receiving a mysterious message, or signal, from somewhere on the west coast of the US.The 1959 movie is also very good, starring Fred Astaire, Gregory Peck, Ava Gardner and Anthony Perkins and I have never endorsed a movie based on a book before. But they are both THAT good.
