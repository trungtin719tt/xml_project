4.5 stars!Another fantastic reread! While I don't love it as much as the first, it's a solid follow up to an amazing book. I love Cat and Bones, and that one scene. YOU KNOW WHAT SCENE! Omg, if I had virgin eyes they'd be flaming in my skull right now because of THAT scene. Anyways, ignore the horrible covers, this is one of the best PNR series out there.
