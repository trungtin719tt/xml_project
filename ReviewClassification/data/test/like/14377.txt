For anyone who says that reading fiction is not as edifying and worthwhile as reading a non-fiction book, I say, "Have you readChristy?"I mourn that Catherine Marshall wasn't around in my lifetime, but I feel so utterly blessed that she poured her heart and soul and love into this eternal story! There are more moments of true wisdom tucked away in this biographical novel than in any other book I've read outside of The Book... and it's all nestled effortlessly in a touching, gripping, fascinating, and beautiful story!Each time I read it I'm reminded of the beauty and awesome power of God's love. I remember and drink in the eternal wisdom in all Miss Alice says and does. I am fascinated by the impetuous, passionate and immature character of Christy that every woman with a kindred spirit can identify with. I am given hope for a world in which God's love can be allowed to work.What. A. Classic.
