No point reviewing something I read 40 years ago unless I decide to re-read it one day. And at $1.99 on Kindle today, 15 July 2018, that sounds like a tempting idea.For anyone innocent of Stegner's gorgeous word-edifices, this is an excellent place to become acquainted with him. There is a piffling controversy surrounding this book's use of a Victorian historian's actual letters in a fictional context, but seriously people! Is there some copyright violation implied in this absurd kerfuffle? NO! The lady died many years before Stegner was born, and he doesn't ever even imply that the words are his own.Sheesh.So anyway, back to why you should read this book: Right there in the title is the key to understanding and appreciating Stegner as a writer. The poetic-sounding title refers to an engineering concept. Theangle of reposerefers to the last stable point a granular substance achieves before a cascading failure occurs. That's the most perfect title for this book I can imagine.(And if you're an engineer, please feel free to correct my misunderstanding of the term. Otherwise belt up.)
