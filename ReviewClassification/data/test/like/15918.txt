I read this book as a small child and it fast became one of my favorites. So when I saw this in the bookstore the other day, I had to get it and share it with my son.I loved the simplicity of it. Ferdinand is a bull, but he isn't a very fierce one. He's more of a nature lover than a fighter. I love that Ferdinand just wanted to be left alone to sit quietly under his favorite tree and smell the flowers. I think that's probably what I related to most as a child - just wanting to be left alone to do what you enjoy doing. And you know what? I still relate to that sentiment today! My son loved the fact that Ferdinand "didn't want to hurt his friends". I like that about him, too. It's a rare trait where Ferdinand is from. He isn't like the other bulls and that's okay because he's happy; and that's the most important thing of all!
