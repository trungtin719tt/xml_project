This series is fantastic! I'm hurdling towards the end, gaining on the seventh book that ends this series and ends my voyeuristic adventures with Bones and Cat. Those two sure got a beating this time around! This book was definitely more angsty than the previous ones. Bones and Cat suffered through some seriously turbulent times, even separating for a while that left me bereft and empty. I had to sneak a peak farther into the book to appease my heartbreak--I don't like to cheat, but I honestly needed to know when to expect some making up!From the beginning our fearless couple dealt with some gut-wrenching revelations, the biggest being Cat previously making a blood bond(vampire marriage) with someone else. The problem is she doesn't have any recollection of this. So begins the action packed and stress inducing adventure in finding out what really happened. This situation causes a huge rift between Bones and Cat.She's always been jealous of Bones' past and his many conquests. Her insecurity becomes a roaring fire and they both say hurtful and vicious things to each other. Bones has always suspected Cat of having one foot out the door, so to speak. He knows she loves him more than anything but the revelations that she may have been given to another tears him apart and brings his own insecurities to the forefront.Many readers had a problem with this book specifically because of the rift between our beloved couple. I can see that but more importantly I see it a different way. All couples fight, viciously even at times, but it's how we emerge from these differences that determines the strength of our relationships. The same for Bones and Cat. They have always faced hurdles to their relationship but nothing that acutely threatens it, till now. I think they had to go through this in order to push the boundaries of being together, to see that their love is truly iron-clad.I'm not trying to pick sides, but Cat seemed to annoy me with her actions rather than Bones. She's often impulsive for her own good and used her insecurities as a crutch with him. She acts without knowing all the angles and doubts Bones's abilities more than he doubts hers. There were many situations that required the simple task of ASKING A QUESTION. she succumbed to her own fears and denied her instincts. There's a scene when Bones confronts Cat about their troubled relationship that killed me. It was excruciating to read and imagine how he felt saying the things he did. My heart broke for both of them but I have never seen Bones so raw and hurting, it almost did me in.Not to say that Bones was innocent. He was responsible for holding back information and acting before ASKING A QUESTION. It got to the point that the stubbornness these two shared was keeping them apart. But like I said, their strength and love for one another is unbreakable. Many things happen here, including a new development that completely surprised everyone and although things ended beautifully between Cat and Bones, there are many unresolved issues looming on the horizon and enemies waiting in the midst.Looking forward to continuing this series, it's an excellent one giving us everything from action to hot romance!
