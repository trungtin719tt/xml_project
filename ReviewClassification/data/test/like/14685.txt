Even though the thriller is not my favorite genre I liked all the books of the trilogy. The author created a quite different kind of heroine.She is somebody who is supposed mentally incompetent by law, and in spite of disgraceful family background, she is able to use her intelligence to carry on every part in the puzzles to solve.There are more interesting characters, some of them really evil and some full of courage but she is the center of attention as well as the plot.Recommended for those who love this genre.
