In this book you go on an adventure with the vampire Lestat, while he is lost in finding the meaning of immortality. He wakes from a 200 year sleep to find the world he knew so much more develop from what it was. He finds a liking to rock music and from it creates the biggest rock band in history. in the music he is open about being a vampire, this goes against all codes from being a vampire and angers all others. This created a whole new meaning of Lestats life, and opens doors for the amazing history of it.The Author used such great detail in this book. The pages are still vivid in my mind. Every thing that you ever wanted to know about the orgin of vampires Anne Rice gives it and much more.This books was fantastic but some of the details Dawdled and a few places it seemed as if the book would never end, I felt as if the author was ranting a bit, it was a bit tedious to get through.If you enjoyed this book I highly recommend all the the Vampire Chronicles, the story that go with each are simply amazing. But do not watch the movie Queen of the damned, The movie ruins the book by far and has little connection to anything.
