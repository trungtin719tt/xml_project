SpoilersA fucked up, incestuous, surreal carnival story filled with horrible characters who have little to no redeeming qualities. I spent most of my time cringing and shuddering in revulsion whilst readingGeek Love, but in a can't-look-away-car-crash-what's-going-to-happen-next-these-characters-make-me-sick-but-every-disturbing-thing-they-do-is-oh-so-engrossing kind of way. It was utterly absorbing in its WTFery and uniqueness.Hmm, not really sure where to start with the story so I'll just talk about the characters first:Al and Lil Binewski (the parents):Both of them were absolutely despicable, the pair of them were so obsessed with running a successful carnival that they happily took drugs and all sorts of chemical concoctions whilst pregnant so their children would turn out deformed enough that people would buy tickets to see them. The fact some of their children died didn't stop them from poisoning future babies, it only made them more determined. They had no shame or guilt for what they did, so much so they still put their dead children to good use by displaying them in cases so their customers could gawk at them. It only gets worse, if they thought their child was 'normal' they were so devastated by it that they no longer wanted them and were cool with abandoning them. Not only that, they gave their living children all sorts of issues by favouring and loving best the child who was 'freakiest' and most popular.I hated them at the beginning for what they did to their kids, they grew up having fucked up views and relationships, they didn't have normal childhoods or a proper education, they had to work straight away and happily be gawked at from a very early age. Bizarrely, even though they pissed me off with all their selfishness and craziness by the end I kind of liked them, what they did to their kids was unforgivable but they almost seemed normal, kind, and loving in comparison to other characters.Olympia Binewski (Al/Lil's daughter/albino hunchback dwarf/protagonist):At first I though Olympia wasn't as bad as her family, I was rooting for her to have some happiness and break free from the oppressive life she lived. However, by the end of the book I hated her the most. The only thing I liked about her was her being content with her physical appearance and not wanting to be 'normal'. Other than that she was worse than terrible for so many different reasons.Firstly, she was beyond pathetic, her desperation to fit in and be accepted by Arty (her older brother/star of the carnival) and her family made her utterly unlikeable. She made doormat people everywhere look strong and stubborn. She had less than zero self-respect and dignity when it came to Arty. He walked all over her, treated her like rubbish, messed up her/their family yet she still chased after him, put him above everyone else and only really cared about him. Her pathetic loser personality made me want to punch things.Secondly, the way she conceived her daughter, Miranda, was sickening. She made her eleven year old brother (Chick) telekinetically steal their older brother's sperm and implant it in her. Arty didn't give his consent, he had no idea what was happening but that didn't matter to Oly, she wanted her brother's baby and that was that. She basically raped him of his sperm. I was glad Arty didn't end up wanting baby Miranda and forced Oly to get rid of her, it deserved her right not being able to raise Miranda, the psycho didn't deserve to have a daughter.Thirdly, Oly was a cruel, selfish bitch when it came to Miranda's childhood. Miranda was born with a tail and when she was given to some nuns to raise, they wanted to have her tail removed so she wouldn't feel different and she'd fit in with the rest of the kids and not be teased or bullied. But oh no, Oly refused. She wanted her daughter to grow up with a tail because Miranda being normal was shameful to Oly and her family (even though said family would never see Miranda again). She didn't give a fuck about Miranda and doing what was best for her, everything was about making Arty and her family proud or some bullshit. Ugh, then there was Olympia's reaction to finding out Miranda hated having to grow up with a tail, Oly thought Miranda was a selfish and ungrateful bitch for not being happy to grow up different and deformed. Maybe Miranda would have seen her tail as something good if she grew up in carnival full of 'freaks' but she grew up in the real world and had no idea where she came from, so why would she like having something that made others see her as weird and abnormal?! Oly was deluded to think Miranda would be pleased by it all.The last straw was when Oly blamed Miranda for being targeted by that psycho Miss Lick, it wasn't Miranda's fault that Miss Lick was so jealous and bitter that she paid for beautiful women to be mutilated! Ugh, Miranda was lucky not to have been raised by Oly.As much as I hated Oly for all her faults and WTFery she still managed to be an extremely entertaining character.Arty (Oly's older brother, half shark/half man):Arty was definitely the most immoral and evil character. Even though he was far worse than Oly in everything he did, I didn't detest him nearly as much, probably because he wasn't narrating the story. He did so many fucked up things, the ones that enraged me most was him basically pimping out his sisters, creating his Arturism cult which required people to cut of their limbs, and slowly taking control of the carnival away from his parents. Also, killing off his defenceless siblings out of pettiness and jealousy. He was a prick and a half but an utterly entertaining one. I did like that even though he was pure evil, he wasn't one dimensional, he had all kinds of weird and messed up emotions and layers when it came to his family. I do wish he'd been written as more charismatic and more of an enigma though, I just didn't get why everyone was drawn to him and worshipped him with such intensity.Iphy/Elly (Oly's sisters/Siamese twins):They were relatively normal compared to Oly/Arty. I preferred Elly from the two, unlike Iphy she wasn't enamoured of Arty.It was sad when Elly was basically lobotomised by Arty, I was happy he felt some guilt but it was disappointing that the guilt he felt was more down to him upsetting Iphy than him hurting Elly.Then there was Mumpho (Elly/Iphy's son), I didn't blame Elly for killing him, she was brain damaged and no doubt disgusted by her body being used in such an awful way. It really wasn't her fault.Iphy got on my nerves, she was timid and weak and almost as bad as Oly when it came to loving Arty.Chick (Oly's younger brother/telekinetic but otherwise normal):Loved this guy, he was the most likeable. I was cheering him on when he finally stood up to Arty's manipulations and killed him. Although, I would have preferred if Arty hadn't died instantly and had instead suffered greatly for years before his death, he needed a taste of his own medicine, he got off way too easy.Miranda (Oly/Arty's daughter, has a tail):Other than Miranda being a bit of a user, she was pretty nice. I think her growing up an orphan away from the Binweski's was good for her, she would have ended up fucked up and with lots of issues if she was raised with Oly and co.Miss Lick (mad rich woman/likes to deform beautiful women):What a cow targeting vulnerable girls, and manipulating and emotionally blackmailing them into destroying their bodies/faces. She was a spiteful, jealous, hard woman. She deserved a far more painful death than the one she got - I don't know why Oly felt so guilty about killing her when she was planning on hurting her daughter. Also, it was weird how Oly seemed to care more about Miss Lick's welfare than she did about Elly. She showed no emotion when Elly was more or less destroyed by Arty, it was like she was happy about what happened to Elly. Yet she had lots of compassion and sympathy for the horrible Miss Lick - another reason as to why I hated Oly.Other random thoughts:-Why did Oly love Arty so much? He treated her like crap 99.9% of the time, he bullied her, scared her and was cruel to her growing up. Her adoration of him made no sense, it wasn't like she only had him in her life, she had Chick, the twins and her parents and they didn't constantly treat her like crap. Oly's devotion to him was based on jack all.-Why did Iphy, Chick, Oly and thousands of others worship Arty so blindly? Sure, he was entertaining but that didn't account for the level of love he received. His personality wasn't that endearing and he didn't say anything all that profound, he wasn't inspiring in any way, he was just a hateful bastard.I didn't get it.-Arty managed to get thousands of people to slowly cut of all their limbs, thus making them pure and freeing them from pain and hardship. It was bonkers. I could see vulnerable and hopeless people being manipulated to join a cult and escape reality, but I couldn't buy thousands of them eagerly and permanently destroying their bodies. It was too far fetched for me. Also, why wasn't he stopped by the police/government? Surely, it wasn't legal.-All the incestuous vibes were creepy and nauseating. Iphy and Oly were so hot for Arty they wanted to marry him despite him being their brother, it was like it was normal for them to have sexual feelings for each other. I didn't get it, Arty was more fish/shark than man, he had fins and had to either roll around or be carried everywhere, there was nothing attractive (physical or otherwise) about him.Then there was Oly's obsession with her daughter, the way she described and followed and watched her daughter was messed up. It was like she fancied her or something.-I got sick of Olympia constantly comparing Melinda to some Binewski trait or other, it was extremely repetitive and heavy handed.-The slow falling apart of the Binewski family was done really well. In a weird sort of way they started off strong and loving, then they just crashed and burned, which was mostly down to Arty's ambitions and narcissism.-The writing was a bit hit and miss for me, some of the descriptions were way too vulgar and crass for my liking.Recommended for anyone interested in a not so typical carnival story featuring grotesque characters who do all kinds of vile things.
