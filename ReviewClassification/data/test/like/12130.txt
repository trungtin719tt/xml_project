Rosamunde Pilcher received a challenge from her publisher, Tom Dunne. He wanted her to write: "A big fat novel for women. A good read. Something to get the teeth into. And something, above all, that taps into your life and the experiences of your generation."She had never written such a book. All of her novels, previously, had taken no more than three months each to write. Ideas were floating about in her head. She came up with three themes: the lives of the upper-class Bohemians who had always had a place in the culture of England; the disastrous effect that the promise of a substantial inheritance can have on a family; and, a need to write about the days before WWII.Pilcher has risen to the task. She has crafted this beautiful story about the last days of Penelope Keeling. Keeling is the daughter of Lawrence Stern, a painter from the Victorian Era, whose paintings have lately come back into vogue, commanding huge prices at the auction houses. Penelope is a widow and has three children: the tiresome Nancy, the cool-headed Olivia, the materialistic Noel. The paintings of Lawrence Stern have everybody's attention.The plot not only highlights the life of Penelope but also fleshes out Olivia beautifully. Yes, I had to put up with the immaturity of Nancy and Noel, but the contrast allowed Penelope and Olivia to look all that much better.The book held my rapt attention throughout its 500+ pages. I highly recommend it for those who love to experience the ins and outs of family drama.5 stars
