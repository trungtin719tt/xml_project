I loved this book! Such a sweet story. I couldn't help comparing it withA Tree Grows in Brooklynbecause #1 they both have 'tree' in the title and #2 they're both a "snapshot" of life as told through the eyes of a young person. But where Tree was such a chore to read, Cold Sassy was a pleasure. The characters were vivid and fun and while they had their share of troubles they didn't drag down the entire book. To top it all off I got to read with a southern accent, yes!!
