I finished this book &amp; am glad for the chance to take it off my to-read list. What a treasure.So much of this book has relevance in my life today. In the three months leading up to our big move to Europe I had everything planned out like clockwork. Not knowing all that would happen on the "other side of the ocean" or how long it would take to get settled, I had to leave it up to a flexible plan. However, sometimes our "flexible" plans are clung to too tightly and then unnecessary stress occurs. Like she says, "Europeans today are enjoying the moment even if it means merely a walk in the country on Sunday or sipping a cup of black coffee at a cafe." I'm having a lesson taught to me in this timeframe of my life to sit and enjoy the moment. No one is in a hurry here...why am I? Habit? Generational? Not trusting enough?Knowing that everything in my life is exactly the way it should be...why push, fight, or resist? Thoughts to ponder.Anne says, "It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel."We never know what lies ahead but staying centered no matter what comes our way is so important. In my mind the way to do that is being anchored in our Higher Source (God). When life pulls and tugs at me I know where my anchor is grounded and it helps knowing He cares and wants to help. We don't have to weather these storms alone.
