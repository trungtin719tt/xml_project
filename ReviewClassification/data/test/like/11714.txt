I enjoyed Kingsolver's Poisonwood Bible so much that for some reason I delayed reading this one (does that make sense?). I just liked the idea of another unread novel by her being out there, waiting for me to read -- something I was saving like a piece of rich dark chocolate.Her descriptions of the natural world are lovely. The relationships are complex and sexy and intriguing. My favorite story line is the romance between Deanna and Eddie. It reminds me of the romance in "The River Why", another book I will write about here on goodreads (someday).Coyotes play a prominent role in the book. I grew up falling asleep to the sound of coyotes howling (whenever I stayed with my grandparents). It is an eerie sound, almost human. This is a book that can make you love coyotes and chestnut trees and even our fellow humans (with all of our quirks and failings and missteps along the way).Here's the final paragraph (it's not a plot spoiler):"Solitude is a human presumption. Every quiet step is thunder to beetle life underfoot, a tug of impalpable thread on the web pulling mate to mate and predator to prey, a beginning or an end. Every choice is a world made new for the chosen."As I expected, I am feeling reader's remorse. There are no more Kingsolver titles out there for me to read. Yet. Write quickly Barbara. I miss you already.
