RHAGE's story is only $1.99 on Amazon right now. One of my favorites in the series. I even like Mary! :Phttps://www.amazon.com/Lover-Eternal-...Previous post:This is my second time reading this, and while I did skim through theLesserssections, I am keeping my original rating. TheLessersserve to give the Brothers a villain to battle and some ass to kick. I didn't feel it was necessary to re-read those sections. But the romance between Rhage and Mary was still fantastic and perfect for a good PNR.If you don't like romance and get annoyed by tropes, you'll probably hate this. It's got the mega-alpha male who is stalkerish in the beginning and the seemingly submissive female who ends up being strong and his equal. Mary did have a legitimate reason for her low self-esteem and doubts. And Rhage had good reasons for the way he acted before meeting Mary too. I am much more lenient for some reason with PNR compared to regular romances and this one still works for me.I might add more later, but this is still a favorite old-school PNR comfort read for me! :)Original post:While I wait... and wait... and wait... for my re-read ofDark LoverwithSarah(who will probably hate it) and theMacHalo groupon October 22, 2015, I've decided to re-read Rhage's book.YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS. Let the sexy times begin.*Image from Deviant Art by michy0828.
