4 EVIL CLIFFHANGER stars!!!OMG! OMG! OMG! I really THOUGHT I was prepared for this book's cliffhanger ending. I was wrong. I was so, so wrong. I was NOT prepared for this story's ending. Not at all!!! I'm devastated and anxious and want to read Origin right now! Plus,(view spoiler)[I'M SO FREAKING PISSED AT BLAKE I COULD SCREAM! I hope he gets what's coming to him. I truly HATE his character.(hide spoiler)]. I should have waited until Opal was released before starting this book. Oh boy, I HATE CLIFFHANGERS! I hate them, I hate them, I hate them!!I was going to write a review but I think my original comments express my feelings perfectly. I LOVE this series but could kick myself for not listening to all my Goodreads friends who warned me to wait until Origin was released before read this book.After this ending, I'm in need of a major fluffy, fun, and steamy read. Lol.
