A long, beautiful, hilarious, vile, cynical rant about everything and everyone. Bile drips from every page.The author-surrogate travels from Paris to the hellscape of the first world war to the dank oppressive heat of a colonial jungle, and the gleaming lonely crowds of New York and Detroit. The author has a keen eye for the ugliness and bitterness and loneliness of modern living, and takes his time to appreciate and lovingly describe each thing he hates.This is a fascinating book. Christ, what an asshole.
