My reaction to this book was a lot more favorable than Stacey's --but I do have to agree with some of her criticisms. Because of his "hard" sci-fi orientation, Crichton insisted on trying to extrapolate an explanation for time-travel from existing science, his vehicle being quantum theory. Since this is too complex and counter-intuitive for most people to understand (and some of us suspect it of being a bunch of hooey anyway!), the "explanation" doesn't serve much purpose, and does wind up being a "jumble." Time-travel is inherently the stuff of soft science fiction; the father of the subgenre, H. G. Wells, demonstrated that you don't need to "explain" it to get readers to accept it. Crichton should have taken a leaf out of his book. And the characters here are not the most sharply drawn in the genre (though some are more so than others, and there are a couple of conversations which are really excellent revelations of character, by the "show, don't tell" method). The ending does have a cinematic quality, though whether this is a flaw or not depends on your tastes. (Ironically, the last part of the movie version leaves out several of the best parts.)In the main, though, I personally thought the book succeeds well as an adventure story, where a group of friends have to find resources of loyalty, courage and ingenuity in themselves to survive, and to help each other survive. LikeJurassic Park, this novel also sounds a well-warranted cautionary note about the potential of self-serving Big Business to debase science as an instrument of profit for the few at the expense of others. The violence is not gratuitous (although there's a lot of it), the time travelers don't engage in illicit sex, and the language isn't noticeably bad. (Crichton's villains use the f-word a few times; but rather than encouraging it, this comes across as a reflection of the kinds of bad qualities the readersdon'twant to emulate!)
