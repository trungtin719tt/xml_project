This book is simply genius. I've not read it for a few years now but I remember taking it out of the library again and again, laughing out every time.The book is a picture book but with lots of different fairy tales that have been twisted and warped into a fabulous and hilarious read.You think you know classic tales like the Gingerbread Man, Jack and the Beanstalk and Little Red Riding Hood? Think again. With clever tweaks and twists, some of them are linked together in an interesting and unique way.In summary, if you haven't read this book before and are going to, prepare to have tears of laughter rolling down your face as you hopefully enjoy it as much as I did.
