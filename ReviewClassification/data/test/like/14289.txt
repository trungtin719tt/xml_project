I boughtThe Seven Habitsat a yard sale for $1 with little knowledge of its contents. Years later, when my life dipped to a low ebb of meaning and motivation, I picked it off the shelf in hopes of finding a spark. Inside I found wisdom, compassion, a direct approach and a love of humanity.The result wasn't immediately transformative. The methods and techniques Covey espouses didn't fall into place and turn me into a whirlwind of positive productivity. Reading The Seven Habits was just one of many moderate steps on a journey that, years on, still stretches endlessly into the horizon.But the part that had the greatest effect on me, looking back, is the notion of the Personal Mission Statement; a written representation of who you are and who you want to be. It's a credo or philosophy, written to reflect your values and edited over time to refine the edges of your philosophy. It demonstrates the power of organizing what you feel and writing it down or speaking it out loud.And with that I share my Personal Mission Statement; consulted often, edited occasionally, some points followed more consistently than others.-When something seems wrong about how I pattern my life, I will analyze that pattern and change if it makes sense.-I matter to others and they matter to me.-I will look before I leap, but sometimes I will leap.-I will write down my ideas.-When I lose myself in reverie, I will turn to my to-do list rather than internet engagement.-I will continue to write even if my content is receiving diminishing attention.-I will carve out time each week to be around other people.-I will favor truth over cleverness in my articulation.-I will maintain my health through strong nutrition and consistent activity.I will leave room for flights of fancy.-I will leave the house with the intention of being early.-I will act when I know there is something to do.-I will write events on the calendar as they come up.-I will minimize my multitasking.-Not everything I say has to sound clever; I will make an effort to giving encouragement and obeying social graces.-I shall ask for help and I shall offer it.-When I wake up I will engage my legs or mind promptly.-The names of others matter and I will learn them.-When life gets stressful, I will harness that stress.-I will speak well of people behind their backs.-There are stories everywhere and I shall find them.-I will respond to people online promptly; say within an hour or when I know what to say.-I will go to bed when I feel tired.-Not every big step will take me far.-My Checklists serve me, not the other way around.
