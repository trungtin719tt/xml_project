Okay, some who have looked at my other reviews will immediately note I gave this book 5 stars which I noted earlier I save for very special books. I plan to give the Dresden books (so far anyway) 5 stars. Why? Well while they are not Dumas or Dickens (but then again...I'm not sure I'd regularly be giving Dickens 5 stars, how much Dickens can we all really take anyway???) these are wonderful absorbing reads. Special Books.I won't be giving a long synopsis of each book... I will say they are an original idea in what is rapidly becoming a glutted genre. That would be "Urban Fantasy". So far I've found a lot of Urban Fantasy I like, and a lot more I'd pitch on the discard pile of literary history.Dresden is a wizard...he maintains a downtown office and advertises in the yellow pages (no parties please). He has problems with the Sidhe (pronounced "Shee" ) (some would say "fairy" but that is insulting to the very powerful Sidhe royalty...like calling Queen Elizabeth a "babe" or worse). It seems his mother had some sort of dealings with the Sidhe and left him a sort of Sidhe godmother (Bad fairy godmother????)... And that's only the tip of the iceberg.No spoilers...but in Storm Front Dresden will meet a sorcerer who has some extremely violent and nasty tendencies, magic drugs, biased superiors, and....... well, anymore and I might give a spoiler...read the book, you'll love it!If your only exposure to Dresden has been the short lived TV series then you have a great surprise in store and a whole list of great books to look forward to (in a way I envy you). While the TV series wasn't awful and I too mourned it's demise (there is so little on the idiot box that actually makes it to a decent standard of "watchability" [made up word, I know:]) it doesn't come close to the books...This/these are wonderful books. Definitely 5 Stars.
