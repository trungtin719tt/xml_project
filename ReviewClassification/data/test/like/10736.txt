What an amazing story! I only regret that I didn't live in the time of Seabiscuit's glory! I fell in love with this horse! I have recently taken riding lessons (English)and this story was more meaningful because of the little experience I have had with horses. I have always loved this animal since my youth so reading a "horse" book sounded like fun. Being a true story made it a remarkable read! I liked the way it was written (by someone who knows horses inside and out). Very beautiful and descriptive. I enjoyed all the old photographs throughout the book that put you there in 1936. I learned about the early automobile days in SF and the fact that racing was huge in the early 20th century. I grew up in Nor Cal and appreciated the different, familiar towns, roads, and history. (Willits, CA)I was reminded of the hard life of the jockey, the pressure to loose weight before a race, their poverty, the extreme athletic expectations. I loved each character and felt for them so much that I cried at the end! The ability of an author to emotionally link the reader to the characters in such a way is always amazing to me! An inspiring story that will prove to you that no matter what odds are against you, if you want something bad enough, it can be yours! What looked very flawed on the outside had power and drive that won the world over! Never underestimate the under dog!
