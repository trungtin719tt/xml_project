I think I moderately enjoyed this book as a 20-something young mother. But with an extra goodly number of years on my body, I now adore this book.I feel keenly that Anne Morrow Lindbergh is a kindred spirit.And if there are as many women as she insinuates who also feel that desperate need to "get away" in order to recharge and refuel-- so that they may come home ready to give again ... then there are more women like me than I thought. I wish I knew where they were...In any case, it has reaffirmed to me that my desire for solitude is not selfish-- but healthy.And I am grateful to have a family who lets me do this once or twice a year.6 weeks and counting until that eagerly anticipated solitary weekend...
