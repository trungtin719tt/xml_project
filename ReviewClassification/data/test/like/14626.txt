Most love stories happen before and end with marriage, and the story ends and they've supposedly lived happily ever after. This book, however, shows that even after the rocky path that follows marriage, there's still a loving ending.The concept of the book is so beautiful, but the way it was presented was very difficult to get into at first. I also found that after reading many of his books, they start to become very similar, and predictable.The story was incredibly heartfelt, nonetheless, and I was so touched.
