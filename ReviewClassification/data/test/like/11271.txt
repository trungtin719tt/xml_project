This novel is a brilliant explication of what can happen when two desperate people's lives collide and become entwined. Dubus introduces us to two characters who couldn't be more at odds - Kathy Niccolo, a Saugus, MA native who has moved to California to escape shades of her drug-addled, under-achieving past, and Massoud Behrani, a hardworking, regimented ex-Colonel who fled Iran after a political uprising, who is struggling to maintain a semblance of dignity in a country that has little opportunity for certain immigrants. What brings these two together is the ownership rights to a small bungalow in Northern California. Dubus' pacing is impressive; with each page one reads, the tension and desperation of each character's lives creep into the reader's consciousness. These aren't necessarily likable characters - but what Dubus succeeds in doing is creating such a believable, involved psychological portrait of these two people, that pretty early on, the novel becomes a page-turner. It's very easy to get engaged in this book - so much so, it serves as a great subway read. The writing is somewhat straightforward, with minimal literary flourishes, but the strong story and intense psychological portraits make up for any lack in beautiful writing.
