This book goes on my top 5 favorite books. Sarah is my hero. This book was so sad about the harsh realities of living in those times in the west. Almost every chapter my heart broke. I loved the romance and practicality of her marriage. She amazed me with her tenacity for life. And how she made the good times help her overcome the hard ones.She was a survival specilist. Her best characteristic I thought was her willingness to do whatever needed to be done. I related to Sarah with her husband Jack. I know Jack is a fictional character but sometimes it described my husband and our relationship perfectly. Which is why I thin I loved this book and that character so much. I think I cried for an hour after I finished this book. Anyone who is a mother can truely relate to the love and fear she felt for her children. Its the same things we want for our children to be.I love the relationship she hadwith her sister in law Savannah. There differences made them closer as both qualities were needed.Loved this bookI loved it more the 2nd time. I am not sure if I really want to read Sarah's Quilt... I am still in love with Jack and don't this i am ready for someone new.
