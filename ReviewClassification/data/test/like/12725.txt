These books are strange. Unique. Whenever I thought of urban fantasy before reading this series, I thought of cities and, well, urban life that would include crazy magical creatures. This is the only series I have seen that is set in the South, and it is a lot of fun. The "Southiness" of it cracks me up because I have lived in Texas for the past 18 years and can appreciate the references.Here are some of my favorite Southernisms:The expressions. Southerners are super expressive in their language. They have little sayings for everything and it can take a bit to get what they mean. It is also funny to ask your Southern friend what the hell they are talking about and having them not really know why it's a saying, but that their granny used it and they picked it up.He'd been around for donkey's years...a long time - duh!my pride had risen up and whopped me in the face...getting "whopped" is a thing. So is "opening a can of whoop-ass...This didn't seem like a very dignified or meaningful place to die. This was no Alamo!Remember the Alamo!!! (as a Texan, I am obligated to say this.)buzzed like bees in a jar...this one, I haven't heard before. I need to live here another 18 years or so...It was as hot as six shades of hell in Dallas...(it's also hotter than hell in Houston, where I live. And the mosquito is our state bird)"I'm just as tasty as a big eclair... though at the moment I feel more like boudain"...(boudin is a cajun sausage in Louisiana that is made with pig and dirty rice. Sometimes it will include blood, but I've never seen it that way. I'm not a fan, personally.)Bless his heart...(as mentioned earlier, this expression gives you license to say any horrible thing you want as long as you utter it before or after saying it.)The other thing I liked in this book was Eric. He is getting pretty awesome as a character. I don't get why Sookie wants boring Bill when she can have Eric the Viking. Doesn't the name itself even say "Choose me"? Cuz, when I think Viking, I think Thor. And, when I think Thor, I think Chris Hemsworth - obviously!(no, I do not mention Chris Hemsworth too often in my reviews. Shut up!)So, there really is no choice involved here.But, the guy who plays Erik on the television show will do as well.yeah, he'll do...Some of my favorite Erik moments:When he apologized to Sookie for her getting hurt by the fairie:"Angelic Sookie, vision of love and beauty, I am prostrate that the wicked evil maenad violated your smooth and voluptuous body, in an attempt to deliver a message to me."When Sookie asked him to play a gay man to help her at the "party":he wore a pink tank top and Lycra leggings. They were pink and aqua... "Wow," I said, since it was all I could think of to say. "Wow. That's some outfit..." He fluttered his eyelashes at me. Eric was definitely enjoying this..."Hey, our hair's the same color," I said..."Sure is, girlfriend." Eric grinned at me...So, the actual story, in this book is that Eric needs Sookie and Bill to travel to Dallas and find one of his vampires that has gone missing. They end up getting mixed up with a crazy, anti-vampire cult that uses a mixture of religious fanaticism and fear to try and eradicate vampires. They are hate-mongers to the extreme. There is also a murder of one of Sookie's co-workers, and an angry maenad - which is fae or some other mystic creature that feeds off of pride and drunkenness. There is a good amount of action and murder - important for these kinds of books. There is also a lot of blood. Which makes sense, really. The hate-cult was a lot of fun to read because of the level of insanity. It made me think of those idiots with the anti-gay signs who say that God hates gays. If only we had a bunch of vampires to take those guys out, huh?
