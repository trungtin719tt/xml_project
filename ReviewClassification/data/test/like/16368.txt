I loved this book. The story of this sad and lonely man who finds love and redemption when he adopts a girl was just lovely to read.Eliot took her protagonist from a tight knit and religious community to a solitary existence and then into the hearts of another community. She explored the theme of individual versus community so beautifully. At the time this book was written a person's village was extremely important; a person's identity was provided by the community. We see this most definitely when Silas is the outsider, as he seems to lack any identity. It feels as though the connection to community is not voluntary. It is there whether we like it or not.Silas Marner worked a loom as a weaver and it was such a lovely symbol of Eliot's storytelling. She had so many threads in this story that she wove together perfectly in the end.
