Second book of 2016 DONE! Really enjoyed this one for what it is.... A fun sexy paranormal new adult book! It's short and gets to the point, it's exactly what I wanted and kept me reading into the weeeeeee hours of the night/morning. Good thing I have the next 4 books in the series, cause this one ended way too soon!
