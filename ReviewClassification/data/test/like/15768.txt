In this saga, Grisham examines more closely than in his other novels the process of choosing a jury that can best respond to both the plantiff and the defendent without filling the 12 chairs with people who have too much prejudice for either side. There are people hired to help in the jury picking process, and they study every aspect of a potential juror's life. The culprit on trial in The Runaway Jury is the tobacco industry and the plaintiff is someone who lost a family member to lung cancer due to smoking. The process by which a team manages to maneuver a jury in a series of clever and sneaky moves is really interesting. In the film version, it was made when school shootings were more of an emotional threat to the country than the sale of cigarettes, and it changed the guilty topic of the trial from smoking to gun control. I think this was very effective. Whether it's cigarettes or guns, there is going to be a lot of emotion among jurors, and these 12 people hold virtually all the power for the outcome. This book explains in a most interesting way how juries can be manipulated by both sides, and how smart, but unscrupulous and manipulative, people can benefit in a monetary way from their tricks.
