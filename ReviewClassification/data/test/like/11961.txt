I do re-read this book every couple of years. Probably because it was my first glimpse of Becky Bloomwood and I liked her a lot. I remember being in my 20s and spending with my credit card like I wasn't going to have to pay the bill. And I remember the juggling I did to pay down bills and the stress I would feel when I had to choose between eating something that was not soup or paying my JC Penney card down (starting off in government I had to buy new clothes...seriously people, instead of a wedding trousseau, we need to fund young men/women clothes when they go out into the workforce) so I wouldn't get a screeching call about being sent to collections.What makes "Confessions" so fun for me is that Becky is a mess. She's working at a job she hates (writer at Successful Saving) while trying to pay down her bills due to how much she loves shopping. And it's not just Becky loves shopping for clothes and accessories. It's pretty much any old thing. This of course is when Becky loses me cause I loathe shopping at the mall and every Christmas I promise myself I am just going to buy online and ship to my family. And every year I wait to late to do that (delivery fees are criminal) so I have to brave the crowds and try my best to not hip check people into kiosks.While Becky doesn't love the job she is in, she does love she gets to go to presentations dealing with banks and investment firms. Due to Becky not really paying attention at her job, she realizes a tip she gives a family friend could end up harming them and starts to get her life back on track.We do get a whole case of characters in this one who we will continue to read about throughout the series.We have Becky talking about Luke Brandon who I would say is an earlier prototype of Christian Grey without the BDSM.Becky lives with her best friend and flatmate Suze who manages to have her life somewhat together more than Becky.And we also have Becky's parents who are just as messy as Becky. Becky's neighbor's son who everyone thinks that Becky is into.I will admit there is very little development of the characters besides Becky and Suze and Becky's parents in this one. Luke is very one dimensional and stayed that way for me throughout most of the books. Besides being rich and tall, I don't get what was so interesting about him.The writing is okay. Nothing spectacular, but honestly, sometimes I want to read a fluffy book that makes me root for a character. Do I think this is going to go down as some classic over the years? Doubtful? But it is an enjoyable book.
