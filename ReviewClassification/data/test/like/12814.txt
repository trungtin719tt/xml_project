Borges is a name that's thrown about quite frequently in 'intellectual' circles. I heard his name from a friend who used to constantly claim that Borges was the greatest author never to win the Nobel Prize. I was intrigued and bought this particular book, an English translation from the original Spanish of this Argentinian writer.First thing I realized was, that the guy who recommended Borges had never really read a word of Borges! Because he never told me what these stories were *really* about, and was probably fibbing from second-hand accounts.These are interesting exercises, experiments in narrative structure and ideas. Borges must have been infernally lazy :), in a genius kind of way. One of his pet plot devices is apocryphal book reviews. The exploration of Infinity makes an appearance in many of his more famous stories. And so do simulation, recursion and many ideas that perhaps software engineers are more comfortable with but which don't often appear in the realm of literature.Borges' life reflected the irony of his books. When he was almost blind, he was made the head of Buenos Aires' national library. The irony was not lost on him.
