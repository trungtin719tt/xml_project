It is true that when we are dealing with such an equally popular and admired author, we expect something extraordinary and therefore it spoils the effect of discovery. It was my first Neruda; a bilingual collection (where I had fun reading also the original version) which consists of three small collections of different forms. A very simple writing, but which reaches greatness, where the woman is in the center; all types of women and all types of metaphors. Neruda has managed to express herself around such common subjects as love and woman without falling into bad taste and without stumbling, as if he walked acrobatically on the blade of a knife. Personally, I keep a very beautiful memory of this reading; I enjoyed a lot of metaphors and puns.Lisbon Book-Fair 2019
