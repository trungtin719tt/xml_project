"Psychotic" isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.Seriously, this book is WEIRD. But, having said that, it's what made it so entertaining. The story never really WENT anywhere, though the ending was a surprise. The whole book was random, jumping from one thing to another - choking here, going to work, visiting his mom, going into his past...and there was a lot of pretty graphic areas regarding sex. On the whole, I pretty much hated the main character, he seemed like such a pig, but at the same time you enjoy reading about his demented and twisted life.Anyway, it was a pretty good book. Don't read it if you're easily offended!
