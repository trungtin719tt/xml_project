When I finished this book, I jumped up and down on the bed, tossed junk on the floor and screamed. I pulled at my hair and threw pillows mercilessly at the wall, annoyed that they didn't BREAK the wall and only landed with a less than satisfying thud before tumbling to the ground.This was an excellent book, as all the others are, with deep and interesting characters, character growth, a brave new world to explore with excellent writing, as I've come to expect from Ms. Moning. Rich in language (though I wish she'd ease up on two words: demarcation and irrevocably (I wish OTHER authors would stop abusing the latter as well but that's a story for another day)).The book is fast paced, action packed and full of the kind of rich, original and immersive story each of the previous books have enjoyed.I thoroughly recommend this series.Except for the freakin' endings! This book has the worst case of cliff-hanger fever I've ever seen! KMM, the last book better wrap up nice and neat or I am seriously going to lose my cool.
