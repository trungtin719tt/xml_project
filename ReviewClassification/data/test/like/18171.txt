One part travel guide to preWWII Crete, Zorba the Greek is a beautifully crafted and engaging story about the relationships between a man, his mentor, and his spirituality. The story is told in the first person by an unnamed and introverted narrator. He is an individual who aspires to be more, as a writer, as an entrepreneur, and as a man. All of his years have been spent in study, appreciating other artist's work, developing the mind, and avoiding any exploration of the ways of the heart. He wants to grow in any or all these directions, but his confidence is weak.Enter Alexis Zorba, an unskilled laborer hired by the narrator to work in his lignite mine (coal), and a man who has devoted his life to the ardent pursuit of one dream after another. Zorba is full of stories and music, joys and sorrows. First an employee, he quickly rises to the status of confidant, friend, and foreman of the mine. For the narrator, it is an increasingly dependent relationship. In response Zorba raises the ante, patiently encouraging, cajoling, and directing his friend the narrator to open his heart and pursue a sexual relationship with the alluring village widow. As the story unfolds the narrator falls in love but, loses the prize.Recovering from his defeat, Zorba continues to rise in the esteem of the narrator, from mentor to spiritual guide. They continue to live in the village, work the mine, and even expand their business enterprise, only to fail once again and in spectacular fashion. It is a story full of joy, mirth, and sadness, with wonderful insights into being who you are and then becoming more.
