I loved this story.I love taking responsibility for my own life and outcome.I love doing what I want to do, and leaving others free to do what they want.I loved the analogy about all the creatures clinging to the sticks and rocks in the river, but one was tired of clinging and let go to follow the path the river led it down.I loved the point that freedom is watching "your own films" not someone else's films, and the introspection that resulted when I pondered the films I actually like and what that says about life choices.I want to live freely and happily, to give up the boredom.I love"What the caterpillarcalls the end of the world,the master calls abutterfly."I guess, in short, I loved this book :)
