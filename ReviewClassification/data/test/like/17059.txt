like a 3.7 rounded up.The very first Sherlock Holmes story, readingA Study in Scarletseems to be appropriate at this time of year, since it was published inBeeton's Christmas Annualin 1887. I didn't know that when I'd decided to read it, but I'd say that's a nice coincidence, considering that I finished it on 25th of December, some 130 years later.A Study in Scarletis an unusual novel -- in a big way, it doesn't really cohere like a novel should. The first part of this book brings together Holmes and Watson who both need roommates. Holmes introduces himself as a "consulting detective," stepping in to provide his expertise when government and private detectives "are at fault." Many of his clients come from "private inquiry agents," from whom he collects fees. Shortly after Holmes dazzles Watson with his "intuition," his "special knowledge," and his "train of reasoning," Holmes is called to the scene of a "bad business" at 3 Lauriston Gardens. There is very little to go on at the scene -- a dead body and few clues, the word "RACHE" written in blood on the wall -- but after a short time, Holmes manages to bring the guilty man to his very doorstep, and even knows his name. Leaving the reader wondering how the hell he did that, the next page takes us to "The Great Alkali Plain," and an intriguing story involving Mormons in Utah, a man with an orphaned little girl, and ultimately, a quest for revenge. Then it's back to the final act with Dr. Watson and Holmes for the dazzling solution. It is a flawed story in terms of its telling, but as Julian Symons notes in his bookBloody Murder, it doesn't really matter because "Sherlock Holmes triumphs as a character from the moment we meet him."And that for me, in a nutshell, is why I've loved Holmes since I read this book as a teenager; it's why I keep reading Holmes over and over again -- it's that first meeting that really sealed the deal. I fell in love with his mind -- there's just no better way of putting it.The introduction in this book (the Penguin edition) is by Iain Sinclair, and it is excellent, making me think ofA Study in Scarletin an entirely new way. I won't go into it, but if you can get this edition, it's well worth having just for that.If your first experience of Holmes and Watson is from the fast-paced, high-tech BBC series with Benedict Cumberbatch, well, the stories might come across as a bit tame. The luckiest people, I think, are the ones who've read the stories first and then watch them play out across the screen.recommended. beyond highly recommended, even with its flaws.http://www.crimesegments.com/2017/12/...
