I love the whole darn series (okay, so I haven't read Many Waters yet - I confess). But the first three are fantastic reads. I also confess that I love people who weave a tale with an alterior motive that I agree with. Yes, I understand why it comforts me, but I don't care - it's still an awesome book!!! I even wanted to name my kittens Fortinbras and Ananda (although my husband won that name battle, *sigh*).
