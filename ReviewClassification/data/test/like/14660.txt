I'm beginning to put in more work in my hobby - my solitary one, reading - than I've put in my career. 400 pages of this stuff is the strong stuff.I have little to analyze here. That is because a lot of the things that can be construed, can be true of any book. Like Sam Harris said, even a cookbook, if improperly analyzed, can yield truths that can seem profoundly benevolent.If I say that the mixture of oil and aniseed symbolizes the purity of the cookbook, that's not conductive to a balanced and healthy autopsy. Emma is a frivolous character, with flaws, but appears and is regarded as felicitous.Emma is a book that Jane Austen might have written in Pride and Prejudice, but the differences are markedly dissimilar enough.I am beginning to change. This book would never have got 4 stars from me in 2012. The broadening of my horizons is something private. Suffice to say, Emma is about pleasure rather than stuffy austerity. Let's leave it at that.
