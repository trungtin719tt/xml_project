in 11th grade my life changed. i went vegan, then got really preachy with it, then lost friends, missed my partner (long distance relationship), got depressed, then ignored everyone and read like 10 l'engle books in a row all day long in school and at home. l'engle is great for escaping. plus the themes in her Time series are beautiful and were part of shaping my philosophy and worldview at the time.
