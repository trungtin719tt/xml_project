After watching the movie again... I'm torn. It feels like the movie and the book almost tell different stories, or at the very least maybe they tell the same story in very different ways. There's a lot in the book that either takes a backseat or isn't in the movie at all, and vice-versa. I think the biggest difference is that the movie simplifies a lot of the book's exposition, and gives us more of the Claire/Marek story, which I do appreciate because that bit of the ending felt a smidge rushed in the novel.At the end of the day, either way you take this in, Crichton is still a genius and this is extremely entertaining.PS: This movie basically kickstarted my love of Gerard Butler, so I'll always love it.
