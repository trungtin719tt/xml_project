I have always loved fairy tales. Call it clinging to childhood, Peter Pan syndrome,whatever. The magical realm has seen me through from the dreams of childhood to the wishful thinking of adolescence to the often harsh realities that are part and parcel of being an adult.Practical Magic is the story of three generations of the Owens women.The aunts, elderly sisters who take in and raise their orphaned nieces. Feared and often publicly shunned,but furtively sought after in the gloaming of the day by those who wish for who or what they cannot attain for themselves.The nieces, Sally and Gillian. Mercilessly teased as youngsters and shunned as they enter adolescence they rely on one another while they long for "normal" lives.Different as day and night they follow divergent paths that ultimately leads them straight back to what they fled.Sally's daughters, Antonia and Kylie. Thanks to their mother, they live in a world devoid of magic and all it's vagaries. Or do they? As they leave childhood and take their first tentative steps into the whirlpool of the teenage years, the past that their mother fled comes rushing back to claim them.I so enjoyed this book. It wasn't until a couple years ago that I was aware that there was a book related to the popular movie. Once I see a movie based on a book, I rarely read the book. How unfair I have been! Comparisons of the two are truly unfair. While the movie would surely not have been made if there wasn't a book, I believe each should stand alone.I enjoyed them differently, each giving me something special to take away from the experience.
