William Blake was an English painter and printmaker, as well as a poet and social critic. In 1789 he printed a small number of his illustrated books of poetry which were colored with paint by hand. The pages of Blake's lovely "Songs of Innocence and Experience" can be seen on the British Library's website:https://www.bl.uk/collection-items/wi...The Songs of Innocence depict the world in a pure, childlike innocence. The Songs of Experience look at the world from the view of an adult who can see the darker side of life. Some of the poems are critical of the institution of the church, the government, and society's lack of concern for the unfortunate. It's especially interesting to read his paired poems that look at the same theme, one poem through the eyes of innocence and the other through the eyes of experience.While I enjoyed some of Blake's poems, I was even more attracted to his artistic work which complemented it so well. As a combined visual and literary experience "Songs of Innocence and Experience" is a special gem.
