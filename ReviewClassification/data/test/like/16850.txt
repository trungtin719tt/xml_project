I read this in seventh grade (many years ago) and it was the first full length 'classic' novel I had ever read. I just fell in love with this kind of writing. I have seen so many complaints about Cooper, but this lead me to start reading Dickens and many others Victorian writers.LOTM is great adventure stuff. And it has the most fantastic hero long before the world had ever heard of James Bond. Hawkeye (a.k.a Leatherstocking, The Pathfinder, The Deerslayer, etc.) is the smoothest, coolest, best shooting, wisest, funniest, and toughest hero I can ever remember. I just loved him. In fact, knowing that he finally dies in the book The Prarie, I still won't read that book. I suppose I'll have to wait until the winter of my life to read that. I just hate to see him get so old and die.One last comment. The only character to 'outcool' Hawkeye is his companion, Chingachgook. There is an added mysteriousness to him that makes him the ultimate special forces fighter, and this was long before ninjas became the rage.
