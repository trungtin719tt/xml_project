This book, is my second Kate Morton novel, and I'm glad to say, that she has not left me disappointed. In fact, I ordered another of her novels online, immediately after finishing this one. Anyone that knows me well enough will know that I love mooching around beautiful stately homes and gardens which have a gothic appeal to them. That is also a reason I am a dedicated member of the National Trust. I can spend many, many happy hours at their sites just exploring the wonderful gardens and homes that they have took on and cared for, for many years. That is why I have so much love for this kind of read. The Forgotten Garden is about a garden that is hidden and without saying too much about the plot there is a secret that is discovered based on this garden. It may come across as a bit twee or dull even, but I promise, it most certainly isn't.I think I actually enjoyed this more than "The house at Riverton". I felt that this one was smooth flowing, and there were many twists and turns that just totally took me by surprise.However, as much as I like the narration jumping I also didn't like it too. There were parts that were pretty confusing jumping from the past, to the present day. While I totally understand why Morton did that, I do think parts left the reader rather perplexed, as to what was going on. That is my reason for knocking off one star, otherwise this was certainly a five-star read for me.The character development within this book was creative, interesting and rather haunting really. In parts of this book there was an eerie feel to it, and the descriptions of Blackhurst Manor and the gardens were that detailed and real, I felt as if I was really there. For that to happen to me that takes talent and Kate Morton definitely has that. I'm quite sad, that I've finished this book actually.I can't wait to read more from this author!
