I am reading this series for the second time now. It has been something like 8-9 years since I last readThe Valley of Horses, and I still love it. I am an earth scientist by education (geologist) and profession (water resources/environmental), and I just love Ms. Auel's attention to detail when it comes to botany, animals, and the ecology of the environments that she writes about. Additionally, she is very well versed in the latest advances in anthropology, archaeology, human evolution, paleo-climatology, paleontology, and so forth. Some may find the novel's descriptions of the ice-age environments, Ayla's interest in plants, etc. to border on minutiae; but not me. I am truly fascinated with this stuff!Reading each of these books has caused me to sit back and reflect on our own human origins. How did we actually become the species that we are today? Ms. Auel, to her great credit, gives us a 'field guide,' if you will, for a period of human history in what is now western Russia and Europe that is as plausible as any that I'm aware of.It is not so much that you have to suspend belief and accept that her protagonists, Ayla and Jondalar, discovered everything and rewrote the course of human history; you just have to realize that the narrative that Ms. Auel has constructed is comprised of a series of monumental events that allowed anatomically modern humans to be successful; much of which has been validated through advances in archaeology and anthropological research. Her characters, Ayla, Jondalar, and others are merely representatives of those nameless individuals that did so much to ensure the survival of the human race. Someone during that period of time invented the spear-thrower (atlatl); someone probably did begin to domesticate animals like wolves or horses. Bands of humans did live together on the Ukrainian and Russian steppes hunting the great migratory herds of animals; developing sophisticated cultures and societies whilst scratching out a living in incredibly harsh conditions.These stories that Ms. Auel has fashioned into her five novels (so far) almost have the feel of being one the great mythologies that have been handed down over time. The amazing story of young Ayla's lonely journey to her valley, her survival, her domestication of 'Whinny,' and her eventual meeting of Jondalar is just wonderful and thought-provoking; and a story that resonates and has meaning for all humans today. It is worth realizing, every once in a while, that we all, every living thing on the planet, really are the 'Earth's Children.'
