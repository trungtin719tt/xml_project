I have known Shakespeare wrote sonnets. I had also bought a pocket book of them from my visit to Shakespearean birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon. But honestly, I really didn't give much thought on reading it until I was impelled by a group read. I'm really glad that I read it and thankful to the group and the member who nominated it.Shakespeare is universally acclaimed for his plays. His use of satire, wit, clever plots and darker and tragic elements have attracted the readers. And I feel that this attraction for his plays has considerably shadowed his sonnets and as such they have been comparatively less known. Because of this reason I was utterly surprised to find the sonnets beautiful, lyrical, intelligent and absorbing.Before I began reading the sonnets, I thought them to be individual ones. Here too I was in for another surprise. They are not individual sonnets but a connected and continued 154 sonnets which tells a story of love, devotion, jealousy, lust, separation and pining among other things. Thus as in his plays, Shakespeare tells us a story through his sonnets too. And I must say he tells the story with a passion and an earnestness.The narrator is a male poet and the bulk of the sonnets are devoted to the poet's love and devotion to a beautiful youth, his jealousies, and his pain at their separation. And the rest of the sonnets are devoted to his love, devotion, lust and jealousy for his mistress. Interestingly, the sonnets address a poet love for a male and a female. The narrator being a male and a poet, I did wonder whether Shakespeare was modelling the narrator on himself. I was really surprised by the bold venture of Shakespeare given that these were written in the late 16th century. I wonder whether no one thought of them scandalous at the time.Through his sonnets, I saw a different side of Shakespeare, a one I haven't seen through his plays. It was pleasing to know a passionate and emotional side existed in him in addition to his intelligence and creativity.
