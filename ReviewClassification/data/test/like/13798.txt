Re-read during work breaks :)The best Spanish language author I have found so far."The Library of Babel" is the clear winner for me, and reveals Borges' power to engage the imagination to create such fantastical imagery, despite our knowledge of how few pages the image will last...This unreal collection will subvert the normal, entrance, seduce and open your eyes to a labyrinth of chaos.
