I read this one a few weeks ago and I loved the characters in this story because I could see a little bit of myself in each one of them. It is a simple story about a boy named Will Tweedy in a small Georgia town in the early 1900s whose Grandpa remarries the young and very attractive milliner only three weeks after losing his wife.The plot was so easy going and I really felt like I was watching a movie. Burns did a great job with the southern accent - it must have taken her forever to spell each word how it would have been pronounced with a southern accent. The language was so vivid I found myself thinking in a southern drawl.Most of all I loved how this story talks about childhood and adolescent curiosity and expresses some sentiments that people will rarely admit to having. It was hilarious and sad and I thoroughly enjoyed it.
