Secret Vampire was the first book I had read by LJ Smith and with it, began the start of my love affair with her writing. Her characters are enchanting and her stories are vibrant and addicting. The NightWorld series was unlike anything I had ever read and continues to be one of my all time favorite books from childhood.
