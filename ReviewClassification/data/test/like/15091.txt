This was a devastatingly beautiful story. Very hard book to put down and will leave you experiencing a wide arrange of emotions. I did not have the whole it is like Romeo and Juliet as many readers/reviewers mention, as I am not a huge fan of that story (love Shakespeare, but not that plot). Instead it was like a love story with no true happily ever after. There is no way for a happily ever after in this book but trust me, it is acceptable to the reader.Overall, a powerful read that will leave you asking yourself questions about life, death, love, and suffering afterwards. Not a book for the faint of heart.
