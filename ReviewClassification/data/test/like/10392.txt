This is my least favorite McCarthy that I have ever, ever read. And you know what that tells you? Not shit, except that the man canbasicallydo no wrong in my eyes. I can and will nitpick, but just know that I don't really mean it and it's only because I love you, baby.First thing's first: I saw this movie about a zillion times before I read the book, though I wish, I wish, I wish that I hadn't. When an author bases a novel's emotional heft largely on the momentum of its action, suspense, and general thrills!, verily it doth suck when you know exactly where all that bing-bang-boom is headed. I am willing to acknowledge that it is unfair of me to judge the book based on this external factor. However,The Roadwas unaffected by my pre-read film viewing, and so I cast one stone. Okay, soNo Countryis not as excellent asThe Road. Again, not saying much.Second thaaang: Unlike in that one book I just mentioned, the staccato style did occasionally get to me. I like to think of it as a warm-up exercise (since practice makes perfect and all), but still I found it to be excessively clipped and jarring in some places. Here and there, it was basically like this: "Moss needed to piss. He found a wall. He unzipped his Wranglers. He pulled out his penis. Moss urinated. The wall got wet. Moss felt relieved. So long, penis." Still, it's Cormac McCarthy; the bulk of the novel is putrid elegance. Expect no less.Third: McCarthy is a craftmaster at evoking vivid landscapes. Added to his skill at articulating scenic minutia, I was actually (just like Moss and his buddy, Chigurh) traveling by car, train, and foot in Texas as I read, completed, and proceeded to mull over this book. I felt the oppressive heat, witnessed the sprawling golden fields, and raced past the rotting roadside dives as McCarthy tromped through them in text. It is eerie-cool to feel double-whammied by a book like that, and so I think I will make a point of being similarly literal again some time in the near future. I'll try not to take it so far that I'm like some asshole who readsUnder the Tuscan Sunon vacation in Italy right after a breakup, but ya know...something like that. I wonder if astronauts read sci-fi novels in space?Fourth and final point: I much prefer the fiery britches Carla Jean. That woman didn't actuallyquitetake things lying down like a frightened and battered puppy. Her extended scene with Chigurh was quite telling, as was her Bonnie and Clyde-like resistance to Sheriff Bell's interrogation concerning Moss's whereabouts. I don't want to spoil anything, but I will say that despite the script's relative accuracy, there are some surprises yet as far as she, Chigurh,andMoss are concerned (to summarize, the latter has a long scene with a character who didn't make the cut for the screenplay, but who reveals a lot about Moss through her interactions with him). The book still has some stories to tell. It isn't all an echo.Anyway, read this book. Why? It's McCarthy, dude. C'mon.
