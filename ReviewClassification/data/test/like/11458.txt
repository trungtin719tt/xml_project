Thank you Marie Lu for giving us a perfect ending :)I felt this final book to be much more serious and stressful than the other two. There was so much going on between the politics, war, and the relationships. Everything was pretty much life or death and it was really hard to know the right thing to do. This is a crazy intense finale to the series, filled with action, alliances, treachery, and emotion. The characters stayed true to themselves, but matured and developed realistically. In the end, there's just enough heartbreak to make this a true dystopian. However, there is a light in the darkness and that all important idea of hope still remains.
