I loved Wrinkle when i was a kid. In reference to L'Engle's overtly Christian themes, upon rereading, i did not find them overwhelming. Instead i found them more as guild lines to deducing the your own spiritual interpretation, which i did and found it to be very enlightening. I felt the same about A Wind in the Door, and even enjoyed it more so than Wrinkle. A Swiftly Tilting Planet was just as good as the second, I only wish there were more about these characters. I plan on reading Many Waters, even though its about the twins as apposed to the character base i love.
