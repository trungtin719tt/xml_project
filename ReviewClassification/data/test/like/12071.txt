At 24, Veronika decides she has experienced everything she has to experience with her life and the only thing now left for her to do is die and so she decides to take her own life by overdosing on sleeping pills. However, her attempted suicide fails and she ends up waking, after a week in coma, in Villette a local hospital and institution for mental patients where Dr. Igor tells her that her suicide attempt has left her with a very weak heart and she has only a few days left to live so she should rejoice and just wait for her death as it was what she had wanted in the first place. But while waiting for her death, Veronika meets the other 'mental' patients and gets to know their stories and during this time she begins to question her beliefs and ideas about life and what 'living each moment of our life fully' actually means....even if it means going against the norms of what society deems as a proper and correct way of living and existing. According to Paulo Coehlo, 'mad people' are not really mad after all...I haven't read much of Paulo Coehlo's books (after the Alchemist this is the second book) mainly because philosophy is not something I am a huge fan of but this book is quite nice...although I can't say I will go out of my way to read all his books any time soon...
