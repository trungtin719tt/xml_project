I cracked open the cover, saw it was written as a journal and thought, "Ugh, not another story written as a journal." Within three entries, I was looking for a hammer and some nails to board my doors and windows to ban visitors, so I could read it in peace.This is a flawed piece of fiction, filled with too many plot contrivances that don't work, inconsistent flow of the storyline, and an annoying protagonist who is often too ignorant to be believed. But, as soon as Captain Elliot (oh, Captain, my Captain!) steps on to the battlefield, you are willing to forgive both author and protagonist for the errors of their ways.Captain Elliot is one of those rare male characters who falls into a unique category with Rhett Butler and Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy. He is delicious, and he is the reason you can't stop reading. When he wasn't around, I can't say I was incredibly interested in the other parts of the story, but as soon as he'd return, I was ready.I can't think of a single man who would enjoy this read, but, if you are a woman who loves a romantic, adventurous story, then go grab a copy.
