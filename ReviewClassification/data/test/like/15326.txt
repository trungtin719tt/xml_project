The latest in the 'Sookie Stackhouse' series, this book ties up a number of loose ends from the previous novels, and charges ahead from the first page.I need to re-read it before I really form a strong opinion on this one. I absolutely enjoyed it, and it earns a 5/5 rating for sheer fun and fast paced plot, but the author made some decisions that I found personally disappointing, and I felt less involved in this book than I have been with the previous novels. That said, I did read it in one day by staying up late, so maybe tiredness is what kept me from really connecting with the characters. The ending was wonderful, and I was pleased to note that in this book less men are throwing themselves at Sookie, and that her relationships with non-romantic characters developed quite profoundly. The introduction of new characters promises excitement in the future, and I do look forward to more of Sookie's adventures.I'll probably edit this review once I've had the chance to re-read!
