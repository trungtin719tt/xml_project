Emilio Sandoz, a Jesuit priest, has returned from humanity' first mission to contact aliens - the sole survivor. A broken man, both physically mutilated and psychologically tormented, he refuses to speak about his experiences. But rumor spread years before his return, and he has become a pariah. Did he not destroy the integrity of an alien culture, introducing forbidden concepts? Did he not betray all his moral standards, sinking into debauchery and inter-species prostitution? Did he?Flashbacks show us the beginnings of the mission: the discovery of indescribably beautiful song-messages from Alpha Centauri, and how the Church was the first to acquire the financing to send a mission to the stars. We learn of Sandoz' early life - how he grew up a tough kid in the slums, but found a true calling as a priest and a brilliant linguist. We see the formation of the mission and its goals - and nothing indicates how Sandoz, seemingly a good, moral, and truly dedicated man, could have sunk to the depths that it is alleged that he did... slowly, the truth unravels, and horrific truths are revealed.An extremely well-crafted and deservedly multi-award-winning book, with a lot of thought-provoking issues explored.My only issue with the book is that it completely ignores (or expects that the reader knows) the history of the Jesuits. Russell obviously did a lot of research into the order and they are believably and lovingly portrayed: too lovingly. It would seem impossible to tell this story without reference to the actual, historical record of the Jesuits and "first contact" with the cultures of the Americas. (Where they certainly did interfere, and with frequently disastrous, if arguably well-intentioned, results.) But not one character seems to consider the issues of their current dilemma in that context, which seems unlikely, and the ethical questions inherent in "missionary work" are not directly considered. It is clear that Russell expects her readers to be able to infer such questions, but I still feeloverall that the book is too sympathetic to missionaries in general.
