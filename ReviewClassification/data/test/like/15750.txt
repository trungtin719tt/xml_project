Nicholas Easter, juror number 2 and a mysterious woman known as Marlee conspire to manipulate the jury to secure a verdict in a landmark trial involving a widow plaintiff (whose husband died of lung cancer because of cigarette addiction) and a big tobacco company. They have to play with both sides (the plaintiff and the defense) and go up against a cunning jury consultant Rankin Fitch who is an expert in jury manipulations. Fitch works for the defense.The Runaway Jury is an intensely suspenseful legal thriller. I could feel my heart pounding as I read the last pages of the book. I was hooked by Grisham's narration as a child mesmerized by bedtime storytelling. The book tackles a lot of important points about cigarette smoking which make the story more interesting. Perhaps Grisham's novels are like cigarettes with nicotine substances which make them so addictive.
