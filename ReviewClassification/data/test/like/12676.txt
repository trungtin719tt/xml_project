Cryptonomicon by Neal Stephenson, is to techno-intellectuals as Bryant-Denny Stadium is to redneck college football fans: it is a monument.According to Stephenson in this very enjoyable, but lengthy book nerds won the Second World War and are keeping global society free from tyranny nowadays.Weighing in at 1168 pages, this behemoth saddles up to the literary buffet line alongsideAtlas ShruggedandWar and Peace. How does a book this big get published and how does an author achieve that goal much less make it entertaining, endearing and just plain good to read? By being expertly written by a very talented author, who is also funny, making similes and metaphors that frequently made me smile and sometimes even laugh out loud.Neal Stephenson comes across like a geeky Jonathon Franzen, blending erudite sci-fi qualities with meticulously crafted characterizations and rolling all into a cocoon of an intricate plot almost as puzzling as the cryptograms that form the foundation of the story. Comprising two related time lines that slowly blend together, Stephenson held my attention, sometimes making it difficult to put the book down.LikeSnow Crash, Cryptonomicon (with a title that is a nod to Lovecraft) works on multiple levels and establishes parallels between times and generations.Finally, this is an allegory for the information age and brilliantly illustrates that our treasure is where our data can be found.
