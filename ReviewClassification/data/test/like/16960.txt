It is my practice to review a book immediately after reading it, if I can. That way it's fresh in my mind and I'm also writing while I'm still under the influence of the book and my feelings about it. Right now, I am so awed and affected by this book that if I tried to compress its meaning into a few paragraphs, it would just come out as gibberish. So I will tell you instead why it's 5 stars and why it will go onto my favorites list.This novel was written 35 years ago, and is even more relevant today than it would have been then. I laughed a lot at the dialogue and the family situations, then sat back and thought "Wow". I started out highlighting sentences, then had to quit, because there were just too many great lines. I loved everything about a book I wasn't even sure I wanted to read at first. The conclusion silenced my brain for a few minutes, when I realized what a remarkable feat this author had accomplished.5 stars not because it left me with a warm feeling or a sense of having learned something. In fact, it confused me in many places and left me wondering what, in fact, I actually do know. 5 stars because every page had me thinking in new ways, along new paths, more so than any book I can remember in the last few years. More importantly, 5 stars because it changed the way I look at our world. That's what classic literature should do.Thank you, Laura!
