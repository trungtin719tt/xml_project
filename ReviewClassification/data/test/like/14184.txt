This book is definitely the best poetry book I have ever read. As soon as my teacher showed me this book and told me what it was about, I instantly wanted to read the book! Its a story about a girl and a "monster", which is a crystal meth and it is changing this what use to be a perfect girl. The best part of this book is the details on how the girl dealt with her addiction and how drugs can change a person. I learned how fast drugs can change someone. This book was fantastic and I recommend this book to ANYONE who wants a great poetry book!
