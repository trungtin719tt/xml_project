One by one some of my Goodreads friends got bewitch'd by this book.And I could see why.Now, the book took us into an odd world.Like the setting. The magicians drove cars and used laptop and it got me thinking, Was this set in present day London or did Stroud go steampunk in this one? Due to the lack of steam-engines and other steam-based technologies, I reckon the setting was present day London.The magicians in this book didn't have magical power. Their magicking came from djinns, or stronger creatures -- like afrits and marids, or weaker creatures -- like foliots and imps. The magicians knew some spells and summoned these bad boys thru complex rituals.Technically these magicians were calledNigromancersbut Stroud didn't call them that.All members of the government were magicians and they pretty much turned England into a police state.Stroud mentioned Night Police and people seemed to fear them but in the end he didn't write about them.I love all the main characters except the villain, Simon Lovelace. Lovelace wouldn't be entering my Rogue Gallery Hall of Fame because he was so vanilla. His motive was too simple, to become the new Prime Minister because he wanted to seize power. That's it.The characters Nathaniel and his master, Arthur Underwood were a pair of delight. Nathaniel because the kid was an unusual protagonist in fantasy books. He summoned the djinn Bartimaeus and ordered him to steal the Amulet of Samarkand from Lovelace and planted it in Underwood's study.When he was five, Nathaniel's parents gave him away to the government because he seemed to have magicking chops. The government made him an apprentice to Arthur Underwood.Underwood, I had to say he was my second favorite character. I kept seeing him in a different light. When Nathaniel was a kid, he seemed to be powerful and a tad cruel. As Nathaniel grew up, from what he told us, Underwood seemed to be one of the weakest ministers -- no more than a stooge. But as the story went on, Underwood, like all men, was somewhere in between: he wasn't all powerful but he wasn't a doormat either. When push comes to shove, he'd stand up and fight.Didn't like how he became a total pussy near the end, though. Yeeeessh. That was one of the turn-off in this book.Another turn-off was the big climax. The big climax was BIG but it was all pow pow pow with no real action.My favorite character was of course the djinn Bartimaeus, who kept me entertained with his rapier wit and sarcastic remarks. You have to read the book to find out what I'm talking about. As a Connoisseur of All Things Sarcastic, I could tell you that B's sarcasm level was akin to that of Gregory House.
