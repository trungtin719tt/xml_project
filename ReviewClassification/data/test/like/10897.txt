For about a three month period, we follow a twelve year old Jack Sawyer on a journey which will take him across the country, but also to other worlds unknown. Jack Sawyer has had a life unlike most kids his age, and his wisdom, determination, and just all-around kick-a$$ness throughout the entire novel, show even a twelve year old boy shouldn't be underestimated.I think one of the things I liked best aboutThe Talismanwas Jack Sawyer. He's the type of character you can't help but love, not only because of the things I mentioned previously of his character, but, he's so strong, innocent, and I think the type of kid we all wanted to be at that age. He reminds me a lot of Jake from the Dark Tower series, but I find Jack to be so much stronger and I even grew to love his character.The journey itself was also really interesting on its own. Not every journey in a person's life is going to be easy. In fact, it may turn out to be even harder than originally thought. Jack's journey is full of hardship, pain, but the rewards he gained during and at the end of his journey, were worth it. I felt as though, sometimes, as I read, I was going through the same trials as Jack. Every time he suffered, I felt like I suffered, or at least my heart suffered along with him. Jack is such a REAL character, not forced, and written so well.Even though this was a collaboration between King and Straub, I felt this was such a really well-written novel: The writing was superb, but also I felt loose ends were tied, my questions were answered, and I felt as though I went along with Jack on his journey. I feel sometimes all of those things are hard to achieve in novel. But yet again, King (and Straub) shows why he is a master author. The descriptions of scenery, emotion, people, of everything, made me feel as I was apart of these pages myself.The only "problem" I had with this book was the character Wolf. At first, I found him to be annoying...extremely annoying. But, I loved Jack so much, and I wanted to see where this journey would take him, I decided to put up with Wolf. As I read on, I actually grew to like him. I don't think he brings the story down at all, because he endures a lot himself.All in all,The Talismanis so well worth the investment to read. I am looking forward toBlack Houseso I can see where Jack travels to next.
