Mmmm, haven't read Nicholas Sparks's books in a little while.This was pretty good, sure.So there's a bunch of rivalry going on in this tiny city. Sarah-I think that's her name-had just come for a couple months, as a school teacher and meets this kid Jonas. He's kinda falling behind-no not dumb-but was not pushed to doing work and stuff.And it was because his mom had died, so from pity, teachers passed him despite his lack of education.So yes. A parent-teacher conference is needed.And yes. Once again, some romance starts between the two, only Miles-Jonas's father-is feeling a bit weird, thinking that he should not be dating after the love of his life died.Blapahdiblah.Just like all of his other books, they fall in love.But when Miles tries to avenge his wife's death, he goes totally balistics, and seriously breaks practically every law. By arresting his rival.I guess that would be a suffice presumption, only he didn't have any proof.But really the answer is really sketchy and totally unbelievable.I liked that part though, so like yeaa. :]But clue here: The answer is related to his new love, Sarah.I know...Oh. My. Gee.Some love life, huh?
