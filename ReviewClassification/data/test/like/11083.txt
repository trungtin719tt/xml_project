I have just completed my FOURTH read of this book and guess what? Istilllove it! It's like a slice of pizza, mac and cheese, chili and cornbread, cheeseburger and fries... the best comfort food. When you read this book the first time, you see a young, naively superficial, but well-intentioned young woman grieving who travels to Dublin to try and find answers to her sister's bizarre murder. Once there, she meets the mysterious Barrons, owner of Barrons Books and Baubles, a carnal man who isn't what he appears.Layers of the onion are unpeeled, and Mac discovers there is a whole other world full of fae, not Tinker Bell fairies, but monsters. Even the pretty ones are deadly and ruthless and treat humans as animals. Mac isn't going to let them take over the world, and she is going to use her new-found powers, along with Barrons connections and strength to take back the planet!This book starts it all and I'll always love this series. It made me love books more than I thought I could. I am totally biased and unashamed of it when it comes to this series. Mac is bad-ass and Barrons is at the top of my book boyfriend list, tied only with Eric Northman.The THIRD Fever seriesMacHaloGroup Re-read starts November 23, 2017.This will actually be myfourthtime reading, so screw it. I am adding a brand new review space. (I still don't trust GRs new re-read system thing. Plus, who remembers the dates they read a book each time?) I have this edition from picking it up at a thrift store.Original review:Darkfever: FIVE STARS!
