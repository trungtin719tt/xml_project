WOW. I liked this one. (More than I thought I would.) It is historical fiction WWII. It was so close to 5 stars.....I still may change it from 4 to 5. I first read this author'sThe Caine Mutinynot long ago and I really enjoyed the ease of his writing. So I picked this one up and thought the same thing. I loved the writing and that this book was about war AND people. The war strategies, the thoughts, the fear, and the willingness to step up and step in, were well done here. The family drama was also captivating. It ends on a bit of a cliffhanger. So I just bought the second book a few minutes ago and will start that one today.
