Fun! and I think I am part of the intended audience. I am definitely an Anglophile. I enjoy English literature and humor with that touch of the fantastic. I have no issue with a bit of time travel or people and characters moving in and out of literary favorites. I am willing to suspend my disbelief in service of such a good read. This is definitely an alternate reality, a police state of sorts but with this literary difference.This really was a romp! I enjoy the concept of the flexibility of the novels we read, that they can be warped or altered by malevolent forces. I will check out more of this series but I will wait a while. I have a feeling that reading these books too closely together or too frequently would diminish the enjoyment. After all, there can't be too many ways to perform some of these tricks...or can there?
