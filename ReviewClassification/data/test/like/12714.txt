This book has been sitting on my shelf for 20 years. It was purchased at the Bay Ridge branch of the Brooklyn Public Library by my Aunt Peg. The book bears a curious inscription on the upper right-hand corner of one of the blank end pages: 33,000,000 1/27/95. I don't know what that means but she died of cancer not long afterwards so it and the book have acquired a kind of totemic power over my imagination.I understood that Geek Love would be dark because all books about the circus are dark, but not even my reading of Fred Rosen's Lobster Boy: The Bizarre Life and Brutal Death of Grady Stiles Jr., prepared me for Geek Love. I imagined that the darkness of a story of a family of freaks would be leavened by their familial bond. Once I started to read the book I understood the opposite to be true. These characters are shockingly cruel and that cruelty carries over to prose that revels in places many would be repulsed. To tell this story in this way requires a great deal of courage and it's gratifying to see, even though I've come to the novel late, that it's found so many readers.And I can't help but wonder what my aunt, who was no stranger to cruelty herself, meant by giving me this book. Once, while riding as a passenger in her car, I watched as she veered out of the lane to hit a giant puddle and soak the people waiting at the bus stop. That's what reading Geek Love is like: a ride that takes perverse pleasure in the pain of others.
