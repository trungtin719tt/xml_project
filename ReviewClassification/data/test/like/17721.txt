The Awaken is a booked packed with intrigue, questions, mysteries, and the surreal. It was an exciting maze to parse out all of the secrets contained in the pages of this book. There are several layers to this story that start with Sar, who is exiled from earth, to music stars, doctors, CIA agents and more. The story is full of twists and turns that keep you on your toes as you read. I loved the moments that felt almost surreal as the characters struggle to understand what is happening around them. I really enjoyed reading this book from the interesting characters to the action-packed plot. If you love sci-fi, then you should definitely check this book out.
