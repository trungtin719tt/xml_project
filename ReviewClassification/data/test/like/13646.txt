Upon Reread: 5 starsThe first time I read this book, I wasn't used to fantasy, or the kind of complexities that this story and plot tackles. I'm honestly just in awe of the execution of this story. It's a slow start, and it has some jarring moments as far as the pacing goes, but Scott Lynch did something really unique with the story telling of this book and it's just a brilliant story, with brilliant characters, and I can't wait to continue on in the series.----------------------------------------This is a book that I pushed through because you guys were so excited when I said I would give it a try. I considered putting it down several times because there were several stretches where I felt like nothing would happen. But then the whole world would blow up and I was hooked again.So basically, there were thrilling parts where I was on the edge of my seat and freaking out (or wanting to throw up) and my heart was racing. Then, those unbelievably interesting and dramatic and gruesome scenes would be interrupted but long stretches of backstory. And sometimes the backstory was thrilling too! Sometimes it wasn't. And they came up too much for my taste. I mean, some of the backstory scenes were my favorite scenes in the book! But it felt like we were jumping around too much and it kept disrupting the flow for me.That being said, this book was a masterpiece. It was raw and real and the intricacies and rapid turns were above the skill of most novels I've ever read. How one man could come up with all these scams and tricks and amazing life lessons is beyond me. This book deserves all it's hype. I highly recommend.
