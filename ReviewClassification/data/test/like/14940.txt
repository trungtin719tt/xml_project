Dead as a Doornail4 StarsIn the aftermath of the witch war, Sookie Stackhouse only wants to live a quiet life. Unfortunately, this is not to be as someone is using the local shifter population in Bon Temps for target practice and Sookie's brother, Jason, the newest member of the Were-Panther community is the prime suspect. Added to this is the arrival of a menacing vampire from out of town and a struggle for pack leadership amongst the Werewolves. Poor Sookie has her hands full!Dead to the Worldis a hard act to follow, but Harris does an admirable job inDead as a Doornail.Let's start with the plot.Although there are three storylines that develop independently, each demonstrates the more negative aspects of the various supernatural groups, which have, until now, been presented in a generally positive light. The sniper mystery emphasizes the disastrous consequences of shifter behavior while the Alpha contest brings out the worst in the wolves, in general, and in Alcide in particular. Finally, the sinister vampire, Mickey, who has his hooks into Tara reveals the threat posed by rogues who view humans as little more than food.With regard to Sookie's love life, she is, once again, the object of affection for numerous supernatural males. While she is a smart, witty and resourceful heroine, it is not clear why so many of them have the hots for her.Bill has been out of the running as Sookie's love interest for several books and this does not appear to be changing any time soon. At this point, he is more of a stalker than anything else.Eric is as enigmatic as ever and his interactions with Sookie are a highlight as she tries to thwart his determined attempts to discover what really happened between them when he lost his memory.Alcide's true nature is also revealed via the Alpha contest sub-plot. Whereas the sexy Were truly appeared to care for Sookie in previous books, the darker of his nature is revealed as he attempts to use and manipulate Sookie for his own selfish needs.Calvin Norris, the were-panther leader, does not fare much better. It is clear that he wants Sookie as little more than a brood-mare and is not above using Jason as leverage.Sam appears to be the only one who truly cares for Sookie's needs and well-being, but does not appear to be the friends with benefits type.Finally, we are introduced to a new character in the form of John Quinn, a were-tiger of all things, and one can only assume that he wants into Sookie's pants as well.All in all, an entertaining addition to the series and I look forward to the next one.
