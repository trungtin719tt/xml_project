What I found most interesting about Pretties was its thematic use of various forms of bodily mutilation/eating disorders. In a perfect society, where everyone is brain-damaged into peace and transformed into absolutely perfectly beautiful creatures, how do you rebel? By starving yourself, cutting yourself - in a lesser sense, by covering your body in tattoos. (Tattoos as mutilation is a controversial thought, and I'm not sure I know where I stand with it - I mean, are some tattoos okay, but a body full of them not? The social stigma and our association of tattoos with crime, wild people, tramps, etc. has a lot to do with it. I like my tattoo, and Jim's three tattoos, and yet I really don't want either of us to get any more. It's kind of weird.) But these teenage boys and girls - they look perfect, they've been surgically transformed into the universal pinnacle of beauty, and they're still starving or mutilating themselves in order to "wake up," to "feel it." It's a very dark aspect of this series, one I'd like to see addressed in further detail, if possible.I'm very excited to read the last installment in the series, Specials. I'm just waiting for it to come out in paperback so I can complete my set.
