I loved reading this book. I read it as a school girl and was awe struck. I lived in Alabama myself so I knew of her home and have visited it several times over the years. There was something wonderful about seeing from her own words how she had not only survived but thrived.She had such an indomitable spirit that shone through. She was my hero when I was a child and she has not lessened the impact she had on me even today.I have just re-read this book and I gained even more insight into her beautiful life. I had forgotten that she was able to read in English, German, French and Latin. She met people like Alexander Graham Bell and began friendships that she carried all through her life. Her desire to learn and witness everything available to her was flawless. She attended plays and fairs and every event while having Anne sign into her hand a vivid description of her surroundings. She could describe these events in detail later in her life with such elegance that I could visualize it myself from her words.She worked tirelessly on learning to speak and her greatest pain came from knowing that she was unable to communicate in a manner that everyone could understand. She and Anne Sullivan worked on correcting her pronunciation throughout her life with that one goal in mind.Anyone that reads this will come out ahead realizing how amazing she truly was. With all her struggles she just pushed and pushed to make her life an amazing never ending adventure. Such an inspirational book, it is not to be overlooked.
