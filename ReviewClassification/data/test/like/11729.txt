This is really sort of three novels in one: Predators, Moth Love, and Old Chestnuts. The book alternates among the three stories, which take place within a few miles of each other. The stories do turn out to be related in the end, but each reads like a separate story. I liked the Moth Love thread the best out of the three.The stories themselves rated about 3 to 3.5 stars for me, but I'm bumping it up to four stars overall because of the author's knowledge and beautiful writing about the natural world. Yes, I'm a nature freak. She writes about some species and aspects of nature I'm not familiar with because I've never been to that part of the country.There's some great humor included in the book as well, and some very amusing dialogue. I guess my greatest criticism would be with the disjointed nature of the three-in-one approach.I'd have to say I prefer the story and characters in The Bean Trees/Pigs in Heaven twosome.
