Ahhhh!This was exactly what I needed . . . the long soak in a hot tub, the breath of fresh air, the perfect antidote to the hatred and venom spewed by the racist, rabid yam currently running for President. Yes, after a week of watching a 70-year-old toddler throw daily tantrums, it was so refreshing to pick up this book and escape to a world where you could stumble upon a stranger's house and be invited in for tea.This volume concentrates on Anne's two years spent teaching. There are good days and bad days as she attempts to mold the young minds of Avonlea.Newly orphaned twins - the lifeless Dora and the way-too-lively Davy - come to live with lifelong spinster Marilla, prompting Mrs. Rachel Lynde to quip,"You're never safe from being surprised till you're dead."A local kook successfully predicts a wicked storm, and the Village Improvement Society, a group spearheaded by Anne and Diana to spruce up Avonlea, is born.Love and laughs abound, and yes, it's sappy as hell, but as I said,exactly what I needed.I have a feeling I'm going to be rereading the rest of this series before November rolls around. It's so nice to know that when I wake with a 3 AM panic attack, convinced that Trump has already won and life as we know it is over, that Anne's simple, and simply beautiful, world will be waiting for me.
