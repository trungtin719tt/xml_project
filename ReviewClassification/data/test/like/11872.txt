It was a great movie &amp; a better book. Definitely a tear jerker. The love illustrated is the finest kind, Shakesperian in its depth &amp; tragedy. A wonderful stand alone, but the sequel,Oliver's Storyis almost as good. Both are a must read - once. I doubt you'll forget them after one read &amp; they're too heart wrenching to re-read.
