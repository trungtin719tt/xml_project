It feels as if my life truly started when I read this book. There are no words for it. It shaped who I am today. It's beautiful, amazing, awe-inspiring, and so much more. I used to read this at night before I went to bed to give myself happy dreams.I dreamed about the courage and honor and bravery and love that venerates through each and every word of the book. I dreamed that I could have half of the bravery of the characters. It is a beautiful, amazing book.I wrote this (^) four years ago. Honestly, it doesn't appeal to me much at all anymore. But i appreciate it for what it gave me.
