3 APR 2016 - Love, Love, Love this book. As a little girl, I carried this book everywhere. I did not know at that time that Ferdinand was all about seizing his day and enjoying it in the way most suitable to himself. Such a smart bull!As I re-read a newly purchased copy yesterday, I thought of this lovely poem:Gather Ye Rosebuds While Ye May, by John William Waterhouse (Source: Wikipedia)"To the Virgins, to Make Much of Time" is a poem written by English Cavalier poet Robert Herrick in the 17th century. The poem is in the genre of carpe diem, Latin for seize the day. It goes as follows:Gather ye rosebuds while ye may,Old Time is still a-flying;And this same flower that smiles todayTo-morrow will be dying.The glorious lamp of heaven, the sun,The higher he's a-getting,The sooner will his race be run,And nearer he's to setting.That age is best which is the first,When youth and blood are warmer;But being spent, the worse, and worstThen be not coy, but use your time,And, while ye may, go marry:For having lost but once your prime,You may forever tarry.Carpe Diem, Ferdinand! You have inspired this not-so-young woman to live her life in this moment. No looking back to the past which cannot be undone nor looking ahead to the future which has not occured. Carpe Diem.
