Well I loved this book the most. Juliette and Warner FINALLY get together. There are a lot of revelations between them. Warner lets down his guard in a lot of areas.The Omega's have been wiped out . . . well most of them.There is way too much drama with Adam going off his rocker. I think it was all written out very clearly why there was supposedly love between Adam and Juliette. It wasn't really love, but you have to read the book to find out! Ha!Kenji is his same funny self. Although, he did have a little bit of a break down because we can't always keep everyone up and laughing. I'm glad him and Juliette are best friends, we all need someone like that. But some of the funny things he says and I agree with him on the Bruce Lee matter!Everyone was looking at me. "What do you think?" I ask."Your suite looks just like mine." Kenji frowns. "I'm supposed to be the one with the black suit. Why can't you have a pink suit? Or a yellow suit-""Because we're not the freaking Power Rangers," Winston says, rolling his eyes."What the hell is a Power Ranger?" Kenji shoots back."Are you out of your goddamn mind? You think we can take on two hundred soldiers? I know I am an extremely attractive man, J, but I am not Bruce Lee.""Who's Bruce Lee?""Who's Bruce Lee?" Kenji asks, horrified. "Oh my God. We can't even be friends anymore.""Why? Was he a friend of yours?""You know what," he says, "just stop. Just--I can't even talk to you right now."Juliette does master the control of her powers. A bunch of them get together with her and Warner to defeat Anderson. It was too cool the things that Juliette does. And even though there isn't a lot of action in the book, the parts that were, I loved! And that's good enough for me :-)Now, Juliette is in control and they will have to fight many wars. But with her friends and Warner by her side, anything is possible.Fin . .MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List
