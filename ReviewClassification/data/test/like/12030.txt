"She did not know that the wolfwas a wicked sort of animal,and she was not afraid of him."She is sassy and fiesty.He is dark, mysterious, and ADORABLE!What more do you need people?!. . . Did i mention she carries a gun around?? Yeah, you don't mess with that one. ;)"Wait until morning," he said."The world wont be safe tonight."Still cant find a perfect Wolf! This will do for now. Who do you guys picture as Wolf?Now that i have read all four books, i can say this without a doubt Scarlet and Wolf are indeed my favorite of them all! I am very ashamed to say after reading Cinder i wanted to skip this one and jump onto Cress. It might have something to do with Rapunzel being my favorite fairytale, or me being uncomfortable with the idea of welcoming a new main character, especially since i know almost nothing about the Red Ridding Hood. I see them more as Beauty and the Beast. I JUST LOVE THESE TWO SO FREAKING MUCH!Holland Roden would make a perfect Scarlet.I have read this book 3 times already, it's about time I move onto the audiobook. Just can't get enough. =D
