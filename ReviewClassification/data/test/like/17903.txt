Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden is a wizard. He is also a detective, and he's best at what he does. When a suspicious magic related murder occurred, the Chicago P.D. comes to him for answers. Aside from that though, he also has other personal cases at hand.My very first Urban Fantasy novel. I've been wanting to read this for months now, and I'm glad that I finally did. Crime/Detective-Fantasy is something new to me, but not anymore. Two of my favorite genres combined, and executed wonderfully. I heard ravishing remarks regarding this series, and I now understand all the hype. This is not a perfect novel, it had a few flaws here and there, but it was enjoyable overall.Harry Dresden reminded me of a lot of characters that I love. Tony Stark, Sherlock Holmes, and Dr. House to name a few. He was not created as a perfect character, and that is the right way to do it. Despite being a wizard, he still had flaws. Aside from him reminding me of some favorites, the novel itself felt like it was a crossover of NCIS and a superhero TV show. His relationship with Murphy was really similar to those of the crime genre. The woman hates him yet ends up giving him what he wants, and ends up arresting/hating him in the end. Typical crime stuff that I really enjoy.I was a wizard. Wizards control their power. They don't let it control them. And wizards don't use magic to kill people. They use it to discover, to protect, to mend, to help. Not to destroy.I was not expecting that at all. I've watched quite a few shows and movies regarding wizards, and they're all badass crazy. Dresden was just crazy, but he was good. He obeyed thefirst lawthing that magic shouldn't be used to kill. I heard about that rule already somewhere, but I remember main characters breaking that rule and getting away with it. I was expecting the same form Dresden, but didn't get what I wanted. I was expecting a lot of magic spurting out of his staff and all, but the magic present in the novel was mellow. There were a lot of action in the novel, but I wanted it to be more badass than it was. This novel seemed to follow realistic ideas, despite it being a fantasy novel. It's not a huge problem for me, but I am hoping for more action in the next ones. And more magic.Little did I know that wizards areweakerthan witches. Weaker in a sense that they follow the rules more, so they use less magic. If you use less magic and battle with someone who uses a shit load of magic, then odds are you'll lose. Or die. I still like Dresden a lot though.The plot itself was not bad. Despite this being ahugeseries, this novel still ended with closure. I hate forced cliffhangers, and this one didn't have that. There is a note somewhere on goodreads stating that each novel from the series is sort of a standalone, but each one heavily relies from the latter. I like those kinds of series, because sometimes you need a break from it. Especially those never ending ones. I'm quite excited of what the author has in stored for the next books.4.3/5 stars. My very first Urban-fantasy novel, and it will not be my last. I'm starting to enjoy this genre. Recommendations will be greatly appreciated!
