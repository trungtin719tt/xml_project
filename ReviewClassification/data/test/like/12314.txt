I read this ages ago. But at the time I was absolutely entranced by this novel. It has knights and rogues, romance and adventure, Templars (they are evil here) and Robin Hood crew. Yes, the plot is a bit naive and characters are black &amp; white. But this is a charming novel with lots of heart to it. If you are 12 - beg, borrow or steal yourself a copy (but try begging and borrowing first).
