It was kind of weird reading this book. Perhaps my memory is a little skewed but in most Sookie books there's always a lot going on and Sookie is hardly home. However in this book it was interesting in that Sookie was in Bon Temps the whole book. She went to work and tended the garden all while the supernatural stuff came to her. It felt a bit slow to me but Eric was in it a lot and that's more than enough to keep me happy. I'm certainly curious as to hearing his explanation for him being MIA in a certain point and waiting for the next book to come out will drive me crazy. Grrr.
