OMG this book drove me CRAZY!!! But I loved it...lolLet's see...where do I start?I was frustrated with all the characters for different things...Melanie...for burning Emily's diary, which may have helped with the trial, and also maybe she should have told the police about the watch. Also her lack of communication with her husband Michael, and also burning Emily's photos.Michael...for turning to Gus....did not like where I thought that was going to go....thank God it didnt.Gus....for turning to Michael...see above. Also, you didnt hear much about her daughter Kate...she pretty much alienated her.James...upset he wasnt visiting Chris or sharing his emotions.Emily...I felt she was very selfish. I feel like she was teasing Chris, and leading him to think she loved him the same way he loved her. She loved him like a brother, but kept going along with doing more with him. She pretty much ruined his life, and was very selfish for wanting him to help her commit suicide, and not telling him she was pregnant.!!!???? (DID NOT LIKE EMILY)Chris...about two thirds thru the book is when I started feeling bad for him....his emotions, life, everything, was being played and toyed with by Emily.I dont fully understand how he could have gone through with helping her commit suicide, and not tell someone...either her parents or his? I wonder if he did, if things would have ended up okay, or if she would have went ahead and done it alone?When I first started I thought it was about a suicide PACT...but really, it was a different PACT alltogether.I think Emily pressed Chris' finger and shot herself. She got the strength to do it because he was there with her. I don't think he would have done it otherwise. Neither one could do it by themselves.Another Picoult book that has me whirling, and will need a couple of days before picking up another book. Definately a page turner.
