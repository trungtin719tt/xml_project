There is no real magic in Mary Poppins' carpet bag or in her medicine, actually!It is all about her modern pedagogy, I just realised. Have you ever tried to create a lesson out of nothing? (And, like Travers, I really mean no-thing-ness!) You start with kids claiming there is absolutely NO-THING INTERESTING in that carpet bag of yours, your subject. What can you do but shake it and turn it and show those kids that just because they don't see anything that doesn't mean it doesn't contain plenty of quite necessary things, and some nice luxury articles as well?The trick is to make them envious of the things you discover in your carpet bag, and they will want one of their own.Same goes for the medicine. Rum punch might be a hard sell nowadays, but surely there are medicines that taste like Coke and contain all the nutrients of a healthy lunch? If you have never sat through a meal with toddlers telling them that cucumbers are candy, you may have none of the Poppins magic - yet. But I am sure the necessity of combining kids and vitamins will catch up with you before the wind changes. Which brings me to the walk in the park. Of course we all jump right into pictures! How else would we continue moving when we have no entertainment but our legs and thoughts? There is an inner movie for each moment spent walking, I believe.So yes, dear Mary! You are a modern pedagogue if ever there was one. We all need to invent fairytales for ourselves and our kids, to find the inner magic elements that carpet bags and medicine bottles contain - the magic of learning through storytelling.Firm, with a smile, that's Mary Poppins!
