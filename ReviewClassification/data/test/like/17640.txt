I liked this book for the story of a girl surviving on her own and her learning experiences but I thought the sex was a bit over the top. I guess I just wasn't expecting that much sex and that much detail. I mean, I really don't need to know that Ayla was turned on by watching horses mate or that Jondalar's "woman maker" was too large for most females. I was under the impression that this series of books was for the "young adult" audience, mostly because I knew lots of people who read The Clan of the Cave Bear for a class in high school. I probably would have enjoyed the sex bits a lot more in high school but now at age 30 they just kind of creeped me out. I would be creeped out knowing my high schooler was reading this (however I wouldn't stop him, I'm all for reading whatever you want). I am still giving this book 4 stars though because I thoroughly enjoyed Ayla's relationships with Whinney and Baby.
