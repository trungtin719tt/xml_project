My 2018 Review ooh 4.5 starsSo as part of my Hercule Poirot challenge, courtesy of Jessica in "Reading the Detectives", I decided to read this book for the 2nd time in 13 months (why when I have so many books I want to read I don't know, but I did). Was I disappointed, oh no, if anything I'm seriously thinking of upping it to 5 stars. Despite a gap of only 13 months , I got so much from this re-read. In fact I've obviously read so much in that intervening time, that it took me over 3/4 of the book to guess who had done it.I'm not going into any spoiler details but it is superbly written with so many red herrings and false clues. So so well done. Maybe a third time, but give me a few years.My 2017 Review 4 starsWhere to start, well I saw a few other people wanted to read this as a Buddy read, so whilst on a Miss Marple kick (challenge) I thought why not. I cannot remember ever having read this or even seeing it as a TV adaptation and did not guess the ending until right at the very end.The central characters of Dr Sheppard and his sister Caroline are excellent, with the Dr playing the Hastings role for Poirot.I think the story is well constructed with many twists and turns, and overall generally good (i've given it 4 stars), I was just a little sad at the end. Read it and find out.
