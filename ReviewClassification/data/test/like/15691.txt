First Read February 2008: This book is probably in my top 10. I love this book because the main character feels like a real person. The situations she faces and the way she reacts to the situations are very real-life. It's very easy to relate emotionally to this book, and it is an emotional roller coaster. You'll be happy, sad, mad, glad, angry, frusterated, laughing, and crying right along with the characters. Oh and you won't be able to put this book down.Reread May 2014: I have reread this book 4 or 5 times since I first read it in 2008. It's one of those books that has stayed with me, and inspired me. I love Sarah, the main character. I think that she embodies everything a woman should be. I love her imperfections and her strengths. I love that she has a strong sense or morality, even when things aren't popular with the time period she lives in. (Like having an Indian over for dinner, or treating her Mexican neighbors like family.) I love her insights on motherhood, child rearing, and education. And I love how her character develops and grows. This book makes me laugh, and cry; every time I read it.
