Just arrived from USA through BM.Since I absolutely lovedUnbroken, I decided to read LH's famous book after have watched the movie based on this book a long time ago.The main characters, Charles Howard, Red Pollard and Tom Smith are entwined into Seabiscuit's career and the book shows how his life changed their own lives forever.Even if it's a non-fiction book, Hillenbrand knows how to give a true fictional character to the narrative itself, putting her own heart on it.I am looking forward for her third book which I hope will come pretty soon.
