Huge, compelling read. Though I may hesitate to call the book "enlightening", I'd probably feel comfortable describing it as "broadening", particularly regarding the range of viewpoints on various players' roles and motives in the war. It contains plenteous opinions about martial tactics (particularly Germany's) and the effects of politics (particularly the US's) on the outcomes in WWII. Opinions or not, it was refreshing to see unconventional views stated so thoroughly and convincingly. I was also somewhat shocked to learn how virulently anti-war the US populace was at the time.[Minor spoiler alert: When the main character, Pug Henry, a Navy Captain having already spent one-on-one time with (in order) Hitler, Roosevelt, Mussolini and Churchill, obtains a private audience with Stalin, the needle on my disbelief suspension meter finally snapped clean off. Fortunately, it didn't detract from the saga as a whole.]All-in-all, I enjoyed the book immensely and, through it, came by a number of new perspectives regarding the conduct of the war and it's key operatives. It's a fascinating study of the personalities involved and the effects for which each of them were, arguably, responsible. Wouk has an amazing grasp of history and research, combined with a marvelous ability to keep a tale compelling through some 250,000+ words via the use of a seemingly endless array of story-telling devices. There's no deus ex machina and there's plenty of unfinished business in the end - all as it should be. I enjoyed it enough to have already begun the follow-up novel,War &amp; Remembranceand I'll soon enough read his Pulitzer winner,The Caine Mutiny.Finally, and perhaps most importantly, I found it particularly enlightening, in light of the current state of American and European realpolitik, to learn how Roosevelt was viewed by many at the time vs. how he's generally viewed today. A fascinating contrast, and particularly pertinent at this moment in history.
