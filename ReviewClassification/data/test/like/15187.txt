I was 18 when I read This Lullaby, and it was the first Sarah Dessen novel that I had read. To this day, it is still my favorite book by Dessen.The main character Remy is very relatable to many teenage girls, and even to young women who remember being the way Remy is when they were in high school. Remy's family and friends are a very loveable group of characters and their development is flawless.There are little twists here and there that carry the book toward the end. It does start off a little slow, but Dessen has a way with words and really knows how to get into the minds of young women and tell their stories with honesty and innocence.
