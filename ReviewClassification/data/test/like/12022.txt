From the Mixed-up Files ofMrs. Basil E. FrankweilerBy E.L. KonigsburgThis is a delightful story for children of all ages. I'm wondering why I never discovered this book when I was a kid?Claudia is planning to run away. She wants a different life, than that of the oldest child, with so many responsibilities. Her brother Jamie doesn't know it yet, but she has chosen him to be her companion. One reason she has chosen Jamie, is because he is good with money. Claudia usually spends her money on hot fudge sundaes, but Jamie has saved over twenty dollars.Claudia plans for them to take a train to New York City, and stay in the Metropolitan Museum of Fine Arts. Hiding out, being hungry most of the time, and walking in order to save money, the two children experience the adventure of a lifetime. They also get involved in the mystery of an angel statue, which was sold to the museum by Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler. Could the angel statue be a real Michelangelo? Only Mrs. Frankweiler knows for sure.Will Claudia and Jamie get caught in the museum? Will they run out of money, and need to go home, before solving the mystery? Does their family really miss them? Can they find Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler? Will she be willing to help them, if they do find her?I recently spent the night in The Museum of Ancient History, in Draper Utah, with two of my granddaughters. They call it Dino-snores. We slept right under the tail of a huge dinosaur. There is definitely something intriguing about sleeping in a museum, especially when the lights go out.Jill Ammon VanderwoodAuthor: Through the RugThrough The Rug 2: Follow That Dog (Through the Rug)Stowaway: The San Francisco Adventures of Sara, the Pineapple Cat
