Two weeks ago I didn't know I was having appendicitis. I thought I was dying. Seriously, as in calling my family from where I lay curled up on the floor. I can walk a few blocks now, so that's great. Go grandma! As for being able to concentrate on things, it pretty much consists of watching Monk reruns, and reading The Book of Mormon before I go to sleep.I've never had surgery before, and I have a lot more understanding for those who can't take care of themselves. It's like living in a cage, only your body is the cage.I wrote this part several months ago: It is hard for me to know which bookshelf to put this on, because I've read it many times, and I'm currently reading it. Like the Bible, I turn to it all the time. It has an honored place on my bedside table so I can read from it morning and night. It is referred to as a "second testament of Christ".For anyone who thinks that Mormon's are not Christian people, it might be helpful to read this book before coming to that conclusion ;o) Like all books of scripture, such as the Quran or the Dhamapada, it is uplifting, it brings peace and it helps me have a sense of my place in the universe. There is no greater peace in my life than to know that I am loved and known by God.
