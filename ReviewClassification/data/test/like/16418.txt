Everything you need to know about "The Ocean at the End of the Lane" is right there in the title. The Ocean it alludes to is deep (fathom-deep as the true meanings of family &amp; love &amp; death); blue (icy like the Coraline's motherspider antagonist-- the demonic Nanny McPhee in the middle of the story; cold like the rigidity of death, the panic of succumbing to childhood traumas); vast (like the leitmotifs spread out in elegant splendor along the narrative, tokens of the writer's impressive &amp; grand imagination), with suds atop (the frivolity and juxtaposition of childhood elements with the supernatural positively effervesce) but much darker &amp; stranger as the composites of the undertow sometimes reach upward, showing us the complex nature of human souls.It is a true achievement.
