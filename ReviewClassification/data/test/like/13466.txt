This is not just a book, it's an adventure. You can tell that Davidson did not rush this book. The writing is detailed and vivid but not overdone. The characters jump off the page when you're reading this book, its like you're right there with them. It's amazing, it's a great read, it's an experience.This book should not be underestimated, there are stories within stories and meanings within meanings and real depth. The writing is excellent. This book will move you emotionally and not always for the better. I will never be able to hear about a burn victim again without cringing and thinking back to this book. I will never get the scene of the Archangel Michael in hell out of my head. It was beautifully done!!I was a little disappointed with the ending being anti-climatic but I'm hoping that's because there will be a sequel.So here I am having to go on to another book, which always stinks after finding a great book, because many subsequent books pale in comparison. I was used to mundane writing and it made me happy but now I've tasted greatness and everything else doesn't make the grade. Its like being a kid and thinking that Hershey's chocolate is great, until you grow up and taste real chocolate and know that you've been eating crap all those years. Oh well.....
