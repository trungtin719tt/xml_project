A powerhouse!I can't very well say I have become a fan of Dennis Lehane because, after all, this is the first of his work that I have read, but I will certainly be reading more of his work ( I already have purchased 'Shutter Island')and if it is anything like Mystic River, then yeah, count me in as a huge Lehane fan.This book was about as close to perfect as you can get. The story drew me in; I felt like I was there, mingling with the locals, I could feel the atmosphere of the city and I could feel the emotions and the lives of the characters in the story. This was, edge of your seat, suspenseful, gritty, sad, powerful...so many layers. This book was just under 600 pages and there was not a single occasion where I became bored or felt the temptation to skim. (Yeah, ya'll know what I'm talking about)A king in his streets internally being crucified on his own sword called Karma, a successful detective trying not to drown in his lost faith in humanity, and the boy...the boy who climbed in the back seat of a car that smelled like apples.This one is going on my favorites shelf and I highly recommend it to all.
