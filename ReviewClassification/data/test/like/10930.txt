'Once upon a time there was a boy who loved a girl, and her laughter was a question he wanted to spend his whole life answering.'This might be one of the most beautiful sentences in the arsenal of the english language. Actually, I came upon this sentence in one of those click baitonline articles entitled '50 Of The Most Beautiful Sentences In Literature.'Not a dignified source, I admit. Nevertheless the list was composed of greats such as Solzhenitsyn, Plath, Maugham, Eliot, Garcia Marquez, Bronte, to lend it some small sort of credence. And so, recognizing about ninety percent of the writers, it was a pleasant surprise to see the sentence above resonate with me and not know the author. I looked up the book. Saw the great reviews, a lot of five stars from reviewers I trust. Got the book, read it, loved it.If I could describe this novel using one word, it would be 'tender.' It is actually a rare occurrence for me to come across a book and feel emotion from the prose. This was one of those rare moments that I felt the writing get to me. It supplemented a nostalgic yet hopeful story engulfing it in gorgeous prose that would move even the most stoic of readers. I have to admit that lately I have been having a hard time connecting to the voices of the books I read, but this proved unbearable even for all my lethargy.I'm not going to talk much about plot.

It transcends romance and goes to where other books about love, those that call it romance, fail. Humanity. It believes that at our very core, we are beings that are capable of giving parts and wholes of ourselves to people, to romantic partners, to parents, to sons and daughters, to siblings, to family, to friends, to strangers, to those who need us. I want to believe that as well.
