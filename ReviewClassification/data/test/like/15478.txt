Hmmmmm.....probably one of the most sobering books I have ever read....plausible, poignant, post accidental apocalyptic....it left me mad at Man; mad at His stupidity; mad at His ridiculous striving after world dominance, instead of striving after world harmony.Nevil Shute's sharply perceptive understanding of Human emotions is pure genius (I would have written 'mastery' there but I understand in some lands that word can be considered offensive....in England, it is not....however, I have declined to use it....well, sort of)!A formidable read, an austere warning: even though the writing of the book is over fifty years old, it still rings out with the same uncompromising message, that 'Man dominates Man to his injury'.Haunting, compelling, undeniably persuasive and definitely leaves you with 'fallout' for days after you have finished reading it.
