All of Ms. Hamilton's books have erotic undertones, but this is toward the beginning of the series, before those undertones turned into overtones, sidewaystones, diagonaltones, and all those other tones that we can't discuss in polite society. At this point and through book six or seven, you can still call them action novels, rather than "action" novels, at which point you're just turning the pages thinking MY GOD, WHAT A HORNBALL THIS WOMAN IS.Anyway, if you like the supernatural and action heroines (read 'babes with guns'), and don't mind a few (read 'dozens of') bloody scenes, there's something about a French vampire, a lesbian werewolf, and a 5'3" heroine that I found captivating. Give it a try if you're in the mood.
