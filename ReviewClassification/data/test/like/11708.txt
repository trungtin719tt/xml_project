Lots of different subplots that eventually intertwine, includes a love story too. She writes very lyrically, you'll want to savor this one. Nature / animal lovers will appreciate this one too. Something for everyone, this one is probably in my all time top 10 or 15 list.2nd reading: This is not a book to read but a book tofeel. It's a book you feel the truth and the rightness of, down deep in your gut.
