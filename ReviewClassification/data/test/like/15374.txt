In 1964 was publishedA Moveable Feast. A fictionalized biography that tells the life of Ernest Hemingway in the Paris of the twenties.In the book the happiness of someone who has had the fortune of having lived in that city is perceived. The joy of a foreign correspondent for being immersed in a continuous party. It was very common for the Americans of the time to visit the French capital, the ideal place for a young man who wanted to write something good. Writers such asEzra Pound,James Joyce,Ford Madox FordorEvan Shipmanparade through the book.There is a second group of authors who do not get out very well, this is the case ofF. Scott FitzgeraldandGertrude Stein. Something strange, because both tried to help him in his beginnings. To Fitzgerald,Ernest Hemingwaydescribes him as a hypochondriac drunk under the influence of his wife Zelda, a woman jealous of her husband's talent and success. With Gertrude Stein is more moderate, they were very good friends. Ernest used to visit the writer's house to ask for advice on the things he was writing and she gave him stylistic advice. The real cause of the friction was the jealousy of Stein's lover,Alice B. Toklas, jealous of the friendship with Hemingway.Unfortunately this work was written by a sick man, immersed in a decline that memories ended up finishing. Although the images of Paris are evocative, nostalgia can be glimpsed in many of its pages. A Hemingway flogged by his madness tried to relive past times, those days of economic hardship, when he lived above a ballroom with his wife Hadley and his son, walks on the banks of the Seine or write in the cafes. It was the life of a teenage artist, with monetary problems, but immersed in innocence; everything was easier. Paris baptized the"beat generation".Lisbon Book-Fair 2015.
