I was truly enjoyingThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy(you can read my reviewhere) when my sister gave me The Restaurant at the End of the Universe as a birthday present. Then I faced the weirdest conundrum (quitead hocfor the weirdest book I've erver read): I didn't wanted the book to be over and at the same time I just wanted to finish the book so I could start reading the sequel. Well, the unavoidable happened, and the only reason I didn't undergo an OMG-I-can't-believe-this-is-over crisis was that I started readingThe Restaurant at the End of the Universeas soon I as was done with the first book.There was still a crisis I didn't know if I could avoid, and that was the What-the-hell-this-is-not-as-good-as-it-was-supposed-to-be crisis. Fortunately, that crisis never came. This book is as good as its predecessor. I have no idea of what happened in the first half and don't know how to feel about that, then I remembered that I have no idea of what happened in the entire first book either so I got over it. To be honest, for moments I felt the first half was somehow slow, yet the humor and the randomness are great. I even believe this one is funnier, or maybe it's just me kind of starting to understand. Idk.I cannot say I was disappointed. Now I just want to start readingLife, the Universe and Everythingas soon as it arrives.
