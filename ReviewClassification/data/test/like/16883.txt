4.5 stars. My favourite Sarah Dessen book so far! Before I read this book I was unsure about whether I would like it or not. The plot didn't sound very good or appealing but honestly this book was so so good. I loved it.The best things about this book were the characters and the way the characters interacted with each other. There are so many different relationship dynamics in this book and I loved every single relationship. I liked all of the characters but I absolutely adored Jamie. He was such a sweetheart and I just thought he was so so lovely. The things he did for Cora made me love him even more. I loved Ruby's character development. She completely changed because she gradually opened herself up to new experiences and new people. It was a slow process where Ruby assessed situations and then after some time, her negative thinking changed to positive thinking. It was a very inspirational change.This book actually made me quite emotional in some parts which surprised me. It was just so heartwarming and it was such a lovely story. I absolutely loved how the relationship between Ruby and her sister, Cora took the front seat while the romance was a smaller subplot.Sarah Dessen's writing is awesome as per usual. She puts in the perfect amount of descriptions and her language is simple yet it is profound at times. The dialogue between her characters is really good (like always) and she writes a very realistic teenage girl.I really do love this book but there was something missing (I don't know what) and so I give it 4.5 stars, not 5. I would definitely recommend this and I will definitely be reading more of Sarah Dessen's books.
