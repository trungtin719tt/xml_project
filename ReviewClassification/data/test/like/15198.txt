Probably my favorite Dessen novel. Remy is cynical about love, but she's looking forward to heading off to Stanford with no boyfriend attached. There's just one problem: Remy's latest guy, Dexter, isn't buying into her plan. Not only is he a violation of her "no musicians" rule, he's also intent on sticking around.I like teen novels that don't focus on a central romance at the expense of everything else. Remy has friends and family, and they're as much a part of the story as Dexter is.In many ways this is a conventional teen story, but it's one that's done really, really well.
