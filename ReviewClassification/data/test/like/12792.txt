This is great book!A BOOK FOR EVERYBODYVery quick to read so if you are interested on it.You'll find out that you'd read it in no time.Also, it helps that it's a page turner, since the story has many elements to keep you hooked to it.I hate to classify books for some specific age, since I think that books shouldn't have any age or genre.Books should be read by men or women at any age and they should be as good as effective.However, one can't deny that the author made this story thinking in kids and/or early teenagers, but not matter that, I think that readers of any age can enjoy this story with the same impact and purpose.As C.S. Lewis said (and I am quoting not necessarily with the exact words) "that any children's story that it can't be enjoy by adults, it's a bad children's story".NOT SO SIMPLE AS GOOD OR BADFor readers who are looking for stories where there aren't good people or bad people but just people, this is your book.This story will provoke you many moods and states, you will smile at some moment, you will hate at other, you will cry in yet another.And all that it's okay.I think that this book should be to be read at some moment in your lives.Please, don't let that those labels of "children", etc... in the genres of the book keep you away of the book, not matter how young or how old you are.If you want to read this book, please do, you won't regret it.It's about something important. About something needed to be read.
