"What would Jesus NOT do?"A sex addict who has fake-choked in so many restaurants that he has to start browsing the phone book for new material. A delusional mother, delusional doctor, delusional friends in a delusional life. There are so many great one liners throughout this book that if I highlighted, there would be more yellow than white within these covers.Chuck Palahniuk has a unique way of taking down the curtains we erect in our own minds to escape the cruel, stinking, insane realities of our everyday lives. I can see why some people can't stand reading his work...because They probably can't handle having that curtain ripped down.I have found his work to be humorous, painfully realistic, thought provoking, grotesque, and what we all want as readers...down right entertaining.So choke on that, beeotches!
