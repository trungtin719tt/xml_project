Blind Assassinstarted out fairly slowly for me. I'd picked it up at the same time asTime Traveler's Wifeand TTW won out for which book hooked me faster. Part of the slowness is due to the narrative devices used to tell the story. Some of the story is told from a first-person viewpoint with the narrator talking about her present situation and slipping back into the past. Some pieces of "fact" are told through newspaper clippings and some of the story is excerpted from a "published" novel by the titleThe Blind Assassin, a novel which purports to tell the romance between a science fiction writer and a high-society gal. Woven throughout their encounters is the SF story of the blind assassin. Quite convoluted, but worth the effort in the end.It's been a long time since I've read Margaret Atwood. In college, she was my favorite author and I read everything she'd written to that point. As a writer, I'd like to go back and reread some of her earlier pieces to see how her style has changed. My sense is that she keeps getting better and better. TBA is so layered and finely paced that it held my attention without keeping me on the edge of my seat. The voice of Iris, who narrates much of the story, is so distinct and I loved the language she uses in describing her current life and how she sees the world -- I especially appreciated how her current views contrast with her lack of insight as a young woman. Even better are Iris's compelling memories of her sister Laura and Reenie, her family's housekeeper. Reenie has been long dead by the time Iris tells her story, but she is as distinct and memorable as Iris herself.Finally, unlike most so-called "literary" fiction I've read or attempted to read these days, the book and its finale aren't bleak and depressing. True, there are tragedies and unhappiness, but the strong voice of Iris -- a woman who has lived a long, complicated life -- imparts a feeling of wisdom and redemption at the end.
