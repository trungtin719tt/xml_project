Update 5/16: Not a movie but a show now! It looks good but I hope more focus is given to the science bits vs. the Amy and Wolgast storyline.http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/the-pa...This was such an amazing novel. Sure it was insanely long and sometimes could be so intense that you just had to give yourself a break even though you felt you just couldn't stop no matter what... but was well worth it.This is a novel about a transformed world full of vampires, but it is nothing like anything out there today and is the most original story I have read in a long time. The details of all the storylines and the depth shown in each and everyone of the characters... this was a treat, a gem, and I am so glad to have read this novel. This has certainly become one of my all-time favorites.The ending though? Well I can honestly say I was a bit frustrated because I wanted MORE. I will just have to be patient and wait till 2012 when the next one comes out. :) Guess you have to expect that with series reads.
