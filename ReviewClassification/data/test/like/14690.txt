The Girl with the Dragon Tattooread quickly and really liked it! Some reviewers have critcized the amount of backstory provided at the beginning of this book, but I thought it was all relevant and ultimately added to the whole story. This book was a good introduction to those who would become the central characters of the series.The Girl Who Played with Firewas a little slower getting started. Of the three titles this was the one I liked the least. It is important for character development and further information about Lisbeth Salander, who becomes the focus of books 2 and 3. We learn where Salander's self-sufficiency originates and more fully understand many of her attitudes.The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nestcontinues the focus on Salander as her supporters prepare for her trial. It seemed odd that a person lying in hospital could still play such a strong and central role in the story.I very much enjoyed this trilogy and am very sad that Larsson's death leaves us with only these three volumes, at least so far, with only a glimmer of hope that a possible fourth title may appear one day. I appreciated his sensitivity and development of Salander's character. It was nice to read books with strong female characters in central and active roles. It was also uplifting to see them defeat those who were trying to victimize them. An important aspect of Salander's character, pointed out by many, is her refusal to accept the traditional role of victim. It was as if she drew strength from being victimized and "took on the world," so to speak, to reject that characterization both of herself and in the view of others. The large number of characters, while a bit daunting to handle at the outset, does make the story lines in books 2 &amp; 3 seem more realistic. No murder investigation is carried out or resolved by the efforts of a single person, as some murder mysteries would have us believe. This is a series of books that really needs to be read together in publication order to be best appreciated.The inclusion of the short bookOn Stieg Larssonwas a bonus in helping to gain further insight into Larsson from the perspectives of his editor and friends. Most poignant were the email references to "we have plenty of time" to address this or that and the only deadlines dealt strictly with publication schedules. This serves to remind us how fleeting life can be. Overall an engrossing read and wonderful series to which we have really been only introduced.
