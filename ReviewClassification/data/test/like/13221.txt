This is more like a 4.5 out of 5.I loved this book so much. Such an original twisted story.I got a little confused over all the japanese names but luckily once they started to die off I got to grips with who a lot of them were.I love books that have some short chapters and some long chapters.The student count at the end of each chapter.Loved shogo.Also LOVED the end. Even though I seen the movie years ago i had forgot what happened.Brillant
