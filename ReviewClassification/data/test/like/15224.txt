What an amazing book.Wolfe not only tells a great story but is a master of the English language and his prose is rich with multi-layered metaphors, symbolism, allusions, and I was fascinated by the various references to Edgar Allan Poe.I was sorry to finish it. I must now watch the movie again if nothing else to highlight how pale a medium is film when compared to literature.A modern classic.
