Damn books that make you feel like a yo-yo. It's so addictive. And damn you Gideon Cross. I've fallen for you yet I don't know why. I hate how big of an asshole you are, I hate how you've treated Eva. I understand this installment, but I have many questions. All beginning with Corrine. I.DO.NOT.LIKE.HER.Again this is an old book, I'm behind the times here. Review will be short and simple. I'm loving this series, one i'd so recommend to you if you haven't read it yet. The characters are so well built. I'm riding this journey right along with them. I have no time for more, I have to read on!!
