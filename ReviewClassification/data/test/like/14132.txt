William Faulkner's thesis through Absalom! Absalom! and The Sound and the Fury (novels that share characters and setting) goes something like this: The South fell because it was built on the blood and sweat (no tears from these men) of extremely ambitious men who lacked any compassion for others. Their utter disregard for others leads to theirs and ultimately the South's fall. Enter Thomas Sutpen in Absalom! Absalom!, the lowest of low characters ever created. He happily does things to relatives and close friends that are quite unimaginable throughout and often in the novel. This thesis and its presentation through Sutpen's saga is enough for an awesome novel but I am sure you remember that Faulkner writes in stream of consciousness with no linear plot. This adds the study of memory to the book and reveals just how warped and unreliable our memories are. The cherry on the top of this novel sundae is that Faulkner takes a meta-moment by having a character complain about how another character tells stories with no logic and with a confusing nonlinear chronology. Faulkner is a master for so many reasons. Absalom! Absalom! is one of the best pieces of evidence of his genius.
