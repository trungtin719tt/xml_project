I waged a personal debate for this five-star rating, arguing what exactly makes a book great. With every question, I returned to the story itself has the ability to lift a book above more average efforts.'The Story of Edgar Sawtelle' is just that, a great story. A modern retelling of 'Hamlet'? Certainly, the author availed himself of the plot to frame his tale of a mute boy and a remarkable group of dogs, but there is much more to be enjoyed among these pages.There are the languid narrative passages, vast and breathtaking paragraphs describing the north Wisconsin woods, the Sawtelle farm, the intensity of training dogs and the detailed geneology required to classify a breed. Make no mistake, if you like a fast read, this book isn't for you, the author's finely drawn sentences are meant to slow the reader, to step out of your hectic reality and allow yourself to dream.As an aspiring writer myself, I understood how the author labored over every sentence, every word choice, he wanted everything to be perfect. That he was in labor for ten years with his story makes one wonder what he must of felt when he finished.Some might argue the necessity for such extended prose. Are all those expanded descriptions really helping the story? Who the fuck am I to even dare that question? It all comes down to the story and when I am nearly breathless as a story comes to its inevitable end, such criticisms seem pointless. I shuddered at the two typos (pages 164 &amp; 430), and for a time, those oversights in editing threatened a great story.Edgar Sawtelle is an unforgettable character, like Huck Finn, or Ignatius O'Reilly, or Holly Golightly. He'll be an old friend for the rest of my life.
