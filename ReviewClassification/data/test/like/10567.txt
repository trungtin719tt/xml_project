Review to come and other reviews on my blog (bio)-------------------------------------------------------------------I never read these books, but saw them everywhere on goodreads and they looked fun. Well, fun not. This series is tragic and sad. I felt so bad for the kids and you wish it will all come to a good end. It was very quick to read and the story was great. I can imagine children picking these up and loving them.:)
