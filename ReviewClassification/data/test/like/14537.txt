There is nothing warm and fuzzy about this book. In fact, every time you pick it up to read it and set it back down, you will feel like you dropped your ice cream cone in the sand.It's torture. It's hell. And it's about as real as a novel can get.This book tells the story of three friends and their pursuit of the American dream. It also includes the story of the mother of one of the characters. They are all addicts. The friends are addicted to heroin and cocaine and mom is addicted to prescription diet pills.I felt something for each of these characters and I desperately wanted to reach into the book and save them.Addiction tears the lives apart and they turn on each other. There is no happy ending for any of them. It's a nightmare ending for all four.It's an extremely harsh story but the author made no attempt to cover up drug addiction and paint it as something pretty.It's one of the sickest stories I've ever read. It's one of the saddest stories I've ever read. And it's one of the greatest stories I've ever read. Hubert Selby Jr. is a tremendous author and you will feel every sentence.
