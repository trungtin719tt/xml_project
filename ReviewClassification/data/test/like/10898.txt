4.0 stars. Stephen King knows how to tell a story and this is another good example of his talent for world-building and plotting. Having read this, it is amazing to me that this story was not originally intended as part of the "Dark Tower" universe because the tie-ins are "in your face" for most of the story. In fact, as a huge fan of the Dark Tower series, one of the only reasons that I did not enjoy this story even more is because it wasn't expressly connected to that larger story and so read a little bit like Dark Tower "Lite." That minor gripe aside, this is a great read and I look forward to reading the sequel,Black House, which I understand "retroactively" makes the connection of this story to the Dark Tower.
