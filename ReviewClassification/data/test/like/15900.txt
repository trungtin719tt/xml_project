I had read it before - but revisited it recently. What I loved most this time is the controversy that swirled around the book - I had no idea. Lots of readers like this for the non-violence, peace choosing theme, but that message doesn't seem accurate. I like that Ferdinand chooses to do what he loves - he doesn't judge,criticize nor disparage the other bulls who want to fight- he just wants to smell flowers. The stronger message for me is to find what makes you happy and do that regardless of what others (society) tells you.Ferdinand's mom doesn't receive a lot of press, which is too bad, as she should be a model for parents everywhere. She worries about Ferdinand when he is young as he is always off by himself and she was concerned that he would be lonesome. He explains to her that what he is doing is making him happy and - she listens. Wow. Then the best line in the book as far as I'm concerned is "His mother saw that he was not lonesome, and because she was an understanding mother, even though she was a cow, she let him just sit there and be happy." You go mom.Finally, once I really started looking at Robert Lawson's illustrations with lots of help from the internet - I was blown away.The historical timeframe of this book, published just as World War II is ramping up, also intrigued me. That, in and of itself, was fascinating.A little book - a lot of punch.
