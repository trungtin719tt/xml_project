Updated Review - Re-read May 2019Have you ever been watching a movie in the middle of summer that takes place in the middle of a very cold winter? Even though it is 90 degrees outside you start to feel like you need to bundle up under a blanket. That happened to me with the movie The Day After Tomorrow. I had a similar response to The Long Walk. As I read, I could feel the exhaustion and I was waiting for my legs to cramp. When you can truly feel a book deep in your muscles and bones, you know it is a good one!My audio re-read of The Long Walk in May of 2019 marks the 3rd or 4th time I have read it. It has always been one of my favorite dystopian novels and I have enjoyed it every single time. Long before the dystopian government in America (Panem) made Katniss battle it out in the Hunger Games, Ray Garraty was dragging his feet across the hot macadam of the backroads and turnpikes of Maine. All for what you ask? The honor of participating the the oppressive government's premier event, the entertainment of the people, and the always elusive fulfilment of all your heart's desires.A few people that I recommended this to before didn't care for it, but it is definitely one of my top five favorite of King's - and my favorite of his Bachman books. Such great storytelling, character building, suspense, and dark narrative. I have just always been so awed by this book and how much it has pulled me in over and over again and won't let go!Read this! But, you may want to avoid it if you are getting ready for a marathon or a big hike!ORIGINAL REVIEWThis is one of my favorite King books; Suspenseful, unique, and all too possible. It is one of the few books that I have read more than once. Highly recommended for someone looking for a good place to start with King.
