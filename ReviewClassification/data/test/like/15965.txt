The book is another romantic novel by Nicholas sparks that took place in South Carolina. I loved the fact that this book had an element of suspense added to it. It was difficult for me to put down this book and it took me less time to finish it than I anticipated. I once came home and sat on the couch and stayed there reading every word of the book for three straight hours without noticing the hours that went by. I loved the plot, the choices of words. moreover, the characters seemed real to me and convince-able. And the metaphors and descriptions were out of this world. I liked the fact that for each character there is a detailed story or background and that for each setting there is a detailed description. in addition, he captured the emotions clearly and carefully and I truly felt the romantic spark between the two main characters, Alex and Katie. I felt the pain of the abusive husband thanks to the descriptions of the physical and mental pain, the love of a single father thanks to the never ending concerns that were straight forward and the ones that were hidden between the lines and that were apparent to me thanks to the sense of reality and the choice of words and how they blend well together, and Alex's love towards Katie. I loved that there was a surprise ending that no one and I mean no one would have saw it coming. In light of the above, I learned a lot from the way Nicholas Sparks writes and I believe that I could use that in my own personal writings when it comes to writing short stories or even novels. I wish there would be a sequel to this story, because it's still lingering in my mind and I believe that it will always stay with me from how much I've loved and enjoyed it and from how much I've learned from it. The writing was simple, realistic and full of emotions.
