.I originally read this U.S. Historical fiction book about 20 years ago. My daughter had to read it for a school assignment, so we read it at the same time. We shared many a laugh over the shenanigans referred into this glimpse in a small southern town, Cold Sassy, Georgia and set in 1906. This timeless treasure explores themes such as religion, death, and social taboos, and certainly has the ability to entertain with hilarious wit and humor.Grandpa teased her about it. "You look like you done swallored a goose aigg, Miss Mattie Lou, and it got stuck in yore goozle."This story is told in the POV of a 14-year-old boy by the name of Will Tweedy. The reader is provided with intricate details, through his perception, about the events that encompassed this young's mans early life. Will reveals his brilliant imagination by making up stories and pulling pranks. He experienced many firsts, most notably driving the first two automobiles in the town. His dream was to become a successful farmer, which he was determined he could do with education at the A.G. College.His patriarch grandfather, Rucker E. Blakeslee, is a most influential man in the small town and had a monumental influence in young Will Tweedy's life. Grandpa owns the general store and lives by his own rules. After his wife passes away, he creates quite a ruckus with his impetuous decisions. He favors Will Tweedy over others in the family and demands a lot from him in return. Will Tweedy certainly admired him, at least most of the time.The setting was described vividly, the characters were well-developed,and the plot was captivating. This book was originally published in November 1984. I own the paperback book and have it on my Kindle. If you enjoy a good storyteller about southern fiction, this is well worth the time and effort to read. If you are looking for some chuckles and reminiscing of days gone by, you will also enjoy this immensely. I recommend it to one and all!
