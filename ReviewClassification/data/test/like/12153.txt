I enjoyed this, even though it was about a tragic part of American history. I walked into this nonfiction book expecting a history report of sorts. While it was that, I was so happy that it wasn't dry. This was fascinating and the narrator of the audio version, did a fabulous job.It was interesting to see this part of American History from the Native American perspective. Their story is heartbreaking and sad, but absolutely necessary to read and to understand. I firmly believe that when people show you who they really are, you don't ask for a repeat performance. So many times, tribe after tribe, believed the government promises and time and time again, they were just lies.
