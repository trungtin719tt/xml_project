Madeline L'Engle is possibly one of the most thoroughly brilliant people ever to turn hand to novel-writing. The depth, scope, and passion in each of her books is thrilling; her characters are not only believable, but the sort who become your friends. I frequently find myself coming back to these books just to spend more time with Meg, Charles Wallace, and Calvin. The science that weaves its way through these gems of literary perfection just heightens their believability and depth. Nobody can make me cry quite like Madeline L'Engle.
