Actual rating: 4.5Oh my God...I have no words this was amazing! The ending had me freaking out it was so tense, ahhh I'm so scared for book 3.The story was so good, usually 2nd books in series are all boring, but I kept reading and reading waiting to see what happened. The plot builds so well and I absolutely loved Cole! His character is amazing and I loved his POV chapters.Honestly these books the different POVs work so well, like you can really tell who you're reading from and they all work so good within the story! I'm usually not a fan when there's more than 2 POVs but 4 actually worked so great, I'm so falling in love with Maggie's writing.This was almost a 5 star again like the first book but there was just a bit of unneeded romance that I could live without so yeah /-\ It was great though! I need everyone to read this series like rn...I'm gonna go start book 3...
