Summer A Thon: Read book that has a road trip or travelingI was nervous guys. I read this series years ago when I was a teenager and a loved them. I loved both films too. But I was worried that as an adult I wouldn't enjoy it as much. I worried that nearly 20 years later it wouldn't hold up as well.I'm happy to say that for me it still holds up. As I read this book it didn't feel 18 years old. Maybe my nostalgia blinded me but it felt like a story that could be taking place at any period in time.I plan to reread the whole series this summer and then rewatch the movies. We shall see if this series continues to be one of my favorite book series or if I've out grown them ( Spoiler Alert: It will always be in my top 5)
