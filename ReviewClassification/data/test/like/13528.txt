Amazing. If I wasn't sure before, this book solidifies Juliet Marillier as one of my very favourite authors.The story of Sorcha and her trials as she works to free her six brothers from enchantment is painful and gut wrenching. While it doesn't all result in a traditional fairy tale ending, the story does deliver what feels right and more true to our own experiences. No one can live through what Sorcha and her brothers do without being irrevocably changed.Marillier's writing is perfect as usual, and her characters are lifelike and filled with emotion. This book delivers both heartbreak and joy, and not in equal measure, but the joy is all the more satisfying for it having been so hard won.
