Wow wow wow wow wow. Requiem for a Dream manages to be so painful and beautiful at the same time. Although I'd seen the film before I read this book and knew the fate of the characters, I was still following their paths with such anxiety and hope. It's an account of people who dream big but lose much bigger.It follows four characters in the Bronx. There's Sarah, a widow who spends her days living vicariously through her television while eating boxed chocolates. On the warm days, she joins her lifelong neighbors for chatting and sunbathing outdoors. When she receives a phone call informing her that she's been specially selected to participate in a new game show, her heart swells with anticipation. She recovers her red dress from her glory years, gets her hair colored a matching blaze, and begins obsessively dieting in order to fit into the dress once again, imagining herself being admired on TV and being the envy of the block. Sarah's son Harry, along with his best friend Tyrone and girlfriend Marion, are meanwhile doing some serious summer partying. Harry and Tyrone begin dealing heroin (plotting to score the pure stuff), and bringing in big bucks at first until the supply and demand of the streets catches up with them in the following winter months. Harry and Marion, who were once planning on taking the drug money and opening an artsy coffee shop, soon see their aspirations fade away. As their addictions worsen they become more and more desperate for a fix, going to extreme lengths they would have never stooped to in their purer days. Sarah remains on a parallel downward spiral, going back and forth between uppers and downers, practically oblivious to the devastating effects the pills are having on her health.Selby's depictions of the 80s south Bronx are nightmarish--corpses in abandoned buildings, addicts faking each other out just so their lives can be spared. The writing style itself lends to atypical punctuation, marathon sentences, and street dialect, yet the style doesn't detract from the book's readability. The descriptions and the careful layering of the book's events will leave readers cringing as their hearts break for these characters.The characters experience little warmth from the outside world of hospitals, medical clinics, and jails. While their need to be saved is so obvious, Selby paints a system that methodically grinds their faces in the dirt, whether it be to prejudice, profit, or just general apathy.In the preface Selby states that "the book is about four individuals who pursued the American Dream, and the results of their pursuit." He ends the preface with: "Unfortunately, I suspect there never will be a requiem for the Dream, simply because it will destroy us before we have the opportunity to mourn its passing. Perhaps time will prove me wrong. As Mr. Hemingway said, 'Isn't it pretty to think so?'"
