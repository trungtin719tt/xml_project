If I could give more stars, I totally would:)Wow! I'm blown away and in complete awe of this book!I don't want to say to much about the story itself since everyone just needs to pick this up A.S.A.P, but I will say that it's Incredible!Julie Kagawa has out did herself. To every reviewer who saidThe Iron Daughterwas better then the first, wasn't kidding!I am in love with this series, this book, these characters.With hauntingly rich and vivid writing Julie has once again captured the attention of her readers, giving us a pure and gripping plot that you can't help but devour the minute you touch it. This world is so engaging, entertaining and enchanting that it's hard to get your mind wrapped around it, not that it's difficult, just simply mind-boggling. It is so much fun to read!All your favorite characters are back in all there glory and then some!I am so proud of Meghan, and I love being proud of the characters I read about, so that's a big plus. She's strong and feisty and stubborn and I love that she fights back with everything that she has.I was very torn between Puck and Ash, two of my favorite characters who equally won over my heart. Puck has always been such a dear. Kind, funny and play's the part of "the right one" for Meghan. The sensible choice, the better choice. But with all love triangle, it seems that better may not always be best. Never the less, I love them both, but if it were me, I'd have to go with Ash!Ash, ah Ash, if you loved him before? You'll love him even more! He really went through an emotional hell in this book and I found myself flipping through the pages at a feverish pace to find out what would happen next. He's definitely on my list of favorite book swoon-crushes. Totally and completely love him. I wanna keep him. Mine.Oh, and I so want a cat like Grimalkin!I could go on forever gushing about this amazing book, so I'm just going to say thatThe Iron Daughteris a fast paced thrill ride with a plot concept that is truly unbelievably brilliant. The romance is a beautiful wonder that makes me smile, and Julie Kagawa is a genius for creating an amazing take on this particular paranormal, it makes me love it when I don't favor it all that much to begin with, so that is really saying something.This is definitely on the top of my list of all time favorites! Loved every second of this epic adventure and I am crazily waiting to see how this beloved series will wrap up inThe Iron Queen!!If you haven't read the first one *cough Arlene&amp;Morgan cough* then you need to pick it up! You wont be disappointed!A.Must.Read.!
