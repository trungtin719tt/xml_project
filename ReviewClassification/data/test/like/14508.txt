"Night World" is basically a series of short paranormal romance stories for young adults. The premise here is that there are Night People (vampires, witches, werewolves) who live among regular humans and who are prohibited from disclosing any information about the secret world or fall in love with mortals. Each story in the series is about a supernatural creature falling in love with a regular person.The first story "Secret Vampire" is centered around Poppy, who just found out she has a terminal form of cancer and has weeks to live. The only way for her to continue her existence is to be turned a vampire, and accidentally her long-time best friend and crush James is a vampire who could help her out. It's a nice story, with quite a morbid air about it due to scenes of death, funeral, grave digging, etc."Daughters of Darkness" is a kind of a mystery which follows 3 vampire sisters arriving to a small town. Their vampire aunt is recently killed, and a series of equally disturbing events follows. Human sister and brother Mark and Mary-Lynnette get accidentally involved in the whole ordeal. They discover the true nature of their strange neighbors and to add to it, Mary-Lynnette finds out that she is a soulmate of the sisters' arrogant brother Ash and can't do anything about it. This story is more light-hearted and Ash has some great lines here.The last story in the book "Spellbinder" is about two witch cousins. When her cousin Blaise, a witch of the black arts, sets her sights on star athlete Eric, white witch Thea casts a spell on the young man to protect him and falls in love despite the rules that forbid their relationship. A lot of witchcraft and spells is in this book which I liked quite a bit.By current YA standards L.J. Smith's books seem almost juvenile. There is no sex, no drugs, or any gruesome violence, but I like her stories anyway. She knows how to develop her characters, her stories are imaginative and romance scenes are very sweet and touching in an innocent way. I still think that Smith's "Dark Visions" and "The Forbidden Game" trilogies are better, but these "Night World" are nicely done too and I will definitely continue on with the series.Reading challenge: #14, 1 of 4
