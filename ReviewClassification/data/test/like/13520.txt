***Warning**** Mention of rape and discussion of such follows.I gave this book four stars so obviously I did enjoy it. There are actually many, many enjoyable elements to this book and I promise to get to them in a moment...I found myself so COMPLETELY annoyed with Daughter of the Forest though I really enjoyed the book. We are treated to the terrible acts committed against Sorcha and it's rather graphic at moments. Yet when it comes to consensual, loving sex - nothing. Fade to black the moment they enter the bedroom with only a passing comment that she had a moment of fear that was passed when lovingly consoled.WHY?! Fuck if I know! I've read this so often in so many books. WHY is it okay to be descriptive of rape in books and to actually give a full account of what happens (or at least, close to) but loving, consensual, normal sex is not okay. If you write about that it goes in the romance genre? Is that why? Shouldn't we have examples of this kind of healthy relationship for people to read? Shouldn't healthy, happy sex be prevalent in books as the norm? Not rape, not gratuitous violent sex! Why does sex go in the romance section and the rape get to stay out of the shelves for us to read?And the casual, dismissive attitude by the Fairy characters of this book made me furious."You are not the first woman of your race to be abused thus by men, nor will you be the last."So... what you're saying is, "Get over it. Happens all the time."My compliments to the fairy folk for providing this opinion. My only response is: fuck you, fairy bitches!I'm not going to go into the rape aspect of this story any further than to say that the author at least did a good job of showing the after psychological effects and the long term damage that this act causes - so I wasn't all pissed off.The book started slow, but as I said, I enjoyed it. The characters were beautiful, interwoven with fantasy and historical life. The forest took on a life of its own as another character in the book.The character of Red was great, so were the other minor characters in the book. Over all, I enjoyed the beautiful story and the writing which was full and descriptive.It broke my heart at the end because it wasn't all joy and not all hurts could be healed. I suppose that's what made the story so sad and almost real though it was so firmly planted in fantasy.Well written, with a female protagonist worthy of the title "heroine" and an all round cast of great characters and a masterfully woven story, I did actually quite like this book.Its not one I would read again as it's very long. I don't know if I'll have the emotional energy to pick up the second book. But I'm glad I read it and that says something I suppose.*Kat goes off to find some damn good chocolate*
