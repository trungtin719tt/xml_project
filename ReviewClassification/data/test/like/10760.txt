I have an urge to shout "You're killin' me Smalls!!" I also love anyone who understands that reference. In any case, I am extremely excited and impatiently awaiting this book. I wish I had known before hand what kind of crazy a** ending Dreamfever was going to have and then I would have waited to read it--scratch that, I should have waited for the whole series. On the other hand, it is rather interesting to develop my own alternate endings for the series. Does anyone else do this?Also, I'm tempted to read KMM's Highlander series but to be honest, they sound kind of .... boring when I read their synopsis. So if anyone who loved the Faefever series likes them, let me know and I'll work on getting over my prejudice.
