(Wow. Aren't I talented. :D)After reading:1) I want to marry Adrian Ivashkov.2) I want a Callistana. (Do not google what that is.)Every second I spent waiting for this book to come out was WORTH it.Indigo Spell = SO, SOOO awesome.That college party scene!And THE FREAKINGCALLISTANA(view spoiler)[ aka Sidney's and Adrian's baby dragon love child.(hide spoiler)]!I laughed so hard. Seriously, any scene with that thing was hilarious.And EVERY SINGLE SYDNEY/ADRIAN scene was jhufdkshfdshdhf!!!"I have a hickey. I let Adrian Ivashkov give me a hickey.""Metaphors. This was the cost of making out with an artist."The endingI didn't want this book to ever end. But it did, and here's what I thought of the ending (only read this if you've finished the book, because, well,spoilers.)(view spoiler)[Who else thought she was going to go to Mexico with Marcus? I was SO SURE. When they were driving to the station and Sidney was looking back at the skyline, I was so sad and I kept thinking"Oh no, this is why The Fiery Heart will be told from both their perspectives. Because they won't be together. Because Sidney will be in Mexico. With Marcus. Oh, noooo. Noooo, Sydney. Whyyyy."And then, when she DIDN'T, I was like YES!! Yes, yes, yes. And who cares about stupid Zoe being back when SYDNEY and ADRIAN are FINALLY TOGETHER. Yay, yay, yay!!(hide spoiler)]Before I read this, I was all:7 DAYS TILL THIS COMES OUT!!!Wooooh![image error]I AM SO EXCITED FOR THIS BOOK!!!!OH MY GOD.
