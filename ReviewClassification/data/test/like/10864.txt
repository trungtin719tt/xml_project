Probably the weakest so far, but scraped 4 stars and still funMore tomorrow :)Right I have been thinking about this review all day. It was the weakest of the books so far with what felt almost like a padded out story and I was thinking it would be a 3 star read. That said i didn't bank on Puddleglum, he was the real star of the book and added enough to make me give it 4 stars.The book features the Pevensie's cousin Eustace, now a Narnian regular and a "jolly good chap" with a schoolfriend of his rescuing Prince Caspian's heir. A fun romp, made enjoyable by the appearance of Marsh-Wiggles and the owls :)
