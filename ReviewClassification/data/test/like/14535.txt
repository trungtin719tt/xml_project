I'm not even sure where to begin.This book was incredibly hard, and at times painful, to read. The opening scene is of a young man and his friend taking his mother's television to the pawn shop to get money for heroin. Although there is nothing funny about that when you really think about it, I thought that I was in for a sad story told in a comical way. I mean this t.v. has been pawned by the boy and then bought back by the mom so many times that the pawn shop owner has a book to record the transactions. That's almost funny, right? No, it's not. I think Selby made this scene verge on the comical to ease us into the despair and depravity waiting in the following pages.I read a lot so reading about drugs is not new or scandalous to me, but this was written as if I, the reader, should be well versed in Heroin. I'm not. My association with it goes about as far as the movies Gia and Trainspotting. This was so, so intensely bad. I felt dirty as I read. I didn't have an understanding of most of the terms associated with the drug that Harry (the boy in the opening scene) Tyrone, and Marion were in love with. As I read I grew to understand more and more, but at the same time I understood less and less. How could you let yourself get into such dire straits for something so nasty? It was just...gross! The idea of needles is icky on it's own, but I looked up Heroin and pretty much everything to do with it is disgusting. I mean everything. You feel withdrawal after 6 hours! I'll just stick to the occasional drink, thanks.In addition to those three's Heroin addiction, Harry's mom is addicted to t.v. This addiction leads to an addiction to speed and Valium, which she innocently discovers in an effort to trim down and look good for her television debut. I found it infinitely clever the way Selby traces her addictions alongside the other three. She just wants to lose weight, be healthy, look good, fit in the dress she wore to her son's Bar Mitzvah. How could that be wrong? I could identify on some level with her addiction and increasingly downward spiral because of it's commonness. As I continued to read I began to identify with the Heroin addicts as well because Selby made it clear that addiction is addiction. Plain and simple. Too much of anything, for any reason, even the pursuit of a dream, it too damn much!LikeE.E. CummingsandCormac McCarthy, Selby disregards quotation marks and apostrophes. It makes for difficult reading in the beginning, but as I continued to read I understood his disdain. As the characters became increasingly depraved, who the hell cares about punctuation? To understand their dialogue takes effort and I'm glad. I wouldn't want to understand them easily. I want there to be a disconnect between myself and these pitiful creatures. The lack of punctuation allowed me to keep that distance.This book was bleak and painful to read, but it was incredibly well written. Not all stories are rainbows and sunshine and this could not have been further from that, but it was well told nonetheless.
