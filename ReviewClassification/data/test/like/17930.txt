Charles Johnston's English translation of Eugene Onegin is a ridiculously pleasurable read, charming and comprehensible, a story filled with tragedy yet somehow made amusing and comical in the telling. Every 14-line stanza follows anababccddeffeggscheme, and the novel is as structured as the stanzas ("like a perfect curve or parabola," the introduction proclaims), with Eugene and Tatyana at two opposing emotional poles at the outset, then each undergoing a 180 degree transformation and ending up where the other was (and still apart). Apparently Johnston's translation captures the spirit of Pushkin's verse - here's a sample -I see another problem looming:to save the honour of our landImusttranslate - there's no presuming -the letter from Tatyana's hand:her Russian was as thin as vapour,she never read a Russian paper,our native speech had never sprungunhesitating from her tongue,she wrote in French...what a confession!what can one do? as said above,until this day, a lady's lovein Russian never found expression,till now our language - proud, God knows -has hardly mastered postal prose.- while Nabokov's unrhyming translation (he scorned rhyming attempts) reproduces its literal meaning.
