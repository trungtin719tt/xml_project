4.5 Stars.Full review to come.Ari and Janco are my favorite!! Of course I love Valek and Yalena, but Ari and Janco are my puppies!! I guess I have a thing for adorable/funny twins!! So much love!!!!!It's been more than 7 years since i read this book. Time to finish this series!! I've had these books for a while now, the pages have turned yellowish, and they smell like old books. I love it.First line of the book:"Locked in darkness that surrounded me like a coffin,i had nothing to distract me from my memories."Katie Mcgrath is my Yelena..[image error]
