A delight (&amp; the first of Gaiman's books that I've read to get the full ***** from me)! It's got that outrageous "Freaky Friday"/Prince &amp; the Pauper narrative; Britishisms a-la Evelyn Waugh; and a peck of Douglas Adams's brand of whimsy (this is infinitely better than Hitchhiker's Guide, &amp; much better than the author's own Stardust AND Neverwhere). It's adorably Beetlejuician!! What's not to like, huh?
