Well, this felt a bit like a spider getting drunk while reading a history of literary genres, and then spinning a thread and getting all tangled up in the different genres himself while trying to make sense of the pattern he created.The web is a fable posing as a detective story posing as an embarrassing coming of age and heartbreak story mixed with fantasy and crime, put in a treasure chest and shipped off to the pirates of the Caribbean, where it decides to change shape and take a chapter's break in the realm of spooky ghost stories, before wrapping up as a social satire on the nature of love and happiness.To be fair, the author added the most accurate and funny description of a monstrous hangover I have ever read, and while letting the reader look like a question mark most of the time, he also makes several of the reader's days by creating laughing-out-loud moments of nonsensical, witty humour in the middle of a comedy which could have the subtitle "the tragedy of the human condition".Bowing to Sartre's existentialism, he also creates a mini-hell of his preferred definition: "l'enfer, c'est les autres", and instead of eternally grilling humans in their frustrating interaction in the closed-off hell-cave, he lets a dark and mean and dumb-as-a-brick brutal god go bonkers whenever a tiny ex-human says something annoyingly irritating. Killing it off is a meaningless feat, of course, as it plays the honorable part of Prometheus' liver in this firework of storytelling:"Stories are like spiders, with all they long legs, and stories are like spiderwebs, which man gets himself all tangled up in but which look pretty when you see them under a leaf in the morning dew, and in the elegant way that they connect to one another, each to each."That is a wisdom I will cherish from now on, but even deeper layers of learning were reached in the important science of how to wear a demanding hat and how not to blame a lime for the pickle you're in!Neil Gaiman is the god of storytellers - which might well be a curse in his universe, as gods are constantly in trouble for having too much imagination and too little impulse control. They're a perfect mirror of their creators, obviously.Wonderful, spidery, funny, - beyond the realm of descriptive adjectives!
