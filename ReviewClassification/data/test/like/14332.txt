I originally read Mystic River back in 2011, but in order to prepare for a future Literary Gladiators discussion, I felt the need to refresh myself of this text and felt that now would be the perfect time to do so. I am certainly glad that I refreshed myself, for I feel that the text did not stick with me through these years. This time around, I certainly got a lot more out of this very well fleshed out, yet very haunting story about three childhood friends that break apart following a horrific incident, but are brought back together due to circumstances when they are adults.The childhood friends of note happen to be Jimmy Marcus, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle. Jimmy is the reckless rebel that likes to stare trouble right in the eyes. Sean is his friend in the way that they hang out weekly, due to the fact that their fathers are co-workers and close friends. Dave becomes a friend of Jimmy's through school and comes off as being his second fiddle. Jimmy leads them into plenty of troubling situations and when Sean questions them, Jimmy and then Dave pressure him into going along. This all changes when they are driving underage and are caught by men disguised as cops that take Dave away. Dave is saved, but his life is changed forever.As adults, Jimmy lives a reckless lifestyle until a prison sentence and being left with a daughter, Katie, seems to straighten him up. He then marries Annabeth (his second wife) and has two more daughters, Sara and Nadine, while also running a convenient store. Dave marries Annabeth's cousin, Celeste, and has a son named Michael. Dave's life has become more unstable and after Katie is murdered while going out and drinking with her girlfriends, Dave puts a target on his back following the fact he was drinking at the same bar around the same time as Katie and comes home covered in blood. Sean has joined law enforcement and becomes one of the officers investigating this particular murder.The four stars that I am giving this book are generous, for I am pondering on whether or not it deserved 4 or 3.5. Why it gets 4 is because of the structure of the characters and how they clearly drive this piece. They are all flawed in some way, shape, or form, but yet that is what makes them perfectly human. They make mistakes, plenty of which prove to be life changing and while many of these are irrevocable, life does go on and the only way to change things is to find the motive to move on. The complications in each of these characters leads you to question who it is you should truly feel pity for and just like the game show Russian Roulette, if you hedge your pity onto any singular character, chances are your feelings are going to drop just as the unlucky contestant falls through the trapdoor. That is exactly what makes for a great thriller, though!I must say that I preferred Shutter Island more than I did this book. Shutter Island stuck with me and continues to linger in my head. While I can say that reading this book provided me with a powerful experience that leaves a lingering effect that can be compared to heartburn, it still took me an additional attempt. I can also hear Bekka from my dreams of reading (whose channel you should check out) screaming "'said' is dead!" over and over again in my mind. I am not as nitpicky when it comes to the use of the word "said," but it is used frequently to describe what people are saying. Even questions are succeeded with the term "said" instead of "asked." There are some inconsistencies when it comes to sequence of events, such as skipping moments and encounters that we assumed are implied, though in some cases are meant to create a sense of effect on the reader. While some of these were meant to create a unique flow, there were other cases where it was just annoying.Despite some of the rigid sequence, I feel that Lehane did a great job fleshing out the characters and the atmosphere and did his very best to depict something brutal and heinous, but at the same time very honest. His characters were honest depictions, the process to which law enforcement has to abide was honest, and it made things all the more intriguing to read.You can find Bekka (who I mentioned in this review)'s channel here:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPPj...You can find the Literary Gladiators discussion about Mystic River (containing spoilers) here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWkNo...
