People have always told me that this was a dark series, but I didn't expect it to bethisdark! This is a children's book series?! :') It was great, I really enjoyed it!! I can't wait to carry on with this series, which to be honest, I wasn't expecting to feel! It was such an interesting, short and quick read andthankfullydidn't traumatise me or scar me for life like the movie did at eight years old...
