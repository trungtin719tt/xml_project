This book floored me. I enjoyed the previous two "To Live" books. They're funny, quirky, ala David Sedaris. Enjoyable enough. But this third installment, I must admit, blew my socks off. Part mystery, part fantasy, part all too harsh reality... Shawn Michals gets a fitting curtain call. I'm through reading it almost a second time and am still finding myself surprised how this character and author have matured. Without giving too much away, let's just say Shawn Michals gets in way over his head with love, politics, and his past. He pays several prices, but in the end they turn out to be ones worth paying. P.S. Bina (an awesome female character who emerges in this installment) I love you!
