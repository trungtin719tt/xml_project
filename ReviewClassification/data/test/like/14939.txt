Well in case you can't tell, I'm hooked on this series. It's so much more than the HBO True Blood series. I prefer the original story line versus the hatchet job they did to he books in favor of their own brand of sensationalism. This series keeps taking the Sookie character in new directions but all of them seem to be logical extensions of where she's come from. Yes, it's a wonderfully written series that keeps me looking forward to the next book in the series. I actually finished this book near the beginning of the weekend and am well into the next volume thanks to sitting by the bonfire this past chilly weekend. This is a great series to have outside by a warm fire, your favorite beverage and a cigar. The shadows hold extra meaning as you read the books. Yes, so far Ms. Harris has my devoted attention to her well written series!
