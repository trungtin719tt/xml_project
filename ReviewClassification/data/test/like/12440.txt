This was, in my opinion, the best of the series, and I now adore Rehvenge, whereas before I really didn't like him at all. That's the beauty of the WARDen's writing.She's really outdone herself!My birthday gift to myself was an autographed copy of this book. It came wrapped in birthday paper, has a birthday wish from the WARDen, and I LOVE IT!
