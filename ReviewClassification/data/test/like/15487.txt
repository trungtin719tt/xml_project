Reminded me of The Sun Also Rises. Sassy dame. Excessive drinking. Fishing.Except it's way more interesting because everyone is about to die in a few months from radiation poisoning! YEAH!! Plus the sassy dame is funnier, nicer, and drinks even more!! I know, I know. Hemingway and all that. But it's my review and I can compare this book to some classic if I want to. Anyway I don't like Hemingway. Please take that as saying more about me and my literary idiocy than it says about Hemingway and cram it in your cramhole.There are a couple of really lovely, admirable characters. Also a complete twit you'd like to bludgeon with a boomerang or a kookaburra or something else Australian. I always like for there to be at least one stupid twit for me to hate. Otherwise it just doesn't seem honest.This may be the least depressing novel ever written about the end of the human race. You'll see exactly zero shelter-building, panicking, or preparation of any kind. Most of the characters are in denial and just waste their last days puttering around like normal. Pretty unrealistic. But then again, who knows? Maybe that's just the way itwouldbe for lots of people. At any rate, a kookaburra is a bird and probably not the right thing to use for bludgeoning twits.
