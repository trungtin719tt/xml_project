This book had three stories combined into one huge book, and though they have different people as the main characters you can see all the stories start to combine into one huge story. Its about Vampires, werewolves, witches, anything that you can think of that is not normal. These creatures live on the fringes of society and they don't interact with humans too much except to feed or eat them, but some Night people fall in love with Humans and they challenge the rules and their death by telling the humans about their world, the Night World.I loved this book it was fast pace and i literally couldn't put it down until i had finished one of the stories. it was very exciting full of action making it a good read for just about anyone. It gave me a new perspective on certain life elements. So crack open those pages and fall into a book filled with romance and life threatening encounters.
