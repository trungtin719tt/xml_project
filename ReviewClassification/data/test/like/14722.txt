An isolated island, a raging hurricane, a locked room, secret codes, a mental hospital, and rumors of mysterious medical experiments frame the story. Written in a very different style compared to Lehane's previous novels Mystic river and Gone baby gone. The plot is not the simplest of plots, i was scratching my head intrigued because the story flips through past present and surreal. It is a disorienting, complex story grounded in the reality of the times...cold war USA in 1954. From pondering over the story carefully i find myself laughing now at how Lehane whipped and twisted the story until you are dumb founded just when you think you solved it you realize the opposite. You sense the feeling of being cheated in the story because when you start you set out wanting to finding the missing person but realize all is not what it seems, well i have to take my hat of to Lehane's creativity.http://more2read.com/?review=shutter-island-by-dennis-lehane
