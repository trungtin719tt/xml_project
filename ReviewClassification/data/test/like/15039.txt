I don't know who or what recommended this to me, but I loved it. It is hilarious, adventurous, fast-paced, and creative.In modern England, all the politicians and noblemen are magicians, and everyone else is a commoner. The story begins with a young but gifted apprentice magician summoning a djinni (genie), Bartimaeus. He sends Bart. off to steal the Amulet of Samarkand. This sets in motion a chain reaction of events that are perilous and fantastical and ultimately build up to a big climax. Eventually you learn why Nathaniel wanted the Amulet stolen. By beginning with the theft, the story avoids a slow beginning. The story shifts point of view between Bart. (first person) and the boy Nathaniel (third person).Bartimaeus is just hilarious, partly because of the British humor that is prevalent throughout the book. He has a big ego, he gets in trouble with his smart-Alec remarks, and he has great contempt for humans. The book on tape is narrated by Simon Jones (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy mini-series narrator), who does a great job.
