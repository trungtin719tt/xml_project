I must admit, at the thought of reading Butch's and Marissa's story i was all like...For those who don't know i wasNOT a big fan of them bothin the previous books. Butch i kinda hated, and Marissa seemed really pathetic to me. Not a great mix of emotions, true?Especially if you are the kind of reader (which i think the majority of us are) that ifyou do not care for the characters you do not care for the book.I am that type of reader, and that statement is accurate as that was exactly what happened withLover Revealed.But first...meet Marissa...Rejected.Invisible.Scandalous.Marissa is scarred in the society and in her own eyes ever since Wrath, the vampire's blind King, took a half-bred vampire as a mate. Marissa has been waiting for 3 centuries to be in her shoes.Now, everyone, even her, thinks she ain't good enough.But Butch O'Neal is about to change that.Broken.Loyal.Pushed aside.Even though Butch is now fighting his own demons (literally), he will show Marissa how much she is truly worth, and will heal her...but what about him?Will her love be enough to save HIM?Butch O'Neal is an ally and loyal friend of the Black Dagger Brotherhood, who will face the challenge of his life and the evil of the ages.Is he barely a pawn in a dangerous game between vampires and their slayers, or is he a winning card?I did not enjoyLover Revealeduntil i reached over 100 pages.That might be because Butch and Marissa really did start to grow on me.J.R Ward has proven that she is the kind of author who will most likely never disappoint.The way she writes her books, develops her characters, and captures your imagination is quite...exceptional.Her characters seem like realpeople because not only do they not sound similar (you can know who it is just by their talk), but also because they have something unique in them.This is not going to be a big review as everything that is to be said about this book, series, and author is already said in other people's awesome reviews.So go check them out if you want to know more!All i have got to say is thatBDB is THE BEST, and i can not wait to read the rest books in the series. :)
