Wonderful! Amazing &lt;3I'm sorry everyone, but this review will be full of gushing and little hearts and me being all crazy about a book I absolutely lovedSo, there are like a million reviews for this one, and I don't really feel like writing an extensive one, because honestly, YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THIS BOOK BEFORE YOU START IT!!!!That's how it was for me, I went into this totally blind, I had absolutely no idea what the book was about, I think I read the blurb but it still gave me nothing.And I am so glad for that! Everything was a surprise and I loved it from page ONE, which was a surprise because this was my first NA book, and I didn't think I'd even LIKE it, let alone LOVE!Anyway, I'll try to go through the most important things in the book.Prepare for a gush-fest!!!!!1. First scene in the bookLucas saves Jacqueline from an attempted rape, and that was insta-love for me &lt;3He was all heroic and sweet and just awesome &lt;32. The classes they take togetherShe sees him in class all the time and there are stolen glances everywhere and he keeps sketching things.Yes I know the stolen glances are so high-school, but they were sweet and they made me smile until my cheeks hurt like crazy :D3. The dance in the discoThat was swoony and hot and I think I totally fell in love with Lucas there! Such an awesome scene, I'd kill to see it in his POV!!!!!4. Something you need to know about LucasThere isn't one thing about him that I don't like. I know he's written that way, and sometimes it bothers me when the have no flaws, but here it just didn't!Anyway, he bites his lip a lot and rakes his fingers through his hair and has this half-smile going on all the time. For those of you who get irritated with those things, you'll probably be so here, but me, NOPE!! I loved it all, even with the lip biting and hands through hair and that half-smile that rarely went into a full one.He has a lip piercing and is tattooed over his arms and has a bike and he draws/sketches/paints, and teaches self-defense class and is just UBER!!!!!5. Something you need to know about JacquelineShe really DIDN'T go on my nerves! At all! It is pretty unbelievable because she's so young and well, I am not a fan of reading about young people in books, but there you go. No getting on nerves from her. So that's another reason I love this book!She does cry a few times, that I wish she didn't, but oh well, if I was 20-ish and went through attempt of rape and several other things, I'd be a mess as well.Anyway, she just broke up with her boyfriend with whom she'd been for three years, so she's a mess there too. She starts noticing and avoiding Lucas at the same time LOL6. The sketchingI loved every single scene that involved him sketching her, especially the first one!!! OMG it was amazing and wonderful &lt;37. Her ex and the bad guyHer ex is a total jerk and I want to hit him in the balls like they did in the defense class.The bad guy is a total jerk and I want to rip off his balls like they did in defense class.8. Lucas and Jacqueline are so wonderful together &lt;3I loved every single scene between them. Every. Single. Scene!9. There is something sad in Lucas's pastGosh I felt so bad for him :(((I thought it was one thing, but it turned out something completely different and even more terrible!!!I want to hug him like crazy!!!10. The ending is great and amazing and wonderful and all sorts of mushy things I can think of!Well, I don't think I need to say more about it :DOh yes, it made me cry &lt;3And so, end of gush-fest :DDDI completely and totally loved this book (shocker, right????)Considering I am NOT a fan of either YA or NA, I am surprised I loved it so much, but I am also glad because this book made it to my best books ever!Vishous - thanks so much for recommending this to me! Yes, you have created a monster!!!
