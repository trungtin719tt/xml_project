Tonight, I finished "Brave New World", a book published in 1932, by Aldous Huxley. Ironically I was wearing work boots and pants, and on the clock for a fortune five hundred company. A pawn, an epsilon if you may, in this world run on time, money, and class. His visions have come true in a sense, but just the fact that we can read such things proves different. But, it does give proof that maybe his new society had it right. If I had never read this book, or any book, or any free form of entertainment, I wouldn't know any better than what's right in front of me. Oblivious happiness. So, maybe the secret is to care a bit less, and stop looking so deeply? Well, if you never know, and if you never dare to know, then what the fuck is the point? To just work your life away, have meaningless sex, watch oatmeal tasting movies, and not know any better? To just pop a pill and settle for the mundane. To not think differently ever. Huxley for me confirms beliefs in the way I was brought up and taught to think and believe. To never stop asking questions, to always search for more, and to not be afraid of failure, in fact, embrace it, and learn from it. Keep dreaming, and keep learning.I recommend this and "Island" for a bit of an escape of everyday life.
