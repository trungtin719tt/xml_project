5 STARS!!!!!!!!! JESUS H. ROOSEVELT CHRIST!!!!!![image error]What can I say that hasn't already been said about Diana Gabaldon and her fabulous Outlander books!!! This is yet another. Claire and Jamie's story continues here in the wilderness and growing new world of North Carolina. So many mysteries brought to the foreground in this episode, and many more laid out.[image error]Jamie FraserThe American revolution is in full swing, and Jamie finds himself caught between a loyalty to his king and a betrayal he knows he must make in order to survive the conflict. His knowledge of the events to come have him walking a thin line between honor and treason, and to the shock of his oldest friends and countrymen, his choice will surprise them all.[image error]Claire FraserAnd Claire... OMG Claire has so many life altering events to overcome in this book. I frequently found myself biting my nails down to the quick wondering how the hell she would get out of this story alive, or without permanent scars, both inside and out. But as usual she perseveres with tenacious ferocity as usual. I just love her character... and Bree's.These are some strong women!!!!Brianna Fraser MackenzieThen there is Brianna and Roger... So many traumatic events and shocking revelations... These two are quickly growing into my favorite characters. Their romance in no way shares the passion of Jamie and Claire's but it is showing fantastic potential in doing just that. And the kids.... I love all the kids!!!! Jemmy and especially Germain, Fergus' boy. This whole band of little people had me laughing and crying with joy throughout the book.Roger MackenzieOne of the things I love most about these books is the real-life dramas that continue to plague the characters. I can easily say that even through the explanation of many of the historical events that are occurring at the time, the continuous myriad of changing characters and situations, the medical explanation, and the constantly changing points of view... I never once... not once got bored. There was so much action packed into these thousand pages that I didn't regret a single one. I only have one book left, until the final book next summer, and then I will be sadly mourning my daily dose of Outlander.Diana Gabaldon... I have nothing but the highest of praise and thanks for you in creating these fabulous characters and epic, EPIC stories!!!!The Infamous White Sow!!!Nothing less than5 STARSnow on to book 6... YAY!!!!!
