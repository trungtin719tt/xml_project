The gentle gentleman, William Shakespeare pokes glorious fun at customs, marriages , greed and scoundrels, especially pretentious men and women. .. A practical joke can be carried to the extreme, in the northern Italian city of Padua, in the time of the brilliant Renaissance, a poor intoxicated man ( a tramp in fact), strangely named Christopher Sly, is found by an amused nobleman, outside a filthy tavern, sleeping on the dirt in the street, people walking by ignoring the unfortunate human. Until this Lord has an idea, take him to his impressive mansion and pretend that the lush, is really the owner, exchange identities, the nobleman becomes a servant and Sly, the powerful aristocrat, a long illness had made him think, the dreams of a lowly situation in life, were correct . He awakes in his luxury, a miracle, after so many hard years the diluted man comes to his senses they say, everyone acts like this is the lord of the manor. Thrilled, after some effective persuasion, the truth of this he learns about a beautiful wife ( a boy dressed like a woman), begins ordering his smiling "servants" (barely keeping from laughing out loud), to get liquor of an inferior quality, which is not present, he has to receive a better drink, a costly wine never experienced by him. A troupe of actors arrive on site, to perform (Shakespeare loves a play in a play), the bored, sleepy Christopher , gives permission reluctantly to get this over with, as quickly as possible , he rather go to bed, there is a reason now to do so . The play begins, "The Taming of the Shrew", Baptista Minola, a very wealthy merchant, a widower , in the same city has two pretty , marriageable daughters, the calm, kind , charming Bianca, with many suitors, and her older sister Katherine, who does not have any... her sharp tongue, violent, and combative nature, keeps the frightened men, far far away. The father decrees that Katherine must marry first, causing much turmoil, the very generous dowry of both , still cannot get anyone to come forth, the shrew is too well known in town. Until Petruchio, a rich gentleman from Verona, comes to Padua, he wants more wealth and will marry for it, isn't afraid of difficulties, he has only an eye for the gold. Also the son of a well- to- do nobleman, from Pisa, Lucentio, studying at the famous university here sees Bianca, instant love , but the Katherine problem continues, no hope, he will not give up the prize, his feelings are too strong. Disguises himself as a teacher, Minola needs one for his younger daughter, in order to be near Bianca, under an assumed name of Camibio, the mutual attraction is apparent to all, but the clueless father. Now if the brave or is it the foolish Petruchio, can somehow get Katherine to marry him, everyone will live presumably happily ever after , that is what fairy tales state. Would they mislead the public? An diverting satire not to be taken seriously.
