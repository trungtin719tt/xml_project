Re-read: Dec 13th 2016I cannot tell you guys how much I adore and love this story. Vishous is one of my favourite book boyfriends, he's just so grrrr. I wish I had someone like him on my own. He's so over his head for his love and reading about his past and planned future made me care for him so much. I wished from the start that he didn't had to go through all that and by the end of this story I was really moved.Let me quick say that I don't really care much for his mother, even less for his father. I get that his dad is plain and simply a monster but the fact that his mother cared for him in her own way makes it that much harder to forgive her for all that she did. In the end she does the right thing but for me it was a little too late. She's just a selfish person whi needs to grow up fast! If she really know the creatures she created and lived the lives they do, then she would understand that many things she does are so so wrong on so many levels!Anyway, as far as Jane goes, she awesome. Her character is super cool and she doesn't do all that drama, which I love. She's practical and I appreciate that, you wouldn't believe how much! I think she was a huge reason why the story is so amazing and great and why I can't get enough of it. This is my third re-read and believe me it won't be the last. I love everything about it, from the plot to the wonderful romance and even the bad and sad parts, I love them all.I would definitely recommend the story to all paranormal fans!
