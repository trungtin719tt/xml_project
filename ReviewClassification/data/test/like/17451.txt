Wow! This book! Such a thrilling, keeping-you-hooked type of story! Thank you, Kavita, for recommending (your version of recommending anyway :-P) this book to me.This is such a marvellous piece of writing. The words, the story, the characters... I feel soaked, coated with the amazingness of this work by the author. I feel like if I ever meet the honourable person, I would just bow down in sheer awe...The secondary characters (and there was a spotlight on a squirrel of all things for a short time, too) were so well described and portrayed that I knew them as well as I knew the main characters Eli and Oskar. And what a number of secondary characters and POVs. You saw this world from every angle imaginable, every event recounted, as many interpretations as could be given. And without any interruptions to the overall flow of story that you could have perceived because of all the jumping into the different minds. Virginia. That was one woman that would make your eyes bulge out at her courage and grit and her determination to see her decision out, no matter how chillingly hard it is. That woman is my favorite secondary character from this book.This is one piece of work that handles so many threads of thoughts at once and that too so beautifully that you feel this not-to-be-curbed desire to just meet the author once and know that they are real and this is not the work of some not-so-real person.;-)I loved this book, every bit and piece of it. I loved Eli and Oskar, the secondary characters, the numerous shocks that hit us from out of the blue with no warning whatsover as to what could happen next. This is not a classic book. This book is a world of its own. The ending in particular was absolutely amazing and adrenalin-inducing that I just had to end it or feel as if I was being punished by an unseen force...Ohhhh, the rush I got and am still floating on...&lt;3
