Well THAT was fun. Why. Why did I wait so long to read this series??!Cress. Thorne. Freaking cuteness overload.Yep, I'm going to talk about it because I may or may not have squealed aloud several times while reading this book. They are easily one of my all time favorite ships.Cress herself is just so stinking cute. She's so not like a typical heroine. She's extremely intelligent but is primarily a daydreamer and tends to be swept up in her imagination. Ahem... that sounds familiar. Anywayyyy I love how socially awkward and naive she is to the outside world. And Thorne, who is obviously brother from another mother to Nikolai Lansov (Grisha Trilogy) because they are both so completely snarky, cocky, down right hysterical divas.So if it isn't already completely obvious- I had some major Cress / Thorne feels and their slow burn actually drove me a little nuts with my impatience. I still need so much more... I enjoyed them SO much. They are so similar the characters in Tangled (but different too!)Of course, they tended to take the front seat in this novel but the rest of the characters/storylines were not far behind. This book was definitely action packed and full of fun surprises. Not to mention- the hole left in my heart for Cinder/Kia from book one definitely tugged at me again in this book. Was it resolved? I guess you'll have to see!And Iko! I did not expect her to take on a bigger role in this book - but she easily became one of my favorite characters! Such a pleasant surprise.The world building is still fairly mediocre to me (nothing super unique) but it was more fun just based on the fact that all the fairytales we grew up with are intertwined. I still fail to see how Levana is anything beyond a typical 'evil' villain. I don't feel strongly about her- I'm hoping she gets more complex. Additionally, while some of the other characters aren't as strong as others, their vastly different personalities kept me intrigued. Plus, the plot was just down right fun. The pacing was perfect in this one.Do I recommend this series?Heck yeah I do. So far all three books have been light and fun while still managing to get some pretty strong emotions out of me. It's been a nice change of pace for me - a refreshing break from my average fantasy reads.SOOO here I go to book four- I'm hoping it doesn't disappoint becauseI STILL need so much resolution for my ships!!My Blog~Instagram~Twitter~Etsy
