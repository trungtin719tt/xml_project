I used to joke with my mom (also an avid reader) about Newbery Medal winner books. They may be written at a kid/young-adult reading level and they may have teen main characters, but they are not books that kids like. They tend to be more philosophical than the average teenager. Growing up, I don't think there was ever a Newbery book that I liked or related to.This book fits smack in the center of that Newbery stereotype. As a teen, I would have hated this book. To philosophical with not enough of the normal teen drama I was living and accustomed to. However, reading this book as an adult, I thoroughly enjoyed it.Every once in a while, you find an author that is truly gifted with word choice and the art of story-telling. In this book, there are three stories being told at the same time:1) Salamanca (what a great name) traveling across the United States with her grandparents, following the path her missing mother took when she left2) Salamanca's own memories of her mother and the events that took place before her leaving3) Salamanca telling the story of her friend Phoebe and Phoebe's family and the lunatic.The author weaves these three stories together so perfectly, switching between the stories in a way that is smooth and easy to follow. In some parts of the book, she switched between stories every few paragraphs, but the train of thought of Salamanca was so fluid and well-written, the switching was effortless. I think this is a rare gift in an author.The story is about loss and forgiveness, but the way the story is told, it came across as soothing. Instead of feeling sad, I somehow felt more at peace with myself and the world at the end of the book.Not a book I would ever recommend to a teenager or anyone who likes action or drama. Instead, this is a book for readers who like to ponder the world and how their life fits in with the bigger world picture.4.5 stars.
