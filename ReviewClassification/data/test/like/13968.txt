Cat &amp; Bones, Part II packs a punch and leaves you craving more.The plot moves smoothly, the writing is sharper and wittier than the first book, there is oodles of action, the love scenes left me shaking. Literally. The author writes a particular love scene that is very original and hotter than Hades.I've never read anything like it before!Kudos to Jeaniene Frost for taking a chance and starting this book four years later. Most books in a sequel take place one right on top of the other, but this worked for me. Mostly in part because Cat has spent the last four years as a federal agent, training her own speciailized team of vampire killers for a little known branch of Homeland Security. I was thankful I wasn't forced to read all the boring details. Don't get me wrong - the guys on Cat's team are funny, interesting characters who I hope to read about again in the near future. They prove their loyalty to Cat over and over again. But I read these books for one reason and one reason only: Bones. Any page with Bones on it is aVery Good Page.Cat has also spent the past four years trying to adjust to her life without Bones. Unsuccessfully. When attending her best friend's wedding, she runs into an unexpected guest and is reunited with a member of the wedding party. Things heat up almost immediately. Suddenly there are several attemps on Cat's life from both the dead and the undead world. She is forced to trust Bones again as he searches to find the person who placed a hit on his beloved's head. During the process some interesting facts present themself regarding Cat's heritage.I missed Cat as I met her in the first book - sweeter, funnier with the one-liners, a little more naive'. Now she is bitchier, tougher and drinks and curses more than the first book. I found her jealousy of Bone's former lover, Annette, to be downright funny, but then again it led to thehottest love scene everso the end justified the means. I just hope that in the next book I can be convinced she deserves the awesomeness that is Bones. If it doesn't work out, then as Gena Showalter so wisely said, "Marry me Bones!"
