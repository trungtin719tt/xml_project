This is an excerpt from my review of Inferno, which I read before Angels and Demons -With this glowing rating for Inferno, I seal my place among the cheap thrill seeking, easy going, instant gratification demanding readers. I welcome that the other Robert Langdon books follow the same tired schema.Now then, it felt to me that most of the book was not living to this sugary craving of pulp literature. This brought me back to earth, when I was once airborne. However the book picked up for a fiery, flowery third act. By the end I was sweating bullets. But the book is one of the best big books to sustain the ideas and keep providing mini theatricals. It's a wonder how the writer could assimilate all these research and documentation and merge it in a thriller of a bestseller. For that alone I applaud Dan Brown.
