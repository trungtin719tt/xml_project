I didn't like this one as much as the first book (there's just not enough Gilbert, am I right?) but I definitely enjoyed continuing this adventure with Anne. There are so many new characters in this one but, unfortunately, I didn't seem to love all of them. The writing stays just as beautiful as it was in the first book. Also, that last paragraph.Be still my beating heart.Can't wait to start Anne of the Island!
