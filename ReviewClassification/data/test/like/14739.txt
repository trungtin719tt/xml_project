Forget Mystic River. Shutter Island is the Dennis Lehane book to read. Set in the mid 1950's on a secluded island that serves as a mental institution for the criminally insane, Shutter Island combines elements of psycho-drama and horror with a good mystery and well-rounded characters. U.S. Marshals Daniels and Aule come to the island to investigate the mysterious escape of a violent patient from the hospital, only to be trapped on the island by the worst hurricane in thirty years. The two Marshals stumble onto a government conspiracy in mind control and HUAC plots raging out of control. Quick paced, exciting and thoughtful, with well established characters, Shutter Island is one any mystery fan would love.NC
