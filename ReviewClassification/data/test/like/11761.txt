I read this long time ago but even now I can still visualise this book it slow dark grasping atmosphere .If never read it you enjoy it's autobiographical description &amp; this came out long before Shawshank or the Green mile .I was only 15 when read this &amp; it's sequal Banko it is like Swing Hammer Swing by Jeffrey Torrington or Angles Ashes.The Dustin Hoffman &amp; Steve McQueen movie was not bad too.But like Q &amp; A which end up as Slumdog Millionaire this book is much better.
