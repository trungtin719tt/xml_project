What can I say about thisEugene Onegin? A work that is so sublime, bearing the name of a character, oh so much apart... I would like to thank the magnificence of this song with my simple words, and I feel immediately this will be a daunting task... But I start anyway!Let's talk first about intrigue.Eugene Oneguinis a love story between Onegin and Tatiana, a love story obviously impossible - even though here it is rather rendered impossible and lost forever because of the blindness and contempt of Onegin, a jaded character and tired by all that constitutes life, especially by men and especially love. The whole is punctuated by the intervention of the poetPushkin, who delivers us with delight his trait of spirit.Through this novel we also make a magnificent encounter, that of the touching and tender Lenski, a young romantic poet who responds only to the voice of the heart, and are indeed on the same path - the very one that will make him losing his precious life for Love. He thus appears as an anti-Onegin in his loving effusions and his faith in life, and his sacrifice makes him a splendid hero.Anna Netrebko - Eugene Oneguin - in the Met - New YorkIn terms of form - please, do not miss so much beauty - I found writing verse just divine, and I could not resist the urge to read in high voices this extraordinary song we offer Pushkin, the Great Alexander Pushkin..In short, I loved this novel, which, for me, is nothing but a masterpiece of literature, both Russian and global.
