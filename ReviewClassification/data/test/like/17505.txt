This is a great book. I can relate in a lot of ways and it was very hard to see it in black and white. The abuse is very difficult to read. But I felt like I must get through it. The book has so much feeling and honesty. This author took a leap of faith by telling her story. She is very brave, that which most of us be too scary to even think of how many children this is happening today. Great book if you can handle the triggers and want to see some hope in the future.
