The fathers may soar...And the children may know their names...What a book! What an incredible journey! I cannot possibly review this book; it has me completely speechless! What a pleasure to partake in Milkman's journey, to be introduced to characters like Pilate, and to be reminded that onecanfly if only one tries enough! This is my first African American and Morrison novel, and I'm so glad we'll be doing her next semester! Ecstatic and eager to fish out gems from this novel! Only hope the instructor doesn't take the fun away. :\O Sugarman done fly away...Sugarman done gone...Sugarman cut across the sky...Sugarman gone home...
