These are Just some of but not all of my descriptions of this book. Whatever I write in my review it will not give this book justice, I know that this story has buried itself in my heart and it's there to stay. Every moment of this book was pure undiluted writing genius and I've added myself to the long line of readers that fell in complete book love with this story. Here are my starry-eyed albeit insufficient 'The sea of Tranquility' book thoughts ...What's it all about?Nastya Kashnikov is living a second life of heartache, pain and intolerable memories, one tragic incident, one moment of time robbed her of the bright, happy girl she once was. This broken girl just wants to live her life and attempt to hide her secrets from those around her. Josh Bennett has had more than his fair share of loss and heartbreak, left all alone at the young age of seventeen this young man wants nothing more than to be left to move forward. When Josh and Nastya's lives collide so begins the journey of redemption, healing, friendship, and love and ultimately the story of one tragically beautiful girl and one solitary boy who find each other amongst the pain of their own difficulties.What did I love?There are not enough stars or descriptive comments than can sum up this novel and it's tragic perfection. I felt so immersed in this story everything about it grabbed all of my emotions. Every single character had their place and purpose, the writing was flawless and the dialogue was enchanting. The whole entire book was highlight-worthy and addictive, when I wasn't reading the story I was thinking about it and when I was reading I could not think about anything else. This story has crawled into my soul and has decided to take up permanent residency there, the characters were outlandishly good and the plot was extraordinary. I don't think I can put into words the talent that this author has poured into her work. Everything about this book made me respond with heartbreaking emotions, the author wrote in such a way that demanded that I felt every conceivable emotion during the story that she was creating. Josh and Sunshine are the ultimate in young adult characters, I felt like I had ring side tickets to their journey towards redemption. Everything about them and their lives had me glued to the pages, I fell in love with the both of them as the story progressed. I can't go without mentioning Drew his friendship and loyalty stood out for me as a winning combination in this story, I loved that the author created characters that all fitted so perfectly together and I know that future books will have a difficult time topping the admiration that I have for them all. Ultimately if you are an admirer of this genre and have not read this story then I urge you to do so. I can guarantee that this novel will break you to pieces and then fix you up better than you were before.Final thoughts ...It's been days since I have finished this book and I'm still not able to shake the thoughts and emotions from finishing a novel of such amazing depths. This has to be crowned as a favourite, there is nothing that I enjoy more than being swept away by the work of an author and I know with a certainty that these characters will stay in my heart forever. I urge those that have not read this book to go grab it, it has my heart I want it to gain yours too. Enjoy, kisses.*A special thank you to my girls who endured, my never ending texts, sobbing voice messages and endless hand holding ... Love you Christy, Anna 'Philly poppet' Champion and MrsH*
