Roland continues with his quest for The Dark Tower. While he was alone at first, he decides to have some company. He decides to have a drawing of the three. Three more people to be involved in his obsessive quest for the tower. Will he compromise the lives of the chosen ones, or will he make them better? The amazing quest continues in this second installment of the series.Once again King introduced amazing characters. Right from the start I knew I was going to like Eddie Dean. He was this drug dealer who wasunluckyenough to be chosen by The Gunslinger. He was not as difficult as Roland thought he would be. Honestly I'm shocked that he didn't feel weird about someone talking inside his head. The mere fact that paranormal things were happening and he didn't freak out made him a bit cooler than he already was. The plane scene and the one with Balazar are some of the few unforgettable scenes in this novel involving Eddie. Even his life story with his brother Henry was a really fun thing to read. I can't wait to read more of him in the next novels. There is something about drug dealers that aren't that cocky that I really seem to like. I guess they seem more realistic than drastically flawless characters. Eddie was flawed, but so was The Gunslinger. I think most people would agree that flawed characters are way better than the perfect ones.Odetta Holmes was my second least favorite of the 4 main characters in this novel. She had no legs, but she was described as this sweet lady. Or maybe Detta Holmes was my second least favorite? Detta was this evil character that kept complaining and finding ways to make sure the quest would end up a failure. I'm rooting for Roland to succeed, so Detta was a pain in the ass. I didn't like her that much, but not enough to hate her. Jack Mort was my least favorite of them all. He was undeveloped in the end, and it felt like King didn't really make him likeable at all. He had the least appearances, so there was no room to like him. He wasn't unlikeable, but not enough information were given for him to be likeable. I guess this is my only complaint regarding the novel.The plot was mainly about Roland discovering about contemporary America. His world was so different from ours that he was so confused about everything. It was fun reading about his struggles. Aside from the struggles though, it was even better reading about the way Roland managed to perform the "drawing of the three". It just further proved how amazing of an epic this is turning out to be. It's a mixture of Fantasy and Sci-Fi, and that was what King promised. It was more than adequate to satisfy my Fantasy/epic needs. While King will always be regarded as the king of horror, this series just proves that he can do so much more. In short, King is an amazing writer.The opening scene, or also known as the lobster scene, will always be remembered. Perfect way to begin the novel.5/5 stars and will definitely be one of my rereads in the future. I haven't even finished the series yet but I'm tempted to read the first book again already. This second novel was really great, and it makes me even want to finish the series already, so that I could reread it all over again, multiple times.
