One of the great things about having a inter cold (even in L.A.) is that you can spend a day in bed with a great book. That was my experience yesterday when I finished TO LIVE AND DIE IN fantasyLAnd. It was a great read, and dealt with Shawn Michals/Rusty Loury/Ben Peller's final chapter in a journey that's been oftentimes hilarious as well as challenging. This book introduces Bina, a mysterious and powerful woman who holds a command over "Shawn" as he weaves in and out of fantasy on an island that demands political and social change. The book is sometimes as mysterious as its characters, and in the end it promises hope, evolution, and revolution. Who could ask for anything more? I'm going to reread this sucker over Christmas. Happy Holidays everyone!
