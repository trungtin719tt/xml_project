On a blistering summer's day in the suburbs of Tucson, Arizona, a normal aging housewife walks away from her empty nest, glances up at the house where she knows her husband is having an affair with some other housewife, and steps into the Sonoran Desert to die. She figures it ought to be easy. "Primitive" people do it. It's hot. Find a nice rock and drift away. Things don't go as Mrs. Warren thinks they should. It's not easy to die. It's scary. It's uncomfortable. Lying around on a rock, some bug could bite you. It doesn't take long to figure this isn't a good idea. So back to her daytime soaps, one kid in college "majoring in greed", the other risking her life on the mean streets of LA, her Valium and her loneliness. But where is "back"? Mrs. Warren wasn't paying attention when she walked straight into the hot hot hot dry thorny desert. She's lost. She can't just walk back. Her cell needs charging. She's in real trouble here. And therein begins a wonderful crispy written (not a word our of place) novel of survival. Not the survival of a adventurer or a man who knows how to handle the wild but crashed his airplane or got his arm stuck between rocks. The survival of a woman who's just had her hair done, who doesn't know anything about feeding herself outside her supermarket or a good restaurant. It's a unexpected story, a touching story, a freeing story. It's a story I will read again. And again.
