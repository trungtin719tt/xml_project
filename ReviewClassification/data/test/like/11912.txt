A must read each day. Hope for the helpless and those willing to do what is right no matter what the challenge. Writing by individuals and church representatives anciently who were willing to live by the higher law (charity, not just Moses' 10 commandments: an eye for an eye; equal justice). I memorized the Beatitudes as a member of my Baptist Church's 66 club (66 books in the Bible ... join by memorizing the books' names, stay a member by memorizing scriptures.) And love to read about the same sermon given to descendants of those who fled Jerusalem before it feel. So nice to have a volume of books by those who successfully sufficiently sacrificed and grew to learn more of God's eternal plan.
