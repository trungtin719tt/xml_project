This book was one of the best books ever written, according to me. It is made up of three different books. The first book, Secret Vampire, was really good. It was mostly about how a girl nicknamed poppy was dying of pancreatic cancer. Her best friend, James, a born vampire turned her into a vampire in order to save her. At first Poppy's twin brother,Phil, didn't like the idea. He convinced Poppy that James was a monster and that she shoukld stay away from him. I really hated him then. I coukldn't believe that he preferred his sister to die insted of becoming a vampire. But at the end of the story he agreed. I found out that Poppy and Phil were witches from their father's side of the family.The second book was Daughters of Darkness. It was good but it was my least favorite. It was about three vampire sisters that escaped from their home to go to live with their grandmother. While their the younger sister fell in love with a human neighbor named Mark. The vampires' brother, Ash, came to take them back. He fell in love with Mark's older sister Mary-Lynette.The last book, Spellbinder, was my favorite of them all. It was about how a witch named Thea fell in love witha human named Eric. Her cousin, Blaise, wanted to make Eric her boy toy. She makes potion so she could seduce them into doing really stupid and dangerous stuff. Once she made a boy burn down a whole school. At the end of the book Blaise tricked the adults into thinking that Thea and Eric forgot everything about magic an the Night World.
