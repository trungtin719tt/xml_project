H.P Lovecraft has to be one of my favorite authors ever, though not for the reasons one might assume. His writing is purposefully archaic, and many of his characters lack any real dimension. The plots of his stories are simplistic and highly predictable, almost formulaic: step one, someone finds something scary. Step two, that someone gets scared. Step three, that someone either dies or goes insane (or both). Many of his stories are blatantly racist and xenophobic, and in his more popular works, an inherent fear of other races is required to share the paranoia the author so desperately tries to instill in the reader.Ironically, it is this excessive paranoia that makes H.P Lovecraft such an amazing horror author. He was a hateful little shrew, and would have been an absolute nightmare to deal with in person, because he was fearful and suspicious of everyone and everything that wasn't alike to him (among many reasons). Authors seldom confine themselves to writing about the things they know, but fear was Lovecraft's companion throughout his entire life, more specifically fear of the unknown. Horror authors constantly strive to scare their readers, but who can do it better than someone who's afraid of everything?Of course, the things H.P Lovecraft feared the most aren't all that terrifying to the modern reader, but I have been scared and apprehensive reading his stories, if only by living vicariously through the narrator. Lovecraft could probably make me deathly afraid of a bunch of bananas, if the fear they inspired in the narrator was as well conveyed and genuine as in his others.
