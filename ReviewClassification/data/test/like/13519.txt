I'm sticking with my original rating on this one. I enjoyed reading it again. Unfortunately, my students didn't seem to connect to it. The translation I remember reading as a student was much better--the one in our anthology is very complex and takes away from the simplicity of the Greek language. The ideas become lost in "thees" and "thous." I don't know why the translator felt the need to mimic Shakespeare. However, my students wrote very interesting and (some) nuanced responses to my questions about Anitgone, Ismene, Creon, and Haemon. Maybe they're getting more out of it than they think or want to :)My appreciation for this play lies in an interest in Ancient Greek literature and culture but also in the play's language and ideas. I love the conflict between Antigone and Creon, the conflict of "heaven's laws" versus the state. Being a woman of faith myself, I can appreciate Antigone's desire to bury her brother according to the gods' rituals even though it means disobeying her uncle, King Creon, who imposes the law that anyone who buries Polyneices will die. Antigone chooses a noble and honorable death doing something she believes in over life in subservience to a king that she can't fully respect. I also appreciate the topics of fate and wisdom--the end theme as I understand it is that only by wisdom (acceptance, in this case) can we be comfortable with Fate, who does what she wants without regard to person. If we constantly fight against Fate, against the gods, we will always struggle. If we accept their ways and allow what happens to happen, we are wise and will find happiness and peace. It's an interesting concept to convey through this "ill-starred" family (Antigone is, of course, the famed Oedipus' daughter, which means that her mother is also her grandmother, and that all her siblings are also her cousins; my students liked this part...).I highly recommend this play, but it makes the most sense in context, so read Oedipus Rex first and Oedipus at Colonus next, if you can, before you read this one.
