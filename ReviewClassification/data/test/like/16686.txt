4.5 StarsI want to cry my eyes out, throw this book across the room, and hug Maas. This was nuts.------ MILD SPOILERS BELOW (nothing big)------I am completely wrecked but in the best possible way. This book was astounding- so many amazing moments.I do have complaints that I'll explain out below*cough, mush scenes*- but overall, this series is one hell of an emotional rollercoaster and that most definitely continues here. By the way...I've decided this book is basically what were to happen if the Avenger and LOTR had a love child.This picks up immediately after Queen of Shadows- Aelin has left King Dorian and Adarlan behind so that she can reclaim Terassen. Only, the lords that still exist there have decided she is not fit for the throne - regardless of the fact that the world is going to hell and someone needs to fight. She is forced back out of her home and decides that regardless, she will gather an army and protect her home. She vows to make an army of thieves and commoners - and call in old favors. (Definitely read the novellas before diving into this book!)First off, the first 45% of this book is so much fun. Why? Yes, Aelin's journey is special, but mostly because of the new characters!We have Elide on the run to Terassan to find Aelin.. but Lorcan is stalking her. Dorian was left in Adarlan but of course, we find out he's about to be attacked. By who? Witches. Guess what witch shows up? Oh hell to the yes. Guess who else shows up? You'll have to see. Guess who is bugging the ever living crap out of our dearest Aedion? Lysandra. And no matter what he says, he likes it. So yes.. new relationships.. oh what a wonderful web of personalities.And thefight scenes? Bloody hell are they epic. Not only that, but we have several returning characters AND locations from the novellas that bring back some serious nostalgia.THE CHARACTERSAelin herselfGood lord. She surprised me so many times in this book. First of all, when the lords rejected her as queen - I thought she was going to lose it. But she didn't. She was a queen in heart - and her words back to them gave me chills. After that though, she began to drive me a little crazy. She's just as snarky and secretive as she's always been, and I found myself getting a little frustrated with her. Now, I'm sorry I ever judged her. She's absolutely the most selfless person in this entire series - Dorian close behind her. You won't know why until you finish this book... but good heavens, this girl. I actually cried over the insane, heart-wrenching ending of this book. Don't even try to guess what happens. Don't even try.Additionally, I've never been more thankful that she knows how to tell someone off and get on people's nerves. Trust me.. it is well deserved for some of the villains. No one can rattle them like she can.Lastly, her story just really gets me. This girl knows pain like the back of her hand.. and Maas knows how to write that. Aelin's development throughout this series is riveting. It hits me on a personal level. I get so emotional thinking about who she is now. I would just warn you to be careful before judging her too harshly because you never know what she really has up her sleeve.Rowan + Aelin relationshipI love them both individually and together - butI found myself not caring about their mushy scenes together, AT ALL.Yes, yes they were cute at times but I think the other characters overshadowed them so I was more excited for other POVs. I just didn't care about their togetherness. They lost the spark for me.LysandraA new favorite character, hands down. Not even just because of her snarky little relationship with Aedion - she bas become all sorts of badass. I LOVE HER.ManonOH. MY. HEAVENS. THIS. GIRL. You thought she was cool before? I was floored by her. Floored. I have never loved her more. And boy did she scare the hell out of me more than once.DorianI think a lot of people are upset that he's a King now but doesn't seem to have a lot of say around Aelin. I think it is more because he's having to heal and regain himself after what happened in book 4. He's still totally awesome and a little cinnamon roll - though he's a bit more devious than I initially thought. Dang.AedionStill my brother from another mother. Precious. Loves to rattle Aelin. Someone's got to.Lorcan / ElideHOOOOboy. Not what I expected. Totally unpredictable and complex... BOTH of them. I loved their dynamic and their POVs so much. I did not expect them to take a front seat in this novel but it was awesome.ChaolYes, yes- due to spoilers - most people know that he's not in this book. Yes he's a favorite of mine and always will be. But you know what? It makes sense that he isn't in this book.It is very obvious that he is coming back.He has to go HEAL and he's gathering an army. I see why Maas made this decision and it was never to brush him off. I'm willing to bet he's going to play a big role in the next book. Either way? He's her character - and I think its kinda sad people are saying Maas got tired of him b/c of Rowan. Really guys? The series isn't done yet -and he's getting his own novella for the time missing. Have you even heard her talk about him? She adores him.***UPDATE... Oh wait, yes he is in the book. He's got a special little short story- check out Cait's review for the link! (bottom)The VillainsThis is what I was most excited about because if a book doesn't have good/convincing/chilling villains, I always seem to fall disinterested. First of all, we have Erawan who we finally see for his true self. Total Lord of the Rings vibe. I had chills. He's going to be so legit as a villain- but he's still being developed. Then Maeve... I did NOT see what she had up her sleeve coming and holy hell. Both of them are more complex than you can imagine.THE OVERALL PLOTI had a ton of fun going through it. After the first half of the book - it seemed to drag a little bit and I found myself getting a little disappointed - but I think it was because of the jet lag after the first big of craziness. That being said- it wasn't long before things started to pick up again and OH MY STARS the last 20% of the book.... I have no words other than it completely destroyed me. But SO good... so epic. Okay yes- some people are saying this book has a few ACOMAF vibes to it. It is true, but at the same time- the storyline is so different that I don't care one bit. Either way, this series is so fun that the flaws don't bother me. This book shook me up so much by the end that I still haven't picked up another book yet and it's been a few days.Also, I honestly hope you all stop judging this by mere spoilers because it won't do it justice at all. Writing a few notes on what happened won't even scratch the surface. I've said it before but Maas just isn't the author for everyone- but I would just be careful to pass judgments with just the spoilers.Other things to look forward to?Rowan/Dorian friendshipELENA POV (HELL YES)Deeper understanding of the pastHuge plot twistOMGISJ:LSJKDF ABRAXOS IS AMAZING AND I LOVE HIM AND NEED HIM IN MY LIFE.The return of characters/locations from the novellaA TV SHOW!!!THE STEAMY SCENESYes, there is a warning for mature content on this book (thank you publishers for not throwing people in blindly.)Honestly this is my biggest complaint for the book. They only detracted from the story. They were completely unnecessary to the plot.I almost removed a star for this, BUT thankfully, theycan be easily skipped. If you'd like to know the page numbers for them - just message me and I'll give you a heads up if you prefer not to read them (orCait's review has the page numbers and is linked below).Also, I don't love how Maas describes everyone being so "attractive" BUT she makes fun of herself on that note. A particularly favorite moment of mine is when Manon is on Aelin's ship for a time and Aedion welcomes her by saying something like "Oh, you'll fit in fine here. There's an ungodly amount of attractive people on this ship."I'm also aware of the diversity issues of this series and I think its terribly sad the way some of it was executed. I'm hoping most of it was unintentional and that Sarah will be much more intentional in future books.Last notesOnce this book has been out for a while- I'll probably write a bit more on my thoughts towards the ending and more - as well as pulling in some quotes. Overall, this series epic and... insane.*SeeCait's Reviewfor lots of additional information on this book including the short stories/bonuses!*And for a blog post containing some of the awesome fan art- check my blog below*AAAND I'm still not OK after this book sooo lets chat if you feel the same.SOUNDTRACK!I made aTOG playlistSome of my favorites are:-Bleed for me by Digital Daggers(This is 100% Aelin)-The Leftovers by Johan Agebjorn(I get chills - total Erawan vibes)-The songs byGareth Coker- guys his album "Ori and the Blind Forest" could legit be the soundtrack/theme for this entire series. Not gonna lie- I'm lame enough that I totally had it on repeat while I read this entire series and now it makes me emotional.Check out the TOG playlist HEREI also made fireheart bookmarks (see my etsy link below!)My Blog~Instagram~Twitter~Etsy
