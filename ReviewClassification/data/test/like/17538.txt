I just finished a review ofThe Witching Hourand was reminded of my intense love forMemnoch the Devil. I never got around to writing anything about this book, so here we go.Memnoch the Devil was the first of Anne Rice's books that I had read, following her autobiography which I read for a class, and I was blown away. It was so different from what I expected from the author of "those vampire books," and perhaps that is the reason for many of the negative reviews here on Goodreads. Having gone back and read the rest of The Vampire Chronicles, I can say that Memnoch certainly is a departure from these stories. It is a world in it's own. At the same time, it is a perfect continuation and culmination of Lestat's struggle to understand purpose and existence.The story does take a while in getting to the heart of the matter, which is Lestat's conversation with the devil and tour of heaven/hell, but once you get there, the story is completely absorbing. Rice almost achieves a new theology that is entirely persuasive by giving the account of creation from the devil's perspective. I agree that this should have been the end of the chronicles. The final chapter is heartbreakingly beautiful.
