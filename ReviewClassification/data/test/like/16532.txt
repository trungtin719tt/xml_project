Wizard and Glass.What do I even say about this book?This book is an immense, epic, beautifully told story of love and loss.If you are reading this, you are most likely aware thatWizard and Glassis the fourth installment in Stephen King's epic fantasy series,The Dark Tower.In this book we hear an incredible tale of the early life of Roland of Gilead.We learn all about his life shortly after becoming a Gunslinger. He has been sent from home to the Barony of Mejis with two of his closest companions, Alain and Cuthbert, in order to keep him safe from the sinister Marten Broadcloak.The boys settle in Hambry and there they encounter a ruthless and shady cast of characters, such as the Big Coffin Hunters, Mayor Thorin and my favorite witch, Rhea of Coos.The main story, however, involves Roland meeting his true love, Susan Delgado, focusing on their budding and blossoming relationship.The intricacy within this story, within this world, is absolutely amazing.King is the master of character development and this story is no different.While reading this book I truly felt like I could see everything playing out before me like a movie.This book is completely different from the other books in the series that I have read. I am absolutely in love with it.Spellbinding from beginning to endand I feel more attached to Roland now than ever before!Excited to move on with my journey to the Tower.
