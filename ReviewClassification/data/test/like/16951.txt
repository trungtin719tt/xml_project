So......I finally read this.....enjoyed it. I found myself comparing this book to a new family TV series with Eugene Levy called 'Schitt's Creek'. The most entertaining-FUNNY show, I've seen in years.The dialogue is hilarious in both 'White Noise' and 'Schitt's Creek' between the parents and kids.Jack Gladney's friend, Murray cracked me up! He reminded me of one of the characters on 'Schitt's Creek'.Most of this book was comical to me.From the beginning--I was shaking my head...."What? REALLY? Jack has been married 4 'times'? What woman in their right mind would marry a man who has been married 3 times before her? Jack's wife, Babette, had to be a little bonkers to marry Jack. Reading for the blind was a perfect job for her - she could relate to blindness - first hand.It was also funny that Jack worried about not being able the speak German even though he created a special program at the college where he teaches on Hitler studies.Funny lines -- page after page. Did I read this book right? Was it ok to laugh as much as I did?? I mean I know there seemed to be so much fear of death....but somehow... I found it more comical - than serious.I thought it was an easy FUN READ.... a 'mild' satire... fear of death, digital frontier justice, capitalism- capitalist bashing in sorts....consumerism....Love the wise-ass - savvy hip kids...Preposterous Fun!DeLillo professionals?..... did I read it wrong?
