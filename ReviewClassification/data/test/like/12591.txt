My friend Lauren read this to her elementary school kids last year -one day she read it to them aloud for an hour and a half! This is especially remarkable considering the usual behavior of her students (which is NOT sitting still, listening, and engaging in meaningful ways).The story is well told in the ten-year old main character's voice. I'm sure this makes it attractive and understandable to young readers (or listeners). And easy for them to relate to.The book does a good job of opening up the topic of feeling sad due to difficult life experiences, while at the same time modeling how life can be bearable despite sad events, and not just bearable butgood!I enjoyed the story and appreciated the meaningful concepts told in simple terms.And Lauren- I'm wondering if it was while reading this that you put your prejudices aside and began to warm up to Sadie? :)A favorite part: (and I don't think it's because of my bad eyesight.)(Opal's friend Gloria Dump says to her) "You know, my eyes ain't too good at all. I can't see nothing but the general shape of things, so I got to rely on my heart. Why don't you go on and tell me everything about yourself, so as I can see you with my heart."(and a few pages later, Opal narrates) "I could feel her listening with all her heart, and it felt good."
