The Forgotten Gardenis a multi-generational mystery that reveals itself bit by haunting bit, featuring three women:- Eliza, born in the late 1800s, who is born into poverty in London. Eliza's mother was a young woman who had run away from her upper crust home, for reasons that become clear later in the story, but she is found and pulled back into her wealthy family's embrace (or maybe it's their tentacles).- Nell, born in 1909, who is found sitting on her suitcase on an Australian ship dock in 1913, adamantly refusing to say where she came from or even what her name is. Eventually she begins searching for her roots in England.- Cassandra, Nell's Australian granddaughter, who takes up the search in England after Nell dies.The storyline skips back and forth in time and from person to person (and also tosses in a few other characters' POVs here and there for good measure, which might irk you if you prefer a more linear plotline with a single POV). But the concerns of these characters and the themes of this book - like identity, finding oneself, family connections, desires - are so closely tied together that I didn't feel confused once I got to know the characters.Eliza is an author of mystical and sometimes dark fairy tales, with lovely sketched illustrations by another character. I really wanted to see these illustrations; I imagine them as something like an Arthur Rackham illustration:Some of Eliza's stories find their way into the text of this book, and their symbolism and autobiographical qualities help to unravel the mystery of Eliza's life and how it connects to Nell's and Cassandra's. Toward the end I was able to guess the main mysteries of the book, but at least they didn't come out of left field.There are some nasty and disturbed characters in this book and a few really ill-advised decisions made by characters who are otherwise likeable, so it's not all rainbows and unicorns here. In the end it's a bittersweet but hopeful story, and overall I enjoyed the book.
