Everyone can experience hardship in life and it comes in a number of forms and it can be so difficult to free yourself from it. Dwelling on pain or grief is so much easier than finding a way to move forward, but if you don't do so you will be missing out on all the wonderful joys life has to offer. 'Finding Hope in the Darkness of Grief' by Diamante Lavendar is a wonderful collection of poetry, prose and art, which helps you to look at your situation differently and encouraging you to find hope within yourself. It is insightful, spiritual, and deeply healing if you open yourself up to the lessons that can be learned in all moments of life. Moving, uplifting, and a great book to keep coming back to when you have had a difficult day, and need to find a moment of peace.
