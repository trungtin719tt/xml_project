I own 19 physical copies by Rick Riordan and out of the 16 I've read, none have disappointed me. And the same can be said about this one. No idea why this series has such a low rating because I for one adored this book!! The Egyptian mythology is just as interesting as the Greek and Norse he brought us near and proves that a) not only is Rick an unprejudiced sort of character, he also has a vast knowledge of other mythologies and manages to capture the essence of said mythologies in his stories. Well done as always :)
