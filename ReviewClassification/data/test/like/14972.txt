Not so much a book as a life experience, Pat Conroy's Beach Music covers a heck of a lot of topics. Like his other titles this one has family and friendship are the forefront but the scope of this novel was vast covering alcoholism, suicide, schizophrenia, domestic violence, religion, the holocaust, the vietnam war, politics, trust, sickness, survival, and love in all shapes and sizes. He so thoroughly tackles each topic it sometimes felt like he'd written several books in one.Primarily set in Waterford, South Carolina, Beach Music is a family saga of epic proportions. From the very first sentence of the Prologue we learnt Jacks' wife Shyla suicided leaving him to raise their 2 year old daughter Leah. Shyla leapt to her death and was swept away just as we readers were swept into the drama of this magnificent book. Beach Music was a tribute to Shyla, to Southern families of all shapes and sizes, to enduring friendships and to reconciliation. As Jack leads us through his personal history and those of extended family, of friends and their families, the stories creep into progressively more difficult territory. Recollections of domestic violence within his own home and that of his friend Jordan. From his mothers desperately difficult redneck start to life, he progressed to sharing his in-laws experiences as European Jews. With entire chapters dedicated to the atrocities and horrors of WWII this made for horrendous reading. Jack recalls his experiences of resisting the Vietnam war, highlighting the divisiveness caused within American society, amongst family and friends, the strength of opinion and lengths people went to express their beliefs. Of course these are just some of the bigger topics and not all were gloom and doom. There were stories of flourishing friendships showing how trust was built as big and small life experiences were shared. There were stories of brotherly love, albeit expressed with sarcasm, humour and gruffness. The way those same brothers learnt to express their love in both words and deeds for their dying mum. There was the passing of the baton from grandmother to granddaughter for the care and protection of the loggerhead turtles. There was the delightful relationship between Jack and daughter Leah, and the stories of the Great dog Chippie. There was an element of intrigue as we waited to find out what had caused an irreparable rift between previously firm friends, and so the list goes on. As I sit and try to catalogue the high's and lows the list is long. For me, the the icing on the cake was the way it caused tears of both sadness and joy, and the fact that I never once tired of this book of almost 800 pages.As always Pat Conroy's writing was delicious, insightful and full of meaning. He's skilled at creating characters that step off the page, into your life and linger in your memory. But above all of this he is a master in the art of telling a story. I have a hunch these words (p249) attributed to Jack actually describe Pat Conroy himself."We told stories to each other, and my brothers, like me, mark time by cherishing the details that stud the layers of each great story. They were Southern boys and they knew how to make a story sizzle when it hit the fat". Thank you Pat Conroy, your story most definitely sizzled throughout and it made me cherish the details.
