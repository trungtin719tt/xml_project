Okay, everyone has now expressed how infuriated they are that there is a fourth book to this series, now I am going to put in my opinion. Yes, I am ecstatic, in fact it is taking a lot of physical restrain to type this in but, by god, when I realized that there was a fourth book I screamed so loud I think my neighbours have call the police. Of course I found out about 3 minutes after finishing Silence so I was very deflated that the book had ended like that with so many gaps and questions but I knew it was the end. So imagine my relief when I found out it wasn't.OKAY I CANT HOLD IT IN ANY LONGER I AM BURSTING WITH JOY! YES!! YES!! YES!! YES!! YES!! YES!!Okay, I am going to leave on that note.
