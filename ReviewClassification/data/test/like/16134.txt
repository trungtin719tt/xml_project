This was my first Chuck Palahniuk book and I am pleasantly surprised at how much liked it. He has a very unique writing style that I found simplistic, yet very profound in meaning within the situation. The whole story is very out-there, but not so much that it seems unrealistic while in the story. The characters were really strange and not really likable. They were intriguing though, so it didn't dissuade me from wanting to know what was going to happen.I don't know what else to say. It's just a really good, unique book.
