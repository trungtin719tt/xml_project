3.5 rounded up.People hide the truth because they're afraidMy second time reading Safe Haven, the first half was a bit slow. We don't know about Katie's past yet, and we simply follow the beginnings of her settling into the small town of Southport and starting a relationship with Alex - the local general store owner.As her background is slowly revealed, I began to fear for her. That this new life she made for herself could be taken away at any moment. The final part of the book is drama filled(view spoiler)[ Katie's/Erin's psycho abusive ex husband tracks her down and attempts to burn the house and shop down with Alex's kids and Katie inside! He is an awful human being, and the chapters which show us his thought processes are truly frightening. He genuinely doesn't see that his behaviour is wrong, something seriously fucked up in his brain(hide spoiler)]I also appreciated the twist with her neighbour(view spoiler)[ turns out she isn't actually real - she is Alex's dead wife visiting Katie in spirit form(hide spoiler)]very random and I did not see that coming.Overall, nothing revolutionary, but it was enjoyable and as Sparks' novels go, it had a nice ending rather than a soul destroying one. :)I'm not sure anyone's life turns out exactly the way they imagine. All we can do is try to make the best of it. Even when it seems impossible.
