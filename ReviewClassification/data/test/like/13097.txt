I'm glad I finally read this! I'd seen the movie before so this story wasn't new but I still enjoyed it. Brashares did a great job of creating real teenage emotions. The turmoil and depression these girls all went through during this summer jumped of the pages and felt very true to how I remember myself feeling at that time in my life. Each of the girls is so different, but I can see a bit of myself in most of them so there were many different moments in each story line that I related to.However, while the characters were the star of the show, I wasn't a big fan of the format or writing rhythm. There was no real rhyme or reason to when chapter breaks or POV changes occurred and I guess I've just been spoiled by how books likePretty Little Liarshave handled 4 character POVs. Additionally, I felt that most sentences were similar in length and very straightforward. Could have used a little more description or development of some of the themes. The character reactions were amazing, but I would have liked a little more time spent on WHY they were reacting the way they were. Things seemed to come on very suddenly and then be over.That didn't take away from my overall enjoyment very much though! I recognize that I'm just nitpicking.
