I saw a movie once I thought was going to be like this book. I was excited and settled in for one of my favorites themes: a fight for physical survival alone and against all the odds, and the growth of the hero (in this case, heroine) into someone admirable. Five minutes into the movie and I realized it wasn't going to be what I hoped. One page into this book and it was all I hoped it would be. A great adventure, a great survivor, and a world of pain that turns into a world of wonder. It's all in how you look at it and it's all in who you are - or who you become. Big kudos. Goes on the Always Keep shelf.
