'Dark Places' contains everything that makes a great murder mystery: conflicting accounts of the truth, unnerving characters, a complex and clever protagonist, and an over running theme of macabre. I would almost go as far as saying that it surpasses Flynn's hit novel 'Gone Girl'.Libby Day is still burdened by the brutal murders of her mother and sisters that took place in their family home in 1985 when Libby was just seven years old. Now, thirty-one years of age, Libby has to deal with the pressure of being skint in addition to her emotional burdens. Having lived off a hefty trust fund since the age of eighteen, Libby has never had a job, and she is daunted by the idea of having to seek employment now that her trust fund is almost completely drained. Fortunately for Libby, she has just received an offer of a nice sum of money to appear at an event hosted by crime case enthusiasts. Having no real choice but to accept the offer, Libby attends and subsequently maintains contact with the treasurer of the club. What started out to be cash-exchange offers for appearances and personal belongings, the dealings with the Kill Club soon develop into an appeal for Libby to recant her testimony of convicting her estranged teenage brother, who was rumored to be part of a satanic-worshipping club. Unconvinced that her older brother is innocent, Libby unwillingly decides to embark on an endeavor of finding out what really happened that dark night of the massacre. What began as a quest for financial gain and one which she believed would produce no real or new findings, Libby is astonished at how little she actually knew about the events leading up to that awful night in January 1985. And for the second time in her life, Libby falls into grave danger.Told through personal accounts of Libby Day and third person-narrative flashback accounts of her brother Ben Day and mother Patty Day, the story will have you constantly trying to figure out who was really guilty all along. In an usual way, I found Libby Day one of Flynn's most interesting and likable characters even though she holds a bitterness and hostility and didn't spend her time doing anything constructive or exciting before meeting the Kill Club. Though her lifestyle would make the reader initially think that she is an imbecile, you quickly see that is not the case as she is impressively shrewd and articulate in her beautifully written sections of the book.
