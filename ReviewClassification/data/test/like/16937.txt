Other Reviewers mentioned they didn't like Libby! How can you NOT love Libby. She's emotionally troubled, selfish, lazy, angry and does not want to love anyone including herself. She is exactly how you would expect someone to be when your entire family is butchered while you are hiding and eventually running for your life.Flynn, I bow down to you for not making this character "rise above" her past and for writing a character so perfectly, that my heart literally felt like it was broken while I read the book. That is why I loved Libby, she is who she is, and she wasn't created to make book ratings or financial gains for the author.As for the story, oh my god, I was so frustrated because I couldn't figure out who did it. I was annoyed and I loved it.I forgot to mention the other characters in the book- you will love them even if you hate them. Again, this is what is so great about the author- her characters. The author is brilliant in her character development. Probably one of the best I've read. If you feel emotions like I did about these characters, that is good, it means the author did his/her job.If I could give an award "Best Character Development by an Author". Hands down- Gillian Flynn!
