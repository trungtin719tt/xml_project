This is my third Neal Stephenson book. You could say I'm a fan of his work. You would be correct in such a statement. But, this is not for everybody. His writing style is dense and there is a great deal of information being presented to you. More so than the intricate nature of the information is the fact that, sometimes, the author will take you down a bizarre side track that will actually make you sit there and think about what you just read. If this doesn't seem like something you'd enjoy-then skip out on Neal Stephenson. This is a large book and if you're not down to go through some really fascinating ideas that may have not much to do with the plot, then I'd not even bother.Now for the rest of you that don't mind utterly bizarre side tracks and very high end ideas that actually require you to think (how solitaire can be used an encryption algorithm) and form concepts in your mind-then you will love this dense work. What is it about?There are two time frames where the story takes place, one being during World War II and the other in "modern" (1990's?) times. The cryptography WW II story has to do with the famous minds of Dr. Turning and Dr. Waterhouse who broke the German and Japanese codes. It then becomes a story about the founding of the NSA and in the modern timeline it is a story about building a "Crypt" to store information that governments can't break into. How does this all flow together?The lynchpins are the families who keep appearing- the Shaftoes, the Waterhouses, the Goto's, etc. The story jumps back and forth between World War II and current. The families have changed in that the current generation are the grandchildren of the ones described in World War II. More than that I will not say. It's hard to explain such an amazing plot and I shouldn't. Discover it for yourself.The Marine Shaftoe, the Japanese Army Goto Dengo and the priest Enoch Root are the best characters in here..but there is a lot in here.. just a taste includes Nazi German U-boat commanders, hidden gold, angry Filipino rebels, Japanese Army units, U.S. Marines, Douglas MacArthur, a scary venture capitalist known as the Dentist, an unbreakable cypher as well as various and sundry different side tangents (the equation for optimum masturbation was funny)-well you're starting to see why Neal Stephenson can be a Love or Hate thing. Me? I love this.One of the more unique books and minds out there. Finishing one of his books feels like the end of a day in undergrad- having studied multiple subjects and beginning to grasp that they might all fit together after all. If this seems too tedious then yes skip this book. If this seems fun-then do what I did and take your time and read this savoring every new thought you come up with. NS has a very dry wit and it shows. I truly enjoyed this book and am now a Neal Stephenson fan for life. I appreciate intelligent books and this certainly qualifies.
