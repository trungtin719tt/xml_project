This book I have to say was new to me and I've never read anything like it before but after Netgalley accepted my request to read it I decided that I loved the book and the whole concept of it.It teaches you about the brain in ways you could never imagine. Bernard is transported into his fathers brain and although it has its own little world there, it's still his brain.The people living inside the brain are like two nations like the two sides of the brain. The left side has to learn to get along with the right. Very much like Bernard and his father.When both nations inside his fathers brain decide to go to war Bernard and his new friends must find a way to stop them.In a era where most YA sci-fi fantasy is about finding a girlfriend or boyfriend than engaging in actual fiction, this book was a refreshing change and challenges the reader at all times with different thoughts and emotions.A great read for 12-15 year olds but also for 9-10's too.My rating for this is 4/5
