One of myALL Time Favorites. I lovedEnder's Game, but I think that this novel surpasses it on just about every level. Writing, emotional resonance, characterization and depth. This novel is a much more "adult" read than Ender's Game. It impacted me greatly and I found that it stayed with me long after I finished reading it.6.0 stars. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!Winner: Hugo Award Best Novel.Winner: Nebula Award Best Novel.Winner: Locus Award for Best Science Fiction Novel.Nominee: Campbell Award Best SF Novel.
