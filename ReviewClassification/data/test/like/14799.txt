3.5 stars - SpoilersA rather lovely and quaint coming of age story. It did take a while to get into and was quite slow and boring towards the end, but other than that it was a great read.-How Green Was My Valleyseemed like less of a story and more like a pleasant stroll through the early years of someone's life. More specifically Huw Morgan's life, with him reminiscing about his childhood and the valley that was his home. There was no real solid plot, just Huw looking back at his family, and the many changes/ups and downs he (and his family) had to face. It was delightful to just read about Huw growing up and his everyday life in the valley and the simplicity and struggle of it all.-I adored the old fashioned, picturesque setting. The valley and mining community was portrayed so vividly and beautifully, it was easy to see why Huw loved his valley/home.-I enjoyed Huw's character for the most part, he was much more endearing when he was younger though. I didn't find him as interesting when he was older, he seemed to lose all his charm and depth and just wasn't all that likeable. Thankfully, most of the book was about his childhood rather than his adulthood.-I found Huw's parents quite irritating, Gwilym was so self righteous and Beth was so backwards, I guess that was realistic though for the time. Gwil and Beth's relationship was beautiful though, the love they had for each other was so pure and sweet. Even though they were great together as a couple, they were rubbish parents, I hated how they ruined Angharad's life by pushing her to marry Iestyn instead of Gruffydd. They should have known better than anyone that love would have made Angharard far, far more happier than marrying someone rich. I also hated Gruffydd for not fighting for Angharad, if he had trusted her and had faith in her (and himself) he could have saved them both from a soulless existence, instead they both ended up depressed and lonely.-I didn't enjoy all the melodramatic metaphorical nonsense that Huw monologued about when it came to romantic love, sex, and singing/choir stuff. It was so over the top, flowery and ridiculous. Thankfully, Huw for the most part spent his time banging on about other more interesting coming-of-age stuff.-The Marged story arc was beyond ridiculous, I didn't buy her going crazy and setting herself on fire just because of Owen. Her whole relationship with Owen occurred over the course of a few days, they didn't have a long romance or a deep connection of any kind. Their relationship consisted entirely of a few kisses and half-hearted promises over the course of a week. But for some bizarre reason Marged never recovered from his rejection, even when she got married to Gwilym (who she knew better and had far more of a bond with). Yea, Owen was barely in her life long enough for him to have such an effect on her. The whole thing was daft, if their courtship had been longer or they'd been childhood sweethearts or something then her Owen-related madness/death might have been plausible but that wasn't the case. Ugh, I hated what happened to Marged, so bloody nonsensical.-Even though it was all fictional, the insight into the mining world, and the struggle and fight for fair wages was fascinating (as well as infuriating). It was no doubt a true enough refection on how badly miners and other such workers were treated in those days, it really made me glad not to live in such crappy, hopeless times.-Loved the Welsh brogue, it added to the atmosphere and really gave the tight knit community a genuine feel.-I was disappointed with where the story ended, I would have liked to know more about Huw's family and the valley. What happened to Ceinwen? Did she get to go to London and act? Did Bronwen remarry? Did Angharad and Gruffydd ever find some kind of peace and happiness in Patagonia/Cape Town? How did Beth cope without Gwil? Did the Morgan family ever reunite or keep in contact with each other or did they stay apart their whole lives? I really wanted to continue on with their stories and find out what happened to them.-Apparently, there's three more books about Huw's life but they sound like utter rubbish, and seem to revolve solely around Huw being rich and horny. Yea, I'd rather read about Huw's family than grown-up-immoral-unfaithful-Huw-who-cares-nothing-for-his-childhood-or-the-lessons-he-learnt. I'll have to make do with just this book.
