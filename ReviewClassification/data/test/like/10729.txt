okay, so can I admit that I was weeping at the open of this book? I know, it is stupid. I love animals, and horses in particular, way too much. However, this book was opened so powerfully, I don't know if I can blame my love of animals for my tears this time around. Very well written for pleasure reading and captures the fanfare that was really a part of this horse.I let my grandmother tell me the whole story of how the world was divided as much by the rivalries between fans of Seabiscuit and fans of War Admiral. It was definately the biggest sport on radio at the time. What a nice thing to get to share with her before she passed on the following year!
