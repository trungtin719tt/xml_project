This is the story of a horse and the three men who had the most influence on his career, his owner, his trainer, and his main jockey. Seabiscuit wasn't the most beautiful of horses and he had some physical problems, but he could run and run he did. The celebrated horse was popular in the pre-WWII years as he won many races in the West. He did not run in any of the Triple Crown competitions.This book also discusses the men who found a way to bring the feisty but frequently lazy horse to greatness. 'Tom' Smith, the trainer, is especially interesting since he was a quiet, private individual who asked for nothing more than to be with horses. Red Pollard, the jockey, sacrificed his health to stay atop Seabiscuit, frequently undergoing near torture to make the weight restrictions. The owner, Charles Howard, seemed to be a good man who would scratch the horse from races rather than endanger Seabiscuit in muddy conditions.For five years a horse and three men astounded the racing world with what they could achieve. This book celebrates that achievement.
