This book, in my opinion, was completely different from any other book I've read of Sparks'. And that is a good thing! I would classify this book as a romantic suspense, or even a suspense in general. There were many instances where my heart was racing, and I couldn't find the strength to put the book down. And, as with all of Sparks' book, I found myself tearing up in parts. But not for the normal mushy-gushy reasons. Instead, I was crying because of the traumatic events taking place, and the horror I felt for the main character. The pace of this book was an excellent break from the normal, and I think any Sparks fan will love this book, regardless of the fact that it's so different! Sparks is a great writer, and that definitely shows inSafe Haven.
