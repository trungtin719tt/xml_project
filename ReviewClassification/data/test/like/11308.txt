This book is why I give authors second, third, and sometimes even fourth chances (*cough* Colleen Hoover *cough*). Because while I might not enjoy one book they wrote, I like to think that doesn't mean I'll hate everything they publish.Take Stiefvater. I tried to readShivera while back, and my review for it is literally just this gif:This book is also why I believe in mood reading. I picked it up a while ago and got about 50 pages in before setting it aside. The opening is...not strong. I mean, come on, hints of a love triangle, all that bullshit about fate (which, sorry, not sorry, I don't believe in), and a bunch of spoiled, mysterious rich boys (hmmm...where have I seen that theme a million times before? Oh, right! Every cliched YA book I've ever hated!).Totally not my scene.But so many of my friends rave over this series that I just had to give it a second chance. And boy, am I happy that I did. Because aside from the #richpeopleproblems this plot is pretty fucking original. Slumbering mythical heroes, living dead kids, a wood in which time is merely an illusion, and a female lead who, while slightly manic-pixie-dreamgirl-ish, has been raised to be her own person by a house full of eccentric women?Yeah, sign me up for that shit. All day long.One last gripe, since this is something that needs to be addressed in pretty much every book set in modern times: there is little to no representation of diversity or the lgbt+ community in here. I live near where this book is supposed to take place, so the lack of any people of color or lgbt+ characters really jumped out at me.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Pinterest
