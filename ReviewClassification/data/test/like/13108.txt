I read this book long long time ago. But the impression is still fresh in my mind. I adore this girls. they represent everything about becoming a woman in modern era. Even the story is cheesy on the romantic side, but the moral message is there. The author writes it in a way that the wording resonance with teenagers.every one of us will find some sort of connection with all those girls. Again, this is a beautiful book.
