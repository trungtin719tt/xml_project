After college, I wanted nothing to do with serious books. And so began my quest for all books fluffy and light. The cover of this screamed fluff at me. This book is NOT TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. Take it for what it is - hilarious chick lit. Otherwise, you'll find yourself realizing that if you actually knew a character as shallow as Becky Bloomwood, you'd probably give her a look of disgust and hiss at her as she walked by or something. Also, don't think too much about her relationship with Luke. Because seriously, why would a Luke EVER want a Becky? She's a total tart! So, take my advice and just laugh at Becky's ridiculous justifications for her purchases. Even now, I find myself thinking "If I buy that red hat, I can be known as the girl in the red hat."
