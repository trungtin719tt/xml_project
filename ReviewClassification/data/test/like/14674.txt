I began Girl with the Dragon Tattoo with the goal of understanding what there was about this book that made it so popular. I was gritting my teeth, convinced that getting through the book would be a most unpleasant labor. But then I found myself turning pages, not able to put it down, suprised, pleased, impressed.And so I soldiered on to the second and third books of the series, and I loved them. But to answer my original question: what is it about these books that makes them so popular? Well, I can at least say why I like them so much. In a word, it's characters. Lisbeth is one of the all-time best fictional characters I've ever encountered and it is her story that carries everything through. By the third book there is no doubt that the whole series is really about her. She's unique, well-thought-through, mysterious, yet consistent and totally believable.Almost every other character with a few notable exceptions is similarly well-constructed. There are a few stick figures - minor villians mostly. As for the plots, you could make a case that books two and three are just one long story, but Dragon Tattoo is a distinct story, though it ties closely into the next book. I liked the Dragon Tattoo plot the best, the other story is a bit far-fetched at times, but often engrossing and believable.Two other things that make these books great are the attention to detail and the incredible sense of place. Larson paints vivid pictures of all the locales, including the Caribbean island Lisbeth spends some time on. The plot details are just that - details that sell the story, that make you believe it's happening as you read it.If you are one of the eight people in the world who haven't read these books yet, I do recommend that you get right on it! You won't be sorry.
