I am trying to figure out the building blocks behind this novel: the history of society which lead up to an upper class woman confronting the mores and values of the time by writing this book and rocking the boat from within.Published in 1905, Edith Wharton obviously knew her 'customers' since this book was aimed at the very class she was born into, and not written for the 'plebs' roaming the universities in the hope of improving their chances to join the selected few. Neither did she use a language that would excite the less educated, lower strata of society. In fact, the text was too lexicon perfect. Well, the people who could afford to buy the book did not sweep streets or cleaned the houses of the blessed few, for sure.In another American book, published in 1900, by the V I R Publishing company, written by Mrs. Emma F. Angell Drake, M.D, titledWhat A Young Wife Ought To Know, the rules of marriage is spelled out in no uncertain terms over 290 pages in small print. It is one of my most treasured possessions, with an interesting story behind this gift.Nevertheless, in this book the selection of marriage partners in the upper echelons of American society is explained. The difference between a mistress and a wife is clearly defined. A wife is chosen to carry forward the bloodline of the man. She is selected from the same social circles as the bridegroom, has an impressive inheritance of her own, is well educated for her role to raise the successors to the throne. The wife is compensated by way of property, jewelry, and monetary benefits for her important role as hostess, manager of the estate and home, as well as her role as mother. She has no other sexual obligations to her husband, other than producing the off-springs, securing the continuation of the bloodline. The selection of the wife includes a careful investigation into her family's medical history, and is chosen for her biological and physical attributes (or contribution to the bloodline). Money can buy excellence in everything.For any other 'physical' needs, the bridegroom has a mistress to take care of that. She is provided with a home and financial support, on the condition that she will not produce children or be socially acknowledged by the wife. On breaching the agreement, the mistress will forfeit all privileges and be ousted from society.Gobsmacking, yes. I was blown away when I read this book almost a century later. Whether it was meant as a secret guideline to the selected few, is uncertain. What it did was explain the social conduct of the wealthy that was incomprehensible or probably unknown as well, to the lower classes. It became the source of thousands of novels to this day.It is from this angle, that I read Edith Wharton's tale of Lily Bart inThe House Of Mirth. The young Lily had everything going for her to be accepted as a wife to the rich and fortunate. She had money, the 'right' education(and it wasn't academic in nature), beauty and acres and acres of background to be the most sought-after bride in waiting. But Lily, going against her mother's teachings, decided to not only choose money, but also love in the same sentence. Like Princess Diana, many decades later, Lily rejected the status quo and paid a dear price for her rebellion. The rules for both woman were the same. The consequences as brutal and tragic as the ancient, unchanged blueprint dictated.The difference between the two young women was however that Lily lost everything when her father died and his irresponsible financial dealings came to light (her mother's social ambitions played a big role in his financial demise). Without the impressive financial portfolio to back her up, as well as her mother passing away shortly after her father, Lily became a social outcast. Lost in her own ambitious delusions of grandeur, she battled on, hoping to reach her personal goals and prove her own theory right. Love and money simply should be a symbiotic truth, she believed. One cannot function without the other. But upper society brutally rejected this possibility and taught her a lesson she refused to face.This is the gist of the book, dragged out over a long, often tedious, yet fascinating tale. Based on the reality of the time, the author did not try to create a romantic environment and write a fairy tale for love-sick Romanceaficionados. She was actively confronting a cruel existing establishment who were committing perfect murders of souls and minds safely locked up behind opulent grandeur and greed. Edith Wharton exposed this hidden world for what it truly was and did so in graphic detail in this book. Despite her efforts, nothing really changed. It is still out there, secured by high walls, electric fences, bodyguards and highly trained guard dogs. All defined as status symbols, so by the way.By writing this 'novel', since the protagonists was a fictitious character, Edith Wharton announced her own liberation from this privileged life to become an independent thinker and women in her own right, without the constricting social rules of this part of society.Edith Wharton became one of several women of the time, who paved the way for other women born into this social class, to reconsider their options and liberate their enslavement to this system, if they so desired. Reading many biographies of privileged women who did just that, it is obvious that something happened in their lives to make it happen. The rules of the game did not change, and many aspiring young women from lower classes still work hard at it to get into this kind of life today, since it represents the ultimate definition of true happiness. Money, social standing and privileges spread all around. Let them be.Some of the women born into it at the turn of the twentieth century, had a different perspective on that life. Edith Wharton painted a complete picture. She highlighted both sides of the coin and scratched away the fake gold covering up the even lesser metals below the surface.An excellent historical document, confirming, to me, the rules spelled out to young married women in 1900 in this other book I did not want to believe until many years later, when my world was broadened by more reading and life experiences. And yes, much more research.The book could have been a cold academic assessment of social conditions within a particular income group, but instead the information was presented in the form of a novel to make it more entertaining reading. And it is a good one: picturesque, atmospheric, a strong story line, multiple characters, and a deeper message covering the saga. The author was a truly talented storyteller and writer.Disguised as fiction, truth has a way of capturing and entertaining a much wider audience who can act upon it. Magic.This is why I loved this novel. It gets five stars for the purpose it served and the thought that went into it.
