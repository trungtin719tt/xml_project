I don't read a lot of young adult or middle grade these days, but when I received a pre-publication copy of Brainwalker, I read it through.As is common with many books aimed at these markets, it's written in present tense, which is something I always find myself having to get used to every time. Once I got back into reading present tense, I found it to be a quick read and smoothly written.The book centers on Bernard, a young man who has lost his mother and is having issues at school. An accident places him deep inside his father's brain, and in the resulting adventures he learns and does things that help him understand both his own issues and his father's.The authors do a good job of creating a consistent world inside the brain, with just the right amount of tension. The stakes are high enough to keep the reader interested, but not so high that they will disturb younger readers.If you have a young reader interested in science or the mind, drop a copy in their lap.
