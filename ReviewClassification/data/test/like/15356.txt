So, the first time I read this book I rated it 3 stars, and that was probably a bit high for it, because I hated the ending. I hated it so much, left such a bad taste in my mouth, that it sort of spoiled my thoughts of the whole series. I wanted to reread it, been meaning to for awhile, since there were details that escaped my memory entirely, but I was afraid to - afraid that I would end up still hating it as much, if not more than before.(Allow me to specify.(view spoiler)[When I say ending I don't mean the loop. I was ok with the loop. It made a kind of sense, and it left you with hope that this was the last loop. Roland had the horn. It "felt good, like he never felt it before", and you knew - justknewthat this would be the last time.No, it wasn't the loop.It was Patrick fucking Danville being introduced to the story in the last 100 or so pages, and magically erasing out the Crimson King, the ultimate Big Bad of the story who ended up being some asshole on a balcony throwing sneetches!There was no final confrontation between Roland and Mordred (not really), between Roland and the CK, or between Roland and Walter/Flagg (and I won't get started on how lame of a death that was).(hide spoiler)]But this time I went in with a purpose, and Ifanwanked. Oh, I wanked like nobody's business to make this thing make sense, and to make me not hate it so much.And I did it with such aplomb that I ended up actually being quite at peace with the ending.And I'm glad that I did because, honestly, it's a good series. Oh, there are some parts that aren't quite as good as others (Waste Lands and Song of Susannah, for instance), and there are parts within individual books which get a bit bogged down, or don't entirely make sense, or have some continuity issues - but, overall, I liked it, and I wanted to like it more. I liked the world(s), and the characters. I loved watching them develop as people and grow as a tet. I love the many sides of Roland. There was just so much to like about the series, that I didn't want it to end on such a bad note.Besides, the start of this book is pretty damn awesome. I was caught up in the whole thing from the get-go, even though I was hesitant to pick it up and start it because of my fears of impending doom. The whole first third of the book is pretty much non-stop action and awesomeness... and we couldn't just let that all go because ofKing's inability to write an endingsome crap at the end.So - here's my wank.(view spoiler)[* Climax: Did you feel that the defeat of CK was a bit anti-climactic? Of course you did - because it's not the climax. The real turning points happen when the Beams are saved - first the taking of Blue Heaven and then the saving of Sai King. Sure, as battles goes, the one at Blue Heaven isn't exactly the most exciting of final, epic showdowns - but that was, in many ways, the final showdown. After that point things are sort of winding down and wrapping up.*Patrick Danville: Deus ex Machine from Hell - or a dan-tete (little savior) put in the path of ka? I mean, sure, there's this person that isn't mentioned before who comes out of nowhere and becomes really important to the story - but haven't we seen this before? Isn't the series full of these people? Some called dan-tete, like John Cullum and Irene Tassenbaum, others random people who later become important, like Calvin Tower and Aaron Deepneau, and some pulled from other stories/worlds, like Pere Callahan and Ted Brautigan. Isn't the entire story about ka pushing them along and helping them out? So why not one final dan-tete to help them on their way? And, hey, at least he is mentioned earlier in the story, and Insomnia is brought to Roland's attention, though he leaves it behind.* Crimson King: I'm still disappointed that there wasn't a big, final battle between the White and the Red - but I wouldn't say that Roland didn't have a hand in defeating him. The entire series is Roland chipping away at him bit by bit, in a way. Afterall, CK, being the embodiement of the Red, gains in power from Chaos - when the world is moving away, and the Beams are breaking, so on and so forth. But Roland's entire quest, as champion of the White, is about working against him. Every battle he wins, such as at the Calla, and saving the Beams, and Sai King, is chipping away at the CK - chipping away at his power and, apparently, his mind. Granted, as hubbie puts it, this is victory "in the most ass way possible" - but, still... it's something. ;) And, anyway, aren't we told, time and time again, that the Crimson King is bugfuck insane? Well, guy on the balcony certain qualifies. (p.s. As a reading tip - it really helps if you mentally skip over the 'EEEEEEEEEEEE's.)(hide spoiler)]There - now isn't everything ever so much better?I'll do you one better. I'll tell you how the final loop could go, and how everyone could live happily ever after:(view spoiler)[So, Roland as the horn. According to 'The Road to the Dark Tower' book, the horn is a talisman, a connection for Roland not just to his old life/world/tet, but to his Self, his humanity. When he left the horn, he lost a piece of himself that matters.This time he has the horn - and, thus, his humanity. Because of this, he doesn't let Jake fall. He still catches Walter because, honestly, he was always going to anyway, but Jake's there to watch his back. When they get to the beach, because there are two, Roland doesn't lose the two fingers on his right hand. Maybe Jake does instead, or maybe neither do, but, however it goes, Roland's hand is saved.Because of this, when Roland shoots Pimli at Blue Heaven, he shoots with his strong, perfect hand, and kills him flat out. No lingering death means he never gets a chance to shoot Eddie, which in turn means that they don't have to delay their trip to 1999 to save King while Eddie has his slow, drawn out death. So they get to 1999, all four of them, and with enough time to get where they need to be to save King, and no one has to sacrifice himself in order to do so.Since Eddie and Jake don't die, Susannah (the bitch) doesn't have the need to leave, and Oy doesn't have to sacrifice/suicide himself to save Roland, since all 5 are there, they can take turns taking watch, and Mordred never ends up being much of a threat at all.Everyone survives, and, hell, they can still come across Patrick Danville on the way, 'cause, like I said, what's one more dan-tete - one more convenient coincidence - in a story full of them?Roland gains the Tower, this time worthy of it - a true champion of the White (which he wasn't before, because he failed by letting Jake fall, by losing his humanity and sacrificing anything for his obsession) - and renews the Tower/Universe, and is thus renewed himself... and they live happily ever after.Maybe they get transported to some where and when where they can live out their days... maybe they even come across another Susan or Cuthbert or Alain. I mean, Susannah got copies of Eddie and Jake - so why not? (Ok, I have an answer for why not, actually, but shush.)(hide spoiler)]So, there you have it.But, really, it's not that much fanwank. Some of it actually makes a lot of sense, all things considered. I still think some of the ending was weak, and I'm not going to say it was perfect - but maybe it wasn't quite as bad as I thought it was the first time.(Sort of like how I liked 'Order of the Phoenix' much more on the second read, and 'Deathly Hallows', too, for that matter. Of course, I rationalized those a bit, too. I have a grand gift for it, it seems. LOL)
