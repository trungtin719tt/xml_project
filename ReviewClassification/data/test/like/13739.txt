They stood together in the gloom of the spruces, an empty world glimmering about them wide and gray under the stars.The perfect soundtrack for this novel: "I Need My Girl" by The National.Wow, I'm speechless. It's ten past midnight and I just couldn't go to sleep without finishing this story. Don't let its size fool you, every page of this book is full of raw emotion that will leave you feeling heavy and achy all over. The writing is so elegant and the prose, every word, every phrase was thoughtfully placed and had significance. Oh I just can't praise Edith Wharton enough. This is arguably the best book I've read so far in 2016.
