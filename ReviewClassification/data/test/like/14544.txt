Remember that slow horrible realization you had when you were a kid, when you became conscious of the fact that your parents wouldn't always be there to take care of you and that there are bad things in the world and that we all eventually die alone? This book unearths that feeling from its hiding place in your soul, magnifies it, and plunks it right into the pit of your stomach for 280 pages. There's not a dishonest word in this book - just raw emotion, fear, and hopelessness seeping from every page.(If I could, I would probably take off half a star because it took me too long of a time to ease into Selby's dense, meandering prose. I found myself getting confused at times as to whom was speaking and I had to go back and reread several passages. While I can appreciate "experimental" writing, I also feel that there's value in clarity. However, if you aren't a former English teacher, chances are the lack of punctuation and quotation marks probably won't bother you as much).
