I believe the Bible is the Word of God. I think some will call me crazy but sometimes things don't have to be fully explained to be true. That is kinda the entire point of faith. I also believe there is a God shaped hole in all of us. No matter how hard you try to fill it with money, fame, realtionships, sex, other idols it will NEVER satisfy your soul. You will still be thirsty and searching.Books I have fully read:GenesisExodusRuthHoseaEstherPhilemon1 PeterMatthewMarkLukeJohn1CorinthiansEphesiansCollosiansPhillipians1 Thessolonians2 ThessoloniansTitus1 Timothy2 Timothy2 PeterJamesHebrewsBooks I have read somewhat of:I am starting Leviticus (honestly all the rules get a little boring but they are important)And I've read about half of ReveletionAnd maybe a third of PsalmsA bit of IsaiahStarted ActsYes, there is a lot of abuse, murderer, killing, lying, cheating, stealing and many many more sins in this book but the entire point we as Christians study from this is to try NOT to do these things to the best of our abilities (yes, even Christians are NOT perfect). For example, why do we study the wars? Why is that so important to know about what happened hundreds of years before? What is so important about the past? After all, isn't the past dead? It is BECAUSE of the future that we study the past. We don't want what happened a hundred years ago to happen again, right? So we study it. We Christians don't want to make the same sins so and so did from the bible today. So? We study it. We study the outcome of what the Isrealites did and how it affteced there realtionship with God. Why? So we can try (I say this because yes Christians are NOT perfect because we are ALL human) not to do the same things. So we ca learn to obey what God tells us.When we read the Word of God we learn about how stubburn we humans can be and how even then God STILL loves us. I mean, isn't it amazing that this Holy Awesome Higher Being would want to have a personal realtionship with US?!!! I don't know about you but that just blows my mind.I don't care what anyone else really has to say. God is real and He loves us all a ton. What others have to take on that is there opinion.
