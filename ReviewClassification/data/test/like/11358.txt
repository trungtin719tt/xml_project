Is it even possible to review a legend? To write a review about a completely different and unique world?It is not. It is just not possible.Just imagine writing a review about our world, about all the countries and cities and cultures and all the wars. It would simply be too long and too difficult.What I can say about this book is that theepicjourney finally came to an end.The Fellowship had to fight bloody, hopeless fights, it had to survive epic battles and it found friends where friends were not expected and enemies in those who seemed to be friends at first.Every single member of the fellowship had an own journey. Every single member suffered from losses and yet found something new and unexpected. Every single one discovered truths and lies.The members of the Fellowship fought, they hoped and believed. Until the very end.It is impossible for me to describe just how much I loved each and every character of this world.I loved how the crownless became king, I loved the dwarf and the elf who showed that friendship is stronger than prejudices, I loved the wizard who even faught Death and came back to finish his task and help his friends.But those I loved most were the hobbits. So weak and simple at the first gaze, but so strong and determined and hopefull in the end.Merry and Pippin who showed that they are just as strong as the humans, Frodo who continued his journey although he had no strenght left. Who carried the ring because he knew that only he could safe his beloved ones and the world he loved.And finally Sam. Sam, who was everything for Frodo. Without him Frodo would have died. He wouldn't have come that far without Sam.Every single character that appeared in thisepictrilogy was a hero, was special and able to teach lessons that are useful and necessary for everyone.I felt home in Middle-Earth I still do. I belong to Middle-Earth much more than I belong to this world, but not many people of our time do...
