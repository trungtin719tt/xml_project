While the filmForrest Gumpis excellent (I watch my VHS tape of it at least once a year), the book is also a brilliant classic. With a narration style similar toTo Kill a Mockingbirdand a friendship that lasts from childhood all the way through high school to college and beyond this book tells the story of Forrest, an intellectually-disabled man with childlike innocence, who might just be smarter than anybody gives him credit for. He finds himself present in the events that shaped 20th century history, from the JFK assassination to the Vietnam War, and what keeps him going is his best friend, Jenny.
