I read "A Wrinkle In Time" as a library clerk in the children's department when it first came out and loved it. Bought this edition for my grandson and monopolized his book when I visited his home a month after sending it to him. Loved every minute. I love Science Fiction and this is excellent for the genre. I am intrigued by the fourth book, Many Waters, and its apocryphal references. Interesting interpretation.
