Well. I've only recently started reading a bit more in the thriller genre than I have in decades and I think it's safe to say I'm out of practise! This book was SO SO good, I can't tell you. About half way through I felt I had had enough *thrilling* for the day and put the book down. Tried to read something else...my mind kept coming back to it...picked it up again....got spooked....walk away Emma, walk away...it's getting late, it's dark, it's raining hard...the lunatics are taking over the asylum....mwahhaha...That Dennis Lehane is a clever bloke. He manipulated me! And it also it WAS dark and rainy while I was reading it. My levels of fear, stress, panic and paranoia matched the lead characters.Needless to say I finished this in a day(and well into the night) and was so overexcited by the whole thing I could barely sleep.Also needless to say, and to my shame and embarrassment, I didnt pick up a single clue! Not a one. Dennis got me good!This was my first book by this author. On reading others' reviews, I find to my astonishment, that this is not considered his best work, although it does have 5 star ratings from practically everyone. It was a great place for me to start however because I love historical fiction and this hooked me in even more. New-to-me author, long list of published books by him, happy days...*rubs hands in anticipation*. Next!#recommended
