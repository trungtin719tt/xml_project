people like talking shit about charles bukowski on goodreads, it seems funny.i liked this book a lot. henry chinaski is an asshole but he knows he's an asshole and simply accepts being an asshole. everything seems detached and transient, nothing really matters to him, life is just this "thing that is happening" which he feels powerless to, so he doesn't invest much emotion in the things he feels like he needs to do to stay alive, and drinks to avoid feelings of alienation. i laughed out loud several times, alone.this is the first bukowski novel i've read. i understand how people could claim that he's misogynistic, but it seems more to me like he is someone who is extremely detached from people in general, but also enjoys the experience of sex. when he talks about women in an "overly sexualized" way, they are usually women he doesn't know. in my experience, i usually objectify/have enhanced biases towards strangers of any kind -- or like, when i see a man i don't know who i'm intensely attracted to, i usually focus strongly on his physical characteristics because it's impossible to do anything else without knowing someone. bukowski seems to objectify women in a way that is not offensive, it just strikes me as what people who don't interact with a lot of people do, because people are always at a distance. he objectifies everything, kind of.i empathized with him a lot. if he were alive and someone it made sense for me to know, i would probably have intense feelings for him and we would have sex but he wouldn't be able to fall in love with me because he was too self-involved/depressed, or he'd see that i care too much or something. still, reading this made me feel less alone.i recommend this book to people who are depressed, introverted, maybe have had problems with alcohol, disenchanted with people/society in general, don't like lengthy descriptions/cliches/"language masturbation," and are able to view life with a detached, sarcastic eye.
