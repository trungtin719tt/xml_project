trigger warning for this book: Rape.(Which I didn't know going into this novel.)Daughter of the forest is a retelling of the fairy tale of theSix Swans by the Brothers Grimm.I've heard that story a couple of times when I was a child, and the way the author tells it in this book is amazing.I adored this book.I must admit that there were moments when I didn't connect with the story (the beginning was soooo slow) and I thought of DNF this book before I reach the 20% mark.I'm so glad I didn't.The tale of the six swans tells the story of a family that is cursed because the father and Lord of the land marries a witch that transforms his six sons into swans. Their sister is the only one capable of breaking the curse, by sewing six shirts that must be made by this plant that will cause her terrible pain every time she touches it. Also, she can't speak ever again or pronounced any sound because if she does, then the cursed will remain. At the time she finish the shirts, she must put them onto her brothers, for them to become humans again.In this book there are some twists to the original story, but the content of the tale is the same. For example, in this book there is a love story between Sorcha, the protagonist, and a character named Red that is BEAUTIFUL. There are a lot of topics surrounding war and politics. And every brother is a well constructed character, they are not just there for plot's sake, but because each one is an important character to the story.This book has a lot of sad moments, and it made me felt helpless a lot of times, because a lot of unfair things happened to Sorcha and I just wanted her to complete her task and save her brothers without so much pain along the way.It made me cry a lot. But it was beautiful and heart-touching at the same time, soit's definitely a roller coaster of feelings.I highly recommend it if you like retellings,and if you want to read a story that will affect you emotionally.
