***********Spoiler Alert**********When we first meet Jean Paget , she appears as a quiet, unassuming young woman , who has suddenly inherited a large sum of money.Jean's story gradually unfolds as she tells of the terrible ordeal she suffered through on a death march in Malaya , at the hands of the Japanese during WW II . It is then that we discover that she has guts, heart and smarts .As the story proceeds , we learn just how courageous and savvy , she really is . After going back to Malaya to give back to the people of the small village that saved her and a band of other women and children , she goes on to the rough, outback of Australia to the man who helped her on the march and suffered a horrible punishment for it .During the last part of the book , I just couldn't shake the feeling that something bad was going to happen to Jean or Joe . I'm so glad I was wrong .Shute tells us that the death march actually occurred , but in Sumatra , rather than Malaya .This is a wonderful story of courage , perseverance and love . I'm not sure how I got this far without having read a Nevil Shute novel, but I'm glad there are more to read .
