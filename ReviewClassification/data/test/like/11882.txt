That was so much fun, I seriously loved it. If you're a fan of The Vampire Diaries (the show, not sure about the books since I haven't read them) I think you will love this because it has a lot of the same elements:vampires? OBVIOUSLY.hot guys? CHECK.action-packed ass-kicking? LOTS.crazy twists and turns? YUP.I seriously want to start a campaign to get this series made into a show. I'm really excited to start the next book in the series.
