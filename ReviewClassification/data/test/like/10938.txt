4.5 stars"Needle and thread, flesh and boneSpit and sinew, heartbreak is homeYour suture lines sparkle like diamondsBright stars to light my confinement"Wow, I really liked the first book in the series but this one kinda blew me away. It was way better than the first. The emotions, the tears, the heartbreak.I swear I nearly went to Youtube, trying to find the bloody band so I could hear the songs. Had to use my imagination. This author could definitely become a songwriter."The bow is so old, its horsehair is glueSent to the factory, just like me and like youSo how come they stayed your execution?The audience roars its standing ovation"This book takes place three years after the end of the first book. As with the other book, I avoided a lot of reviews. I'm glad I did, as I didn't want anything to mar the pleasure of reading this one."I'll be your mess, you be mineThat was the deal that we had signedI bought a hazmat suit to clean up your wasteGas masks, gloves, to keep us safeBut now I'm alone in an empty roomStaring down immaculate doom"
