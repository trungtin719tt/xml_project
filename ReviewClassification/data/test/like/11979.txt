If Anne Frank was 13 when Germans came to Netherlands, Elie Wiessel was 15 when the same thing happened in Romania. Two teenage children who saw the atrocities of the German armies who were blinded by their loyalty to Hitler. There were a few differences: Anne Frank died in the concentration camp while Elie Wiessel survived. Anne Frank's diary, first published asThe Diary of a Young Girlin 1950, was written in young girl's language while she was on a hiding whileNightby Elie Wiesel tells the experience of a 15-y/o boy inside the concentration camps told later in the language of a 30-y/o man. Of course, I am not expecting Wiesel to doalaFrank McCourt inAngela's Ashes, winning the Pulitzer and later be hounded by controversy that what he told in the story were exaggerated if not untrue. ReadingNightwas still a haunting and extremely sad experience for me just like any other holocaust novels that I've read so far. I just thought that it would have been more gripping if Wiesel put more meat in his descriptions of the locales in the same manner as what Imre Kertezs (another Holocaust survivor) did in hisFatelessnessand of course, Thomas Kennealy (he is a writer only) inSchindler's List.They are just too many books on Holocaust now and these are just the 4 among the more "famous" ones but my heart still cries buckets of tears while reading them.Critiquing a well-loved book like this is like blasphemy. I just feel like I am doing the 6 million Jews who perished in that horrendous shameless genocide an injustice if I say something about any literature depicting what they went through.What they went through has marked a permanent etch in our collective psyche. Their stories need to be told to and read by all the future generations. I hope that this generation and all the next ones will remember the Holocaust and learn the lesson from it. Saying these things is almost like aclichesince it is just stating the obvious from a well-known fact.This sounds like a beauty-pageant-kind-of-question but if I were given a chance to talk to one famous living person, I would chooseElie Wiesel. I will ask him what exactly he was thinking in that scene when the young boywith angel's sad facewas hanged. He was looking at the boy, who because he weighted light (being a boy), did not die right away but hanged there still breathing for few hours. Somebody at the back said:"Where is God? Where is God now?"The 15-y/o Wiesel said:"Where is He? Here He is - He is hanging here on this gallows."I know that he lost faith in God, but later in the scene when there was another "selection" he cried out to God again. I would like to know how he was able to switch back his faith despite what he was experiencing in the camp. What is it that make us believers cling on to God despite being all the hopelessness and desperation that we all go through at times?Elie Wiesel is in the second row from the bottom. 7th guy from the leftOh, I have other questions but I hate long reviews. Primo Levi is next.
