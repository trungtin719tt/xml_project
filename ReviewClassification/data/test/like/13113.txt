I was almost ashamed to love this book, because I'm REALLY not one for "chick lit"...give me Gothic or intrigue any day! However, I think this series is really exceptional. The experiences cannot be typified -although there is romance, I appreciate how it does not fall into the "crush/agony/happily-ever-after" triptych that is common to most "chick lit" novels.I think Ann Brashares is remarkably gifted at describing emotions and experiences -she chooses seemingly minor incidents and trains her descriptive powers on them until you see the intricacies just as she does. I would be interested to see her in another genre -maybe historical fiction? I think she would excel at that -she could really enliven history.
