This book was part of my "fantasy summer" reading, and it rocked my world. The first "To Live" book was hilarious, the second was throbbing with humor and pain, and this one was amazing. Shawn Michals has left Los Angeles and finds himself on an island (a bit vague how he got there) that bears great resemblance to many countries in turmoil these days. He is seduced by a mystery woman and finds himself in the midst of a wild rebellion that forces him to confront himself, weaknesses and strengths be damned. Along the way, he encounters fantasies of both violence and peace. Overall, this is the best of the "To Live" series (though the others weren't bad either.)
