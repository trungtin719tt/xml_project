Actual Rating: 3.5 (for both!)I don't know why this took me a month to read, it didn't feel that long, I guess it was because of classes...but I really enjoyed these 2 books! I'm familiar with the characters and the general storyline (Atleast from book 1) from watching a little of the show, but it's so different in the book omg.Book 2 was probably my favorite one (maybe even a 4*) just because of the ending! I wasn't expecting it, till maybe a chapter before where I was like "Hmmmm maybe....", I can't wait to see what happens next. I really gotta pick up the next bind up and read more of it, I can't believe LJ Smith went there so early on in the series! (I also really want to find out more about Katherine, so I hope we get that too because I'm a sucker for the flashback scenes!)I also can't believe I haven't picked these up sooner, just because I really like Smith's writing style (though I know the later books aren't written by her :')). Because this was a first time read for one of my favourite authors I actually sticky noted the entire book with my opinions and predictions. That might even be the reason I found this book kinda kept me from a complete slump, because it was so fun to sticky note!My current favourite brother as of these books is Stefan...so we'll see how that goes through the series...
