Emma is the last novel Jane Austen published before dying, and (along with Mansfield Park) one of her longest. For Emma, she upgraded publishers; this was published by the more prestigious John Murray, who also had Byron. She was treated as a respected writer by Murray, and Emma got more attention than her previous books, including a review from famous boring guy Walter Scott, who called her "a gifted creature." (Not to give the wrong impression: Austen wasn't widely recognized as a genius until much later. During her lifetime she was a mildly successful, mildly respected author whose pen name was "A Lady.")How often is happiness destroyed by preparation, foolish preparation!Emma is a terrific protagonist: complicated, carefully drawn, fully human. Not everyone cares for her; I do.Where there is a wish to please, one ought to overlook, and one does overlook a great deal.I was struck by how utterly in command of her writing Austen is throughout the book; how carefully she's able to present information, making it clear who knows what and who's guessing incorrectly about what else and why everything is going down. Austen doesn't always tell you everything - she trusts you to pick up much of what's happening on your own - but it's all there for you. It's flawless, in that it does exactly what it sets out to do.And as always, she's endlessly quotable.Certainly silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way. Wickedness is always wickedness, but folly is not always folly. - It depends upon the character of those who handle it.Message-wise, there are some squidgy moments. Unless I'm mistaken, there's a message about the dangers of trying to look above one's station that doesn't sit well with modern readers, right? Which isn't completely in line with the message of the time; Austen loved Samuel Richardson, who thought that class movement was entirely possible as long as there was a hot poor lady. But it is what it is, and it's just about perfect at being what it is.
