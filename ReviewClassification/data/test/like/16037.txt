The Horse Whisperer is one of the ebst books I have ever read. It is so detailed and gives so much background information that Nicholas Evans makes you feel connected to the characters personally. It is the story of a girl named Grace, who was in a terrible accident involving a semi truck while she and her friend, Judith, were riding their horses. Now, her life is changed forever. Judith is dead, Grace only has one leg, and her horse has turned into a terrified beast. Grace's relationship with her mother is constantly tested. It will take a miracle to make things right again. Annie, Grace's mother, believes she has found the miracle when she contacts Tom Booker, a "horse whisperer." He has learned how to communicate with horses, but he has never dealt with problems with people before. So Annie packs up Grace and her horse, Pilgrim, and makes te trip from New York to Montana to visit Tom Booker. Grace is furious and gives her mom the silent treatment for many weeks. As they finally start to fit in on the ranch, everyone learns lessons about each other and themselves. They come together to get through what has become a very trying time.I would recommend this book to anyone. It was so good I couldn't put it down. It is a story of love and understanding and pulls on the heartstings of the reader. It was truly amazing.
