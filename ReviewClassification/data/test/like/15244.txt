This might be the best first-in-series I've ever read. I have favorite series, and this is definitely one of them, but most of the time my favorite book in the series is not the first one.This one is.I love Elena. I love Clay. I love them together, and I HATE them separated. I love their issues, and I love their issues getting resolved even more.I can't think of a single think about this book that Idon'tlike.ALSO Clayton Danvers might be my all-time favorite book boyfriend:1. He's a friggin' HOT werewolf.2. He has no problem being in a relationship with a strong female.3. He is the epitome of all things loyal.4. He would doanything, A-N-Y-T-H-I-N-G to keep Elena safe/rescue her. I'm talking you'd have to kill him to stop him, and he's damn hard to kill.5. He mates for life.6. He's a good dad.7. He's refreshingly forthright.I could go on (and on, and on). I love him more than Curran Lennart &lt;----I didn't even know his last name until I just looked it up. I love him more than Trent Kalamack. More than Eric Northman. More than Ricky-bo and Cuffs Alistair. More than Edward and Peeta.Get it?
