Ferdinand the Bull is not like the other young bulls. He doesn't like to run, jump and butt heads with the other calves. He likes to sit under his favorite tree and smell the flowers. His mother doesn't mind as long as he's happy.One day men show up to choose the fiercest, scariest, strongest bull to fight in the big bullfight in Madrid, Spain. All of the other bulls ran, jumped and charged to show the men how fierce and strong they were. But it is Ferdinand who is chosen after being stung by a bee and flying through the air, running, snorting and pawing the ground. Ferdinand is taken to the big bullring in Madrid. Many people are there along with many ladies with beautiful flowers in their hair. The Matador, Banderilleros and the Picadores all march into the ring, holding their spears and posturing. All are excited to see the bull get gored and blooded and finally die.When the gates are opened to let the bull in, Ferdinand runs out, excited to be in such a grand place. The Matador, Banderilleros and Picadores were terrified that the bull was going to come after them immediately. Ferdinand ran to the middle of the ring, sat down and proceeded to enjoy the flower smell coming from the ladies. Finally everyone gives up and Ferdinand is returned to his pasture to enjoy his trees and flowers.
