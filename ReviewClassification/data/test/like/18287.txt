I must admit that the original "Wrinkle in Time" didn't really hold up as well as I expected it to. I read it back in elementary school, and remembered it was one of the greats. However, as an adult, I found being bashed over the head with Christian mythology, which I didn't recall from childhood, annoying. Also, I got the impression that Ms. L'Engle got to 120 pages and suddenly realized she was under some contract to write no more than 132 pages, so rushed the ending. Don't get me wrong, I didn't think it was terrible, just not nearly as great as I remembered.The other books, however, were great sequels, maintaining the storyline, even though there's little need of prior knowledge. The quality of writing is consistent, and the tales are generally well told, although the last's ("Many Waters") ending is also rushed.
