When I was a kid, my grandma had this pinched-copper wind-up train. You gave it a couple cranks and the engine would circle the station while the music box churned a mournful tune. For reasons I couldn't explain then, and can only slightly explain now, the train always made me sad.That's how I felt while reading Norman Maclean'sA River Runs Through It and Other Stories. It's not the obvious tragedy in the first (and most famous) story in the collection that got me feeling this way. Rather, it's the elegiacal tone, the sense of an old man looking back at a time that was gone for him, and to which he could never return.Norman Maclean spent just about his whole life as an English professor at the University of Chicago. Late in life, his wife of 37 years died, and shortly thereafter, he retired from his job and completed these three stories:A River Runs Through It,Logging and Pimping and "Your Pal, Jim", andUSFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky. The stories arrived like lightning from the clear blue sky, because this was a guy in his 70s suddenly showing this amazing talent.It's not really surprising he waited so long, though. I don't think Maclean could have written these stories any earlier. He needed to wait until his wife was gone, and he was approaching his own death, because the subtle mission of these tales is an attempt to understand the people he loved, who were now dead and gone. (Similarly, Maclean's meditation on the young smoke jumpers who died in Mann Gulch can be found in the awesomeYoung Men and Fire).A River Runs Through Itis about Maclean's brother, Paul, who was murdered in 1938. It is the best piece of the collection and transports you to early 20th century Montana in a way that will make you want to take up fly fishing and find a time machine.The first lines pull you in: "In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly fishing." But this isn't a book about fly fishing, it's about a brother that was loved but not understood. This isn't clear at first, and you are lulled into thinking this is a rosy memoir of a couple kids growing up wild, fishing and drinking and fishing and going to church and fishing. It's told with a dry wit, though every so often Maclean turns on the eloquence, as in this description of the art of fly fishing:Below [Paul:] was the multitudinous river, and, where the rock had parted it around him, big-grained vapor rose. The mini-molecules of water left in the wake of his line made momentary loops of gossamer, disappearing so rapidly in the rising big-grained vapor that they had to be retained in memory to be visualized as loops. The spray emanating from him was finer-grained still and enclosed him in a halo of himself. The halo of himself was always there and always disappearing, as if he were candlelight flickering about three inches from himself.There's a little of Hemingway in the way Maclean writes. There are pages of fairly terse, on-the-nose storytelling interspersed with these soaring passages that can really give you the shivers (especially if you can imagine, as I was, Robert Redford narrating). The end of the book is powerful, and underlined by one of my favorite passages in all of book-dom.Of course, now I am too old to be much of a fisherman, and now of course I usually fish the big waters alone...I often do not start fishing until the cool of the evening. Then in the Arctic half-light of the canyon, all existence fades to a being with my soul and memories and the sounds of the Big Blackfoot River and a four-count rhythm and the hope that a fish will rise. Eventually, all things merge into one and a river runs through it. The river was cut by the world's great flood and runs over rocks from the basement of time. On some of the rocks are timeless raindrops. Under the rocks are the words, and some of the words are theirs.After this novella, the rest is, to be honest, anticlimax. Reading the next two stories reminded me of a Boy Scout trip I'd taken in my youth. We went to Banff in Alberta, Canada. There, we saw the snow-capped mountains and the turquoise lakes and wondered at the marvel of it all. Then we drove through Saskatchewan. The other two stories included in this collection are Saskatchewan.Of them, I likedLogging and Pimpingthe least. It's about a logger named Jim that Maclean meets while working for the Anaconda Company along the Blackfoot River. The tone, which could be called "raunchy" by Maclean standards, feels a little off. (There is actually nothing raunchy at all in the story, other than the implicit acknowledgment that people have sex). Maclean more self-consciously takes on a tougher posture, closely resembling Hemingway's short stories about the Michigan peninsula. The problem is, this is a pose that doesn't really fit Maclean's reflective style.The last story is a big improvement. I'd liken it to spending a day on the lake drinking beer and fishing. There's no real point to the exercise, but it makes you feel good for some reason or another. This yarn recounts Maclean's days working for the Forest Service. This was back in the days when being in the Forest Service didn't require anything but the willingness to hop on a mule and go camp by yourself in the forest for weeks on end. The fact that this is no longer possible, and I will never get to do this - at least get paid for it - makes me really depressed. I can't think of anything better than throwing some food and a book into my battered frame pack and tromping along a narrow switchback to a valley camp with a view of the mountains and the infinite sky. (Dear wife: it's a guy thing, and not personal).Maclean is in his element when he is describing, and he falters a bit when he tries to swagger (his use of the f-word is jarring and out-of-place). I got a little bored as he described an endless card game with the titular cook. On the other hand, I was always up for listening to Maclean talk about the mountains.In the late afternoon...the mountains meant all business for the lookouts. The big winds were veering from the valleys toward the peaks, and smoke from little fires that had been secretly burning for several days might show up for the first time. New fires sprang out of thunder before it sounded. By three-thirty or four, the lightning would be flexing itself on the distant ridges like a fancy prizefighter, skipping sideways, ducking, showing off but not hitting anything. By four-thirty or five, it was another game. You could feel the difference in the air that had become hard to breathe. The lightning now came walking into you, delivering short smashing punches.Reading Maclean always reignites my smoldering desire to head out for the mountains and find a trail-head that isn't packed with day-trippers who just piled out of their Escalades and motor homes. This is especially true as I write this, with the first breath of spring washing over the land. These stories serve a helpful reminder that there are other places besides the dreary, dingy courthouse where I spend my days.Maclean's writing is second-best to actually walking the mountain trails, hearing the distant rumble of water through a canyon, and seeing so many stars overhead that you are forced to utter an expletive in wonder at it all.
