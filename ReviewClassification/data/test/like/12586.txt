Because of Winn-Dixie is such a beautiful and enchanting book. I loved reading this with my daughter. I am glad she was a little bit older when we read it (I think she was about 8) as it may have been a little heavy for her if she had been much younger. Although it I guess it depends on the child.Young Opal has just moved to Florida with her father (a preacher) and is lonely for her mother who left the family seven years before. On a trip to the supermarket (Winn-Dixie) she rescues a dog getting into trouble inside. Opal becomes her best friends and together they meet many wonderful characters over the summer. She loves all of the stories from her new friends like the town librarian, a local woman who is rumored to be a witch as well as a guitar-playing ex-con pet store clerk. These characters and their stories help Opal to start to connect with other children, help deal with her loss and sadness and even realize that others may be dealing with loss and sadness of their own.This book deals with such important themes - grief, hope, acceptance, loss and friendship. It has many lessons about people and how we should try to not judge by appearances. The power that love has in helping deal with loss and coping with real life. I myself have a great love of animals and believe in their healing power.It was a really nice book to read with my daughter and we had many discussions as we read. The story pulled us both in. The writing is great and the story is captivating.A wonderful novel that I would recommend for all ages.
