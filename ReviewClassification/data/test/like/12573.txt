He began to see that the town was a book of humanity infinitely more palpitating, varied, and compendious than the gown life. These struggling men and women before him were the reality of Christminister, though they knew little about Christ or Minister. That was one of the humours of things. The floating population of students and teachers, who did know both in a way,were not Christminister in a local sense at all.The above quote really reminds me of my university town for my B .Ed program. The population was quiet in summer, but managed to triple in the fall. But I digress....A number of years ago, I was sitting on a train discussing books with a fellow English teacher. I told her that I recently had "discovered" Thomas Hardy and was left emotionally drained byTess of the D'Ubervilles. She then asked me "Have you read Hardy's "Jude the Obscure?" I confessed that I hadn't. She smiled and told me not to forget about it. I did go on to read many of Hardy's books, such as;Far from the Madding Crowd,The Woodlanders, andThe Return of the Native. However,"Jude" remained in my TBR pile crying out to be read. I just wasn't listening.Well, I FINALLY decided that March Break 2016 was the time to get into it. Boy, am I glad that I did!Jude Fawley, an orphan, raised by his elderly aunt is growing up in a small English village. His life at first glance,appears to be nothing special nor any different than any other young boy. However, when our story opens the village schoolmaster, Richard Philliston(who I kept calling Philistine)is packing up to move to the larger centre of Christminister. No one is more devastated than young Jude, who has come to appreciate the pleasure of books.Jude dreams of one day also being able to make his way to this place of higher learning and applies the remainder of his youthful pursuits to reading Greek, Latin, and other classical texts. Jude, we also see is no stranger to hard work and applies himself to an apprenticeship. Things seem to be be leading Jude to make his dreams come true.Except that Jude meets Arabella Donn. A young woman who sees the innocent Jude as a potential husband. Hardy presents Arabella as an opportunistic and cunning woman who takes advantage of the good natured Jude, who does fall head over heels with youthful affection. In fact, it's Arabella's female friends that guide Arabella in how to ensnare Jude into matrimony. Just like all the soap opera characters, Arabella announces that she's pregnant and Jude does the noble thing and marries her.It is not too long after that Arabella reveals her fib and the young couple almost appears to drown in their misery. Married life seems to plod along and both wonder what's to become of it. Until Arabella leaves Jude behind and emigrates to Australia. Keep in mind they're still married. Oh, and we will meet up with Arabella again!Jude, not wanting to stay in a town that knows his story sets out for Christminister. Before his departure his aunt cautions Jude to not contact his cousin, Sue, who lives in that city. It is revealed that there is a history between the two families and that no good would ever come of the two young people being friends or more.Of course, Jude and Sue do meet and discover a mutual attraction to one another. Over a matter of years, their relationship will evolve from friend to lovers. Both the characters and readers will be sent on a very emotional roller coaster taking place over a number of years. I won't say anything more regarding all the details. But like its predecessor, "Tess", this book isn't going to have a Walt Disney ending.So why read it? First, it's the last book Hardy ever wrote and coupled with Tess, the most controversial books that he wrote. Who doesn't like a little controversy? The 19th century was pretty shaken up by Hardy's flexible manner on marriage, religious beliefs, sexuality, class division, access to education, etc. Although we like to consider ourselves further evolved than the Victorians, there is plenty of what Hardy discusses then that is incredibly relevant today.Second, Hardy's characterization of men and women is multi-faceted. Hardy doesn't expect us to like his characters in everything they do. Hardy just allows them to be who they are. I knew from the moment that Jude was warned about Sue, I was going to be sitting up and paying attention to every detail. I grew fearful and irritated,but not always at the same time."Jude the Obscure" is definitely worthwhile reading, especially if you're in search of dialogue and not just happy endings.Is it wrong,Jude, for a husband or wife to tell a third person that they are unhappy in their marriage? If a marriage is a religious thing,it is possibly wrong; but if it is only a sordid contract, based on material convenience to householding, rating, and taxing, and the inheritance of land and money by children, making it necessary that the male parent should be known- which it seems to be - why surely a person may say, even proclaim upon the housetops, that it hurts and grieves him or her?
