I finished it!!!!I'm not even going to try to summarize this, enough readers have already done so and to be honest, it's so huge, so SO HUGE that I wouldn't even know where to start. Only that it's about a man born without the comfort of national borders, trying to find where he belongs in this world, and a half caste girl, a princess, who would give her life to find it with him.I loved it. I lived it. I feel like I've died a thousand deaths over the last two weeks reading it.If you haven't already read this, by all means pick up a copy. But don't even think about reading it until you're thoroughly in the mood for a long, hot, Indian epic. I had this on my shelf for going on three years, waiting for the right time. You can only read something for the first time once, so choose carefully.My favorite part: Ash's childhood in India and later.... SUTTEE!!!My least favorite part: The last 150 pages, the Afghanistan war. Some parts were intriguing and some parts (endless battle scenes) were snooze worthy. I mainly read those bits to see who else had died.Highly recommended.CONTENT:SEX: One scene, not explicit but not really for young readers either.VIOLENCE: Some battle scenes, poisonings, Suttee, assassinations etc, not gratuitous, but people do die.LANGUAGE: Mild profanity sparsely scattered throughout.
