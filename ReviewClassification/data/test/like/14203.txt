The House of Night Series is filled with drama. At times I feel im reading a teenage soap-opera. But It is highly addicting. And as the series continue I feel that each books gets darker and each of the characters get more entangled in conflicts but they mature.I specially started to enjoy the series more when the different point of views of the characters started to appear. I found that Aphrodite, Stevie Rae and Stark are complex and interesting characters.In the beginning I found Stevie Rae an annoying character but after tempted I started falling for her and I absolutely loved her in Burned.Burned is by far the best book in the series so far. (SPOILER ALERT) I found Rephaim and Stevie Rae's story to be far more interesting than Zoey's. Don't get me wrong I still love Zoey and Stark but Stevie Rae/ Rephaim go through something so beautiful gradually. Its like the beauty and the beast story. I'm hoping Rephaim turns human and gets together with Stevie Rae! Love them!!!
