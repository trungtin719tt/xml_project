"This book makes me feel smarter," says my GR friend in her review of this book. I worked the same for me.Greek, Roman and Norse mythologies are so old because they have been in existence thousands and thousands of years even before Christ was born. No wonder that many literary works have been based on them. Even the names of the planets and the stars. Even the names of my, mortal as they are, relatives and friends. I have a nephew by a cousin in Canada whose name isHectorbut he does not write stories as his passion is on computers. In the island where I grew up, there was a boy namedApollowho was naked the whole day that I could see his wang dangling while we played and he oftentimes cried when he lost in our games and I thought that, while reading this book, he did not even have a slight semblance of the Greek god he was named after. Along Roxas Boulevard, there is a niteclub calledAthenawhere I bring company male visitors if they are giving me hints that they would like to see naked dancing Filipinas. Well, I am just trying to be a gracious hospitable host allowing my foreigner friends happy during their visit. But I think that none of those girls exhibit wisdom, reason and chastity that are the virtues of the goddess their place of work was named after. Maybe their frequent ordering of ladies drink while theyreasonthat they are thirsty can be considered aswisdom, but please pardon me if I don't comment about chastity.My favorite part is the Trojan War. I know, I know. I have not read Homer'sThe Iliadand I am ashamed. Prior to reading this book, I thought that Troy is Brad Pitt. This book taught me that Troy was a city and Brad Pitt's name in the movie should have beenAchilles. I was also amazed to learn thatPerseuswas really the one who severedMedusa'ssnake-decorated head just like in Rick Rioldan'sPercy Jackson and the Olympian's The Lightning Thief. So, Rioldan really stuck to the myth after all.Hamilton's re-telling of those old myths is considerably interesting. I just can't remember all those hard-to-pronounce many names. However, the knowledge that I got reading each story was really overwhelming. This is really a book that needs to be read by everyone.Thank you, Atty. Monique for recommending this book to me. You're such a smart lady and I am happy to be your friend! Let's buddy read Bulfinch soon!
