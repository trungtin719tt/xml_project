On the Wings of Love"He who binds to himself a joyDoes the winged life destroy,But he who kisses the joy as it fliesLives in eternity's sun rise."William BlakeThis novel is structured with a fictional novelist writing a novel (meta-fiction) based on the life of his grandmother (which character is partly based the life of a real woman). The story travels between1) the 1st person account of the novelist, a retired lit prof who recently had a leg amputated, after which his wife left him for his surgeon; and,2) the novel within, written in the objective 3d person about his prudish grandmother, a Quaker-raised painter/author from the Northeast who married a mining engineer (grandpa) and moved west, thereafter migrating frequently to new places/jobs between 1870 &amp; 1895.While many tout this book for its portrait of the new America in the West, I found this book the most penetrating for its meditations on:the struggle to maintain marital vows after an endless string of financial travesties and broken dreams;the devastating cost of one spouse's refusal to forgive and let go of resentments (a cancer to the soul, love and the family as a unit); and, most significantly,the overwhelmingly redemptive power and wisdom of true forgiveness as an absolute necessity to a life well lived.A high recommendation with a proviso that the first 60 pages get kind of tedious due to Stegner establishing the meta-fiction structure.
