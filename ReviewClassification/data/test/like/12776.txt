Definitely a fast-paced book that was breathtaking at times which took me into the world of of cyberism and national intelligence. What I love about this book was that the heroine, Susan, was a female. Not only that, but she was one of the important asset to breaking the code.As we may know or realize (or not), our government has many top secret infos and files with top-of-the-line technologies, firewalls, and so on. Imagine when someone was blackmailing the agency and was on the verge of exposing the database to viruses/worms/hackers, that person dies before the agency was able to obtain the passkey to stop the destruction. This book will take you on an exciting adventure in a male-oriented (like Cidamon said) world, and you should not be disappointed (hopefully!)
