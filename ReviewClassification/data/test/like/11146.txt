Having read the play I am now totally enchanted by Rosencrantz and Guilderstern are Dead.Rosecrantz And Guildenstern Are Dead follows two minor characters from "Hamlet" as all the action from that play sweeps around them. It is absurd, funny, sad and poignant by turns.Sir Tom Stoppard is quite possibly the greatest playwright of the 20th Century.I can't wait to watch the filmed version that I got from the library.
