MacDonald( the Canadian actress and playwrite)has truely shown the depth and beauty of her talent in her debut novel, Fall on Your Knees. Her words flow with ease, allowing the story to unfold as though real and not on a page. The historical detail, layers of generations and depth of the characters draw you in as you live their lives with them.Fall on Your Knees is a story of a family from Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. It is centered around four sisters and their relationships with each other and with their father.Set in coal-mining community of Nova Scotia, FYK follows the sisters as they come across the hardships and roles they must have in that particular culture.Set in the early 1900s, FYK also venturs from Canada and shines light on the Jazz scene in NYC during the 1920s as well as WW1.This is a book I am excited to read a second or third time.It took me longer than I had anticipated to finish this book. I savored her words as I cringed at the events. The hardships and lives her characters were born into broke my heart. I felt let down as every male character in the book was more than faulted. Each man had abandoned responsibility for a brief something....Sex, Money, alcohol. Family values and true love among the men were not present. A child's welfare did not matter. Perhaps MacDonald has been wronged by a number of men in her life....if that is so it shows in FYK.Not quite sure how to end this....it is an excellent book..but now as I am remembering all the events that occured and the hurt and pain I felt through mere words on a page perhaps once was enough.
