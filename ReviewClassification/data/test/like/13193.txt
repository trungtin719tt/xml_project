I was so excited to get my copy ofThe Awakeningfrom the library. My mom gave meThe Summoningfor Christmas and I was addicted. This only fed my addiction.I could not put this down. I was in classes trying to scrape together a few minutes to read a page or two. Especially when I got to the part where Derek turns into a werewolf and she's rubbing his back. I was like, "This is so cool! I have to keep reading!" But, as fate would have it, I could not. So I was totally excited to finish it.I think Derek is falling for Chloe. Really. He's so nice to her and he's so protective of her. Any mention of Simon makes him seem uncomfortable. I was really expecting them to kiss a time or two. Maybe in the next one.
