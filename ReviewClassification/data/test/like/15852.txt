Reading the last pages of this book was almost like living through a religious experience. All these characters never felt so real to me as they did in those last few lines. Having known them for the last ten years of my life (more or less) through the books and the movies, I thought they didn't have any secrets to me anymore, but I was oh so wrong. When I started readingSkagboys, I immediatly realized it was special. Renton, Sick Boy, Spud, Tommy, Alison, Hazel - they became more real than ever. I got to know how they werebefore- before heroin, despair, delusion, pain, fear, anger and betrayal. I listened to them, I started to understand them, I felt what they felt, and I learnt a lot about myself, too. Reaching the last pages led to the awareness that even if these characters lived in a completely different social/historical/cultural environment from the one I live in, I hadn't felt so connected with someone as I did with them in a very long time. I can't wait to re-readTrainspottingandPorno.
