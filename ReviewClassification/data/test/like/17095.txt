I really, really fucking hate to fish, but. Can you end a sentence with "but?" Did I write that correctly with the quotation marks? Do you see what I'm doing here? I'm using humor to avoid talking about my real feelings.When I first read this book I was on a cross-country flight. I was just finishing it when we began our descent. I was tearing up, and not because I was glad to see the sprawl of Los Angeles again. That last part when he is out fishing alone and everyone he knew and loved was dead...how can that not just rip you up?Years later I was watching the movie while I was entertaining friends at home. At the end of the film, my girlfriend at the time asked me if I was crying. Jesus, I thought she was going to kick my ass for that one. I told her I had something in my eye. I AM NOT A SISSY! I lift weights, god damn it!
