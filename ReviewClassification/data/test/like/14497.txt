I'm not going to lie: I read this book because I wanted to watch the film and I wanted to watch the film because Zac Efron is in it and I wanted to stare at Zac Efron for 90 minutes because I am shallow.I also wanted to read the book because I'm fascinated by the fact that so many of Nicholas Sparks' novels have been turned into films. Is he really that good or just he have an extraordinary agent?Well, I enjoyed this book. Between reading the blurb and seeing the trailer for the film, I knew exactly what I was in for and it delivered it well. I loved Zeus and Ben/Zeus/Logan's relationship. I feel that the ending and the way they resolved the whole Keith Clayton thing was a bit of a cop-out but at the same time I wouldn't have it any other way as I can now believe that Beth/Logan get their Happy Ever After.
