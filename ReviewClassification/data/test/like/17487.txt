The Drawing of Three, the second installment of King's epic fantasy series,The Dark Tower, blew me away.From start to finish, I was drawn intothese charactersand felt their 'worlds' growing around me.In this book we meet Eddie and Susannah, who will journey with Roland on his epic quest to reach the Dark Tower, and save the worlds.The format of this book, the way the different parts and chapters were organized, the way we are introduced to and learn about the new characters isbrilliant and classic King.I am very glad that I began this book directly after finishingThe Gunslingeras it literally picks up directly where that book left off. There are so many fine details in these books, I feel it is almost necessary to read them back-to-back in order to keep track of everything. As for me, I have already begun the next book in the series,The Waste Lands, and it is proving thus far to be equal in theepic natureof its prose to the first two books.My journey to the tower continues.....have you started yours?
