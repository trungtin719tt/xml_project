I have never, in all my reading years, sobbed quite so much or ached as deeply as I did while readingStill Alice. I am sobbed out, hollowed out.My beloved Nanna was only diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in the last year or so and thus, the reading of this novel took on an even more personal meaning for me.Lisa Genova's expert and exquisite depiction of Alzheimer's disease (in Alice Howland's case - early onset) is riveting, enthralling, and breathtakingly tragic. This book reads as a thriller; the tension only finally letting up for the harrowing sense of loss to set in.I am grief stricken for Alice, and for John and Anna and Tom and Lydia. For everything they ALL lost. And yet...love, always love, remains.*sob*My favourite quote from this immensely emotional story..."My yesterdays are disappearing, and my tomorrows are uncertain, so what do I live for? I live for each day. I live in the moment. Some tomorrow soon, I'll forget that I stood before you and gave this speech. But just because I'll forget it some tomorrow, doesn't mean that I didn't live every second of it today. I will forget today but that doesn't mean today doesn't matter"It breaks my heart to want to call this book "unforgettable"...*sob*
