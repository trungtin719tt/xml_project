4 starsAfter readingThe Awakening, I'm reminded of how much I loved this series when I read it a few years ago!This is such a nostalgic trip for me. You never forget the books that made you love reading. This may not have been my first series I had started, but it's one of the most enjoyable ones! :)I won't go much into detail about the plot, but I will share my thoughts and opinions on it. Spoiler free.Thoughts: I really liked this one! I know the second book in a trilogy may be a hit or miss with lots of people (I've read some good middle books and some bad ones). This one to me is a hit! It may not be for everyone, I'll admit, but I very much enjoyed it.We get a lot of more information surrounding what was going on at Lyle House and why the characters were there. Something is amiss with them and there may be a reason behind it. Once they find the answers, they must band together and seek refuge in order to survive.I'll say, for the most part, the book was a lot of talking along with some action. I know it may seem like filler, which it is, I'll admit. But it's that type of dialogue that keeps you interested and leaves you wanting to know what's going on. That, combined with some action and revelations, makes the book good! To me, at least.We also get more character growth with the characters. Especially with Chloe and her powers. I mean, she's a necromancer. That stuff is scary! Aside from Chloe, we see Derek, Simon, and Tori grow and develop as well! I really love them!VerdictEven though The Awakening has lots of dialogue, it's still a good book with lots of intrigue and character growth. If you really want to read this series, I would recommend it! You might enjoy it!Now all that's left isThe Reckoningand theDarkness Risingtrilogy!Thanks for reading my review!-Cesar
