You're at this bar in Amsterdam, sipping gin or whatever, this guy, wearing a suit, allegedly a lawyer, comes up to you and confesses everything about his life, You know he's weird at first, then you know he's a manipulative bastard, then you know he's a low-key sociopath, then you know he questions his own existence , then you know he's alone and depressed, then you know he's guilt ridden, then you know... anyway, you should've stood up and left, but you didn't. You sat there for two days, listening to this guy, prattling, basically about everything, you think of getting rid of him, but you won't, you didn't, you know something's coming up. When it's all done you wonder if you really exist.
