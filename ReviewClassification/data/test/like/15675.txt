I totally DID NOT want to read this book, but did for a book group. I loved it. It reminded me of my grandma who grew up AZ and the crazy, hard life that she had. I remember feeling like she was kind of strange, uneducated, and maybe a little scary because she was so tough... she had like 18 inch biceps-- we are talking strong. She was just so different from my other very educated,very classy, rich grandma that I was close to growing up. After reading this book I really wished I would have taken the time to get to know her and appreciate her stories that were truly unfathomable to me. It made me feel proud that I have her blood in mine... that maybe I can be a combination of both incredible grandma's, refined yet strong.
