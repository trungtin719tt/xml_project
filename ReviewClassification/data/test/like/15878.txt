This year I'm doing a Reading Challenge; so I have 26 books with specific subjects that I need to read.BOOK21: A book that will improve a specific area of your lifeI think every married couple should read this at least once.Do the quiz and know what Love Language your partner speaks.For the advice given in this book I giveChapmana five star rating.The writing on the other hand was not that good. He tends to "speak" down to the reader, making you think - I am not that stupid. Also he repeats himself A LOT!Reading this I think is the easy part: to practice whatChapmansuggest is the difficult part.
