I finished this book on my mother's 56th birthday, with a burst into tears,and I'm like running to her, hug her and told her that I love her. Charley's story are almost same like mine. Almost same. We had one great mom that their Principe is, what's the matter? I'm a mother. This is the books that made me wet the eyes in th train, this is the book that made me felt the purest love of mother. This is the book, that made me realize every times my mom stand up for me back then and I didn't do the same in return.As a daughter, I sometimes felt the same with charley. We had the times when we feel embarrass with our own mother. Teenage time of course, when we thinks, friends are cooler than mom, that we are mature enough to decide and please do not control our life. I have that time.We cant replaced our mother, they are masterpiece. This is the book that made me appreciate, the times we eat together now. Knowing the fact that, they're a people who wanted me so much in their lives, how could I, make it look as, such a waste, for one who got me as a child as whom I've become now. That's only the child's thought that they are a burden to their parents. Forgive yourselves is the key. I'll try my very best to make my parents proud, just like when I first registered to a boarding school and during my graduation day.I'll make it to you mom. Thank you Mitch, for the wonderful book. Every family, are a ghost story.
