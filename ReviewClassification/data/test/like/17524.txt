It would be a bit pointless to be reading Rice's books without having a notion of her journey through being catholic-&gt;agnostic-&gt;catholic-&gt;bitching about catholic church. Since last book of the series,The Tale of the Body Thief, Rice seems to be trying to write down and refine her thoughts on the way she perceives the catholics' religion, God, the Devil, and themoral obligationsunderlined by them. In the previous book this is somehow a secondary topic (barely touching the idea of the imperfect God and the learning Devil), the tale being more focused on Lestat's chance at redemption, at being human again and at finding out and really understanding what exactly it means to be human.However, on Memnoch, Rice goes full-crazy-bitch on our asses. She gets insanely ambitious with the bases she's trying to cover and basically redefines the whole catholic story of creation/evolution, giving it a twist more alike to what she thought of it at the time. On this story she's focusing even more on her idea of an imperfect, violent, careless God ("why does he let all the shitty things happen" is a recurring question) and a learning and caring Devil, him being the one out of the two that actually tries to "end suffering".Hell, Lestat is basically a secondary character from chapter 6-7 onto 21-22. But, to stop us from missing him, we do get some nice lines such as the Devil saying:Hell is where I straighten things out that He has made wrong. Hell is where I reintroduce a frame of mind that might have existed had suffering never destroyed it! Hell is where I teach men and women that they can be better than He isWith this out of the way, Rice does fail quite a bit on this one. Since the last book you get the feeling that she was starting to shift towards a more dialogue-driven plot (with huge 30 page chapters of a conversation between Lestat and someone else, something not common in say,The Queen of the Damned, that had a lot of narrator-action), and this book comes to reinforce that. When you pair this huge "dialogue" chapters with the unnecessarily long story of creation, and Lestat interrupting the Devil every couple lines to whine about something (he keeps on getting more and more beaten down by it all, more desperate, purposeless.. he basically becomes a deeper version of Louis), it ends up as a damn slow book.Again, her take on God and the Devil is an interesting one, and her portrayal of God reminded me to what Saramago wrote in hisThe Gospel According to Jesus Christ, but still, she could have maybe cut off the 30 page chapter describing heaven. Because, seriously, who cares what heaven would look like...There's light, everyone's happy, end chapter. Take us to hell, lady!But ah, the end of the book. If there's something Rice knows how to do is end a book. This one felt like she thought it would be the last book in the series, before she started reheating all the other vamps and telling their stories (and come on, they're not Lestat so again, who cares), and the final lines would've been great series-ending-lines:(view spoiler)[I want you to see me now. I want you to look at me, as I present myself, and as I swear to this tale, as I swear on every word of it, from my heart.I am the Vampire Lestat. This is what I saw.
