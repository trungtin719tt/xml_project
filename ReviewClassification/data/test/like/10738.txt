I love horse racing. I do not know why I am so enamored with it and I certainly do not follow it year round, but for the few months of the Triple Crown I cannot get enough. I research the horses, I research the jockeys, I read about previous winners, trainers, owners, anything.That is a long way to say that I knew I would love this book. There is no way that I wouldn't. What I wasn't prepared for his how much I was completely captivated by Seabiscuit's story.Seabiscuit was an amazing horse. But, more than that, he was a symbol to American's during the Great Depression that an underdog could overcome all odds to win. His jockey, Red Pollard, was a symbol that a guy with nothing could find his niche and rise to greatness.Hillenbrand introduces us to these two horse racing icons as well as Seabiscuit's owner, Charles Howard, and trainer, Tom Smith. She beautifully sets the stage with the history of horse racing in California, how each of the main players--including Seabiscuit--ended up at the same place at the same time to form a team, and she takes us through Seabiscuit's racing career.I know how Seabiscuit's races turned out, I researched them a lot several years ago when the movie with Toby McGuire came out, and yet I was on the edge of my seat for every race described. I literally cried when Seabiscuit didn't win, smiled when he did, and was amazed at his comebacks.I listened to this on audio and the narrator was very good. I liked that his reading the racing scenes felt like an old-timey radio broadcaster was announcing it.As much as I loved it, I don't think I would recommend it to people who are not at least interested in horse racing. There was a lot of description of the races and that could easily get redundant even if the non-racing parts of the story were also brilliant.Excellent choice for this month's tag!
