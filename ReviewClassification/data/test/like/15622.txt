I've been trying to think of how to review this book, but the only things that come to mind are metaphors for other senses... it's hue saturation is high, and it's gritty, bluesey and edgy the way Led Zeppelin is Metal.The plot tends towards the absurd, which allows the story to perform some philosophical acrobatics without giving into the pedantic or pretentious. Robbins tends to express these sorts of things in dichotomy: outlaws as opposed to criminals, activism as opposed to idealism, ideas versus objects. There's also a conversation between the author, writing this story (and he claims to have no power of intervention on the story, and he complains about it... often blaming the typewriter, which he painted red) and the story itself. And the color red is sort of a pivot point upon which the plot articulates itself.Borrowing from music again, the story is constructed like a fugue. A theme is introduced, usually in some primordial ooze fashion by the Red Remmington, though much of the main themes emerge in the first chapter. Then the variations commence. Redheads, Outlaws, Camels and Pyramids, social hierarchy, UFOs and aliens, The Moon, Ralph Nader (strawman and icon), Love and Sex (another dichotomy)... I'm missing some but whatever. Then, like an oozing fugue, or if you imagine watching cherry kool-aid disperse itself in a pitcher of water, without the aid of stirring, the themes disperse and comingle. They start out as clumps of powdered primordial kool-aid concentrate, swirl and drop tendrils into the water and eventually reach a state of equilibrium. I would say chaos, but it actually wasn't a chaotic story. Fugues are to chaos what outlaws are to criminals.I don't usually re-read books, but what's significant about this book didn't actually hit me until after I'd finished it... and i'm not sure what it was, so I have to go back.
