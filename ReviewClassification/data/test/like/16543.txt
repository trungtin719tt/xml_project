I honestly love this book more and more each time I read it. When I started my Dark Tower journey for the first time as a teen, I was constantly wondering through books 1-3 what had happened to Susan and Alain and Cuthbert and so when this book came along, I was provided with such a feeling of satisfaction.I know we don't get the full story on all three characters yet, but Susan was always the one I was most curious about as she's still so present in Roland's life many years later. And since it's been so long since I first read the series, reading this book was like discovering Susan's story for the first time and it was just as heartbreaking.It's really a treat to get a glimpse into the past that has shaped Roland into the man he is today. Without it, he really wouldn't be the Roland we've all come to grown and love so much and this series would be nowhere near as good.I firmly believe the flashback portion of this story is what makes this book so great, but that doesn't diminish the greatness of the other parts of the story! Because those were freaking fabulous as well and had me sitting on the edge of my seat, unable to read through the pages fast enough!
