I wrote this review from the perspective of an educator, so it might be more beneficial for teachers :)I feel bad saying this because of the dark, sad, content, but this was an amazing book! I typically read Go Ask Alice with my 11th/12th graders because of the detailed description of the main character's drug use and ultimate downward spiral. I think it is an important book to share because of the impressionable and exploratory stage my students are at. After reading Crank, I would not be opposed to reading it with my class instead of Go Ask Alice (maybe switch between the two). There are several reasons why I might do this, one being that Go Ask Alice seems dated to many of my students now. There are references and certain language used in the book that my students didn't understand. Another reason is the unique format in which Crank is written. Go Ask Alice is written in a pretty simple diary format, whereas Crank is written more like poems. I feel like my students would benefit from reading a novel in this type of format because it can be easily connected to: other poems about drug abuse, ELA poetry terms, songs about drug abuse, etc. Lastly, of recent, meth seems to have grown in popularity. It would be beneficial for my students to see how all consuming and life changing meth addiction can be.In saying all of this, I am not trying to downplay Go Ask Alice, and will still be using it in my classroom. It is a superbly realistic and terrifying book in its own right. But, if you need to work in some 'poetry' in your classroom, or need to switch up your books, then I recommend giving Crank a try.*If I do use this in my classroom I would be sending a letter home to parents beforehand. This book deals with weighty topics like: sex, drugs, abortion, family relationships, etc.
