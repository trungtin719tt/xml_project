This is one of the best crime thriller trilogies ever written and such a sad twist that Stieg Larsson didn't get to see the success his books had.A lot of people have seen the movies and understand the storyline but I would recommend reading the books as they offer much more depth to the characters with their personal demons and principles, particularly experienced by Lisbeth Salander. The plot is excellent and while each book can more or less stand on its own, there is the real expansive plot at play across the trilogy, where the past can never be laid to rest. The story is fast-paced and adventurous, and also brutal and upsetting.The job that Salander does just seems to suit her character so perfectly - slightly removed and introverted, yet highly capable and focused. I loved her she is high maintenance. Mikael Blomkvist, the journalist, is another wonderful character with his own flaws and like Lisbeth is highly motivated to uncover the truth.
