The Chronicles of Narnia are my favourite book series andThe Silver Chairstands as my favourite book within that series. There are several clear reasons for this in a story about redemption, belief and magical adventure and I shall attempt to explain them to you.I particularly love the plot and characters ofThe Silver Chair. The idea of a quest to find a missing prince is rather old hat, but the twist Lewis offers on that quest with Aslan providing new character Jill Pole several signs to recognise and remember in the search for this missing prince, is fascinating. Not only is this a perfect metaphor for the concept of belief and faith, but it also serves to provide an interesting dilemma in situations such as when Eustace and Jill decide to go into Castle Harfang due to the cold - rather than follow what the signs truly tell them to do.My favourite character in this novel is Puddleglum the Marsh Wiggle. He is the realistic, yet pessimistically cynical character who always finds something to grumble about. It is the earthy nature to this character that causes him to be so likeable as more than merely a reluctant hero, but as an unlikely hero. Yet in the end he is a true hero in how he sacrifices and does what is right, regardless of the cost.What else can I say about this novel without gushing all about it? I could say little to sway your opinion, other than to express repeatedly that I hold this novel in very high esteem and therefore encourage others to give it a chance (along with this series). There is plenty more depth in these books than many recognise and certainly far more than merely Christian themes and messages. There are universal messages and beauties to appeal to all.
