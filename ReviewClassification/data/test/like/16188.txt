I loved this book, and was moved to write by the string of two-star reviews. I was grabbed from the beginning by the fast pace and seamless world-building. I found it well-crafted, with a thumping fast adventure pace, well-placed mysteries, mis-directions and clues, and rare resorts to info-dumping to make the world come alive.The heroine is credible, far from omni-competent or a Mary Sue, as befits a young woman just striking out on her own professionally. She makes mistakes, learns from them, struggles to understand her colleagues and her circumstances.She reminds me a bit of David Weber's Honor Harrington (though *much* less Mary Sue-ish) in that her primary virtue is the engendering of loyalty - and yes, her supporting cast does outshine her. I see that as a strength, not a flaw, in series novels - but I like ensemble casts in books, TV and comics.If you're looking to be spoon-fed a simple narrative of a rugged-individualist action hero, look elsewhere. If you want a realistically-portrayed new kid on the block, in over her head and held up by colorful, secretive allies running their own agendas, in a convincing SF/paranormal alternate present - pick this up.And be prepared to see a sunrise or two, because you won't be able to put it down.
