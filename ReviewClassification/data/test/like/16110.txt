The Guardian by Nicholas Sparks is a combination of a love story and a thriller with a dog thrown in. The main character is Julie, a young widow who works at a salon and finally decides to date four years after her husband died. Her husband, Jim, left her a letter and arranged for her to get a Great Dane puppy in the event of his death which I thought was a pretty neat idea. The dog was his way of watching out for her. After the Prologue, this book poked along for me until about half way through when the psycho stalks her and she realizes she is in danger. I liked "The Guardian" because of the dog involved watching out for Julie.BEWARE: SPOILER AHEAD--STOP HERE IF YOU HAVEN'T READ THE BOOK!The ending was pretty intense but I didn't like that the dog died. I think Julie should have went for the gun when her dog grabbed the guys arm instead of letting him shoot her dog. I get that the dog was like a guardian angel and once Richard was dead, she'd have Mike and live happily ever after and the dog's "job" was done. I just think the dog could have lived too--I would have liked that ending better.
