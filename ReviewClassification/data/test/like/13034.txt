OK, here's the thing: P.L. Travers'sMary Poppinsis not Walt Disney'sMary Poppins.Weirdly, I love both versions equally, although Travers's portrayal of adult-child relationships is more accurate, I think. In the book, the kids clearly inhabit a fantasy world of which their parents are completely oblivious. Mary Poppins, an acid-tongued nanny, serves as a conduit to these fantasy worlds, which are often quite dangerous. Under Mary's protection, the Banks children explore some dark, glorious worlds, then are safely transported back home.Unlike Disney, Travers doesn't try to reconcile the kids to their parents. As far as she's concerned, they inhabit two different worlds, and shouldn't be encourged to mix them. And you know what? She's right.For the record, I do love the movieMary Poppins,with its gorgeous costumes and sets, not to mention brilliant performances by Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke. This is one of the rare cases, likeWalkabout, when a movie studio had a diametrically opposed idea of the author's vision, yet managed to create a work of art in the process. Compare and contrast the two and tell me what you think in a 20-page, double spaced essay, and don't forget the footnotes.
