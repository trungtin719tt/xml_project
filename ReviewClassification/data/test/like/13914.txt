The first time I read this book, I thought it was okay. Not the best Discworld, but okay.But each time I re-read it, I like it more.I mean, there is the Pern parody that is great. There is the kick ass daughter who inherits. There are the riffs on heroes.And yet, there is the fact that we are all Rincewind. I know, I know, I'm an American, so I should be Twoflower. But Rincewind is what we would all be if we were in LOTR.Old Review # 2The thing about this isn't the brilliant with and humor. It is the humanity all the way from curiosity to insurance fraud to hatred to loyalty.Now, if someone could invent the Luggage, I would be thrilled.Old ReviewRecently, there was (or currently still is) a scandel about the International Booker Prize. One of the judges resigned over the fact that it had been awarded toPhilip Roth. She then went public with her reasons which included the belief that Roth always wrote about the same thing.I don't know about that. I haven't read any Roth (hangs head in shame).I do know that Terry Pratchett, the world's greatest humanist, should win the bloody thing. As well as the regular Booker.And the Nobel Prize.And have statues and such set-up in his honor.Okay, maybe not the last one, but he at least deserves a place in Poet's Cornor when he mets his end (may it be a long time coming).The reason for this is simple.TERRY PRATCHETT IS AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!This book is the first in the Discworld series, and is one of the weakest. It is a jumble of things, most importantly poking fun at several fantasy tropes.More importantly, it introduces the reader to several long running characters. Here you will see the first appearance of the fastest runner ever. No, not that Bolt dude. It's Rincewind; he's sorta a wizard. Sorry, wizzard. Twoflower, the first tourist, makes his appearance, though it is hard not to see him as Sean Astiin now. The world's best politican makes an appearance. I know who should be president, we just gotta figure a way around the facts that (1) he's a figment of imagnation and (2) he's not an American. And Death, don't forget Death, makes an appearance as well.But more importantly, the book introduces the reader to the real star of the Disc. The Brad Pitt. The Denzel. The Viggo. Everyone's favorite hero! The most desired character in existence!The Luggage!Do you hear the sound of hunderds of little feet? Have all the birds disappered?It's the Luggage!Want the loyalty of a dog combined with the jaw power of one of those big meating dinosaurs?Get the Luggage.If Frodo had the Luggage, dropping the Ring in Mount Doom would've been a piece of cake.Which the Luggage would've eated after eating the trolls, goblins, and Ringwraiths.On a more serious note, Pratchett's start to the Discworld is not the best Discworld novel ever. He is still planning the world. Yet there is the genius and genus here. While not the everyman or alter ego that Commander Vimes will turn out to be, Rincewind does in a way represent every reader. We would all like to be the hero of the book, but in reality if confronted with Ringwraiths, dragons and such, most, if not all, of us would run very quickly the other way.That is what Rincewind does.Twoflower, as well, is part of us. The part that wishes to succumb simply to curiousity.Even at the begining, Pratchett is a wonderful humanist.
