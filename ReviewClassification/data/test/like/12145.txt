What stood out for me in this book? First, so many promises made. So many promises broken. The hunger of white settlers and greedy men interested in the Indians' lands, and later, their reservation lands. It saddens the heart to read all that was done, the lies spoken, and the killing committed to obtain these lands.Second,the destruction of the buffalo. Their carcases left to rot on the open plains angers the soul at the waste. All committed to (1) furnish the commercial markets and (2) destroy the Indians' way of life. Thank goodness someone had the foresight to save some herds.I liked how Mr. Brown provided timelines and original, Native American speeches. It put the heavy, researched chapters in perspective. This would be my third point of what stands out in this book for me.Fourth and final point is the fear on both sides. The soldiers' fears of uprisings and the power of Native American leaders. The Native Americans' fears of imprisonment, and loss of their way of life and land. Fear make men react in dangerous ways, but in this instances, loss of life and retaliation for wrongs done on both sides.Dee Brown has written a well, researched account of the Western Native Americans. One of promises, lies, death, and hopelessness. The great wrong committed against Native Americans is one as grieves as the sins against the Black Americans.History has its travails. It is covered in blood. It is also covered in knowledge and glory. Where there is human kind, each side of history suffers and succeeds. This book is both tragic and brave. Tragic because of the Native Americans suffering. Brave because of the many, many times Native Americans endured and hoped for the same or a better way of life.
