I'm mad at myself because I wanted to read the first of the Narnia series before reading this one for class, but I didn't quite make it.I loved this story because I love Lucy and Aslan and Caspian, but there were a lot of side characters who I didn't care much about and the villain in this book wasn't so interesting. Nevertheless, a muuuuch easier read than Lord of the Rings!!
