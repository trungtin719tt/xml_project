Yay! I liked this book!! :PThings I liked...-I thought the author did a wonderful job of includingmostof the (20) girls in all the dialogue and I felt I got to know them all fairly well! :) (I feel like I would be really bad at that though XDD)-I liked Esa's character the most, I think! I liked Marda and Britta too though.-And Peder. And Doter. I guess I just liked their whole family XD-I appreciated that the bandit scene wasn't super cheesy or anything and that they didn't get away or that the villagers didn't beat them like the last round of bandits. I think that added to the story!Things I didn't like...-Though I liked Marda's character, I think she could have had a little more dialogue and action in the story. Though I guess she did(view spoiler)[break her leg(hide spoiler)]-I think Olana gave up a little too easy in some different things... maybe that's her weakness.-In the first part of the book, I didn't really like Miri's Pa's chracter. A house with closed shutters describes him well!- I felt like Miri's character went up and down and up and down. Like she cared about Peder and then she would love to be married to the prince and that was her biggest dream. She was very defensive in front of Olana, but meek at some points too. And other things like that. It just bugged me a little. But not enough to not enjoy the story ;)All in all, I loved reading Princess Academy! My rating is 5 stars!
