This a very amazing tale about a boy who is in love with science, he would ask just about any question to keep his mind buzzing with ideas and theories, however his dad has lost all will to experiment and try new things (although he's a scientist himself) because of a tragedy that occurred to the boy's mom in which she lost her life.The boy jokes about changing his dad's brain but little does he know that's exactly what happens next when he's mind travels through a wormhole and ends up in the Brainiverse, the characters and the setting of this book are truly unique and very diverse, the plot is filled with fiction mixed with real brain concepts and puts everything into perspective from both fiction and reality.Note:I received a digital copy of this title for an unbiased opinion and reviewing purposes.
