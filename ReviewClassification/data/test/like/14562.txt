Book 1 of 2019! I can't believe I'd never read this before. I was inspired by @hardcoverheartsblog (in Instagram) to readalong on January 1, but had to download the audio to play along.I knew this was an epistolary account between a reader and someone at a bookstore, but I had a lot of misconceptions:1. This is a romance2. The letters are between two people3. Everyone lives in the UK4. This is a novel (no!)It's a short, enjoyable read about books and readers, so in that vein it is somewhat of a love story. And another surprise - most of the books discussed are not fiction either! And there is a lot of meat.And actually I loved this in audio, with multiple narrators reading for the different letter writers.
