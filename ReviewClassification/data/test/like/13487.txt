One of the best series sequels ever! Sylvia Day has outdone herself with Reflected in You. Best of the Best!In Reflected in You, Gideon Cross develops into a dangerously powerful and dark alpha male that takes us on an emotionally charged ride with Eva. Sylvia Day could have written Gideon as the popular generic cliche - the sexy, rich "Christian Grey" character with lots of power and kink, and we probably would have loved it, BUT SHE DIDN'T.Gideon Cross kicks Christian Grey's ass.He's so loving one minute, and disconnected and dark the next, that I couldn't predict what was coming up next. His controlling hot/cold behavior made me feel like Eva throughout the story: uncertain, hot, emotional, happy, worried, sad, full of angst and gutted. All I wanted was a little crumb from Gideon, something to make me believe in him again. The story just got better and better and by the time I read the last chapter, everything made perfect sense and I didn't want it to end.Reflected in You is one of my top ten faves of 2012. Loved it!
