I actually give this a 4.5, but it was insulting for this magnificent book to be with te rest of the 4 star ones. This book hasn't reached its full potential, due to the "action" only starting over 50% of the book, but I loved it anyway.I'll definitely change my rating through time, because right now I feel fluffy inside (I just finished the book) and I NEED MORE.I believe this series will become a favorite of mine!
