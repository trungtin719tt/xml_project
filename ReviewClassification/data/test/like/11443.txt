Holy crow! This book had me sad crying and happy crying!I loved this ending to the trilogy. Although, there was a lot of sadness and worry throughout the book I was just hoping and praying it was going to end well. In a sense it did, but it's complicated.They go to war, or I should say are attacked and they are trying to get help from Antarctica and things are all kinds of crazy and scary.Some things are going on with little Eden and with Day. I was so worried. I love little Eden =)June is the Princeps-Elect and working closely with Elector Anden. But they all come together when they have nothing else. Enemies become allies and the world eventually becomes a better place.And I have to say I was worried for Ollie through the whole book, but guess what? He made it and I don't care if that's a spoiler because animals living are good spoilers =)Anyway, I'm so happy with this trilogy and this book in particular! I hate that I waited so long to read it, but don't we say that about so many books we own . . .MY BLOG:Melissa Martin's Reading List
