Thriller A Thon: Revisit an author or book.Jar of Death Pick # 11(7th finished)I tried to read this book years ago but after about 50 pages I lost interest. I broke my rule in this case because I watched the movie first. I have seen every Leonardo DiCaprio movie so I just decided to see the movie and then eventually get around to the book.Flash Forward 10 years I finally read the book!First can we all agree that Shutter Island is a great name for a spooky book.Shutter Island takes place on Shutter Island which houses the Ashecliff Hospital for the Criminally Insane, in 1954. A U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels comes to the island to investigate the disappearance of a patient. While there he quickly comes to believe that all is not as it seems.Since I had already watched the movie I knew the big twist but that didn't dampen my enjoyment of the book(I guessed it when I saw the movie). Shutter Island is the kind of book that could easily have started with "It was a dark and stormy night". The atmosphere of the book was super eerie and it helped that yesterday which is when I read the bulk of this book it was dark and rainy outside.I had fun reading this book and I can't wait to rewatch the movie.
