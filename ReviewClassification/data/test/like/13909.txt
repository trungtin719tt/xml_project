Back to where it all began. Ithinkthis is my third time reading this, but that does show how long ago my introduction to this series was. I have a huge affection for this entire series and the author as a human being, but I'm actually quite glad that I wasn't a more sophisticated reader when I was first exposed to this. If this had been my first exposure to his work today, I'm not sure I would have continued with them.In summary, the Discworld experiences its first tourist, Twoflower, from the incredibly rich Counterweight Continent. Along with his Luggage and magic picture-taking box Twoflower encounters the wizard Rincewind who gets recruited as his guide to the wonders of the Discworld. From there, adventures ensue in the city of Ankh-Morpork, the Temple of the Sender of Eight, a hive of Dragonriders and eventually the edge of the Discworld itself.The first of the series is very much a satire of the whole fantasy field. Ankh-Morpork is a very thinly veiled Lankhmar (complete with Bravd and the Weasel). The barbarians that Rincewind and Twoflower meet are lifted straight from Robert E. Howard. The Dragonriders are a homage to Pern and Boris Vallejo. And Tolkien and RPG references abound as well. The book even has the classic "fix-up" novel structure where a novel is made up of linked stories that were published in pulp magazines separately.The book does what it intends to do: satire the fantasy field of the time. Pratchett's innate creativity shines through though and there are plenty of original creations that are the seeds of the brilliance of later Discworld novels, but this is clearly very early. The Patrician of Ankh-Morpork is introduced here, but he is just Generic Shrewd Ruler, rather than the razor-sharp mastercrafter of civilization that he is in later books. Death shows up as well, and has something of the dry wit of later books, but he's vaguely petulant rather than the character who can say "LORD, WHAT CAN THE HARVEST HOPE FOR, IF NOT FOR THE CARE OF THE REAPER MAN?"Pratchett also becomes a great novelist in structural terms with great attention to pace and plot. That's not in evidence here, and I felt it was a bit of a slog to get through.
