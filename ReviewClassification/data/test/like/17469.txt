I have read some 15 years ago The Stand by Stephen King. There are some parallels that could be drawn between that story and Swan Song. Both novels are dealing with the collapse of civilization following an apocalyptic event (virus infection in one case, nuclear war in the second) , both are set in the North American Midwest and follow the struggles of scattered bands of survivors. And both books feature supernatural beings as avatars of the forces of Good and Evil fighting for supremacy.Stephen King might be the better writer in terms of character development and prose, but I think The Stand came unglued in the final third and fizzled out in a confusing , unconvincing finale. Not so with Swan Song. Robert McCammon has a much better control of the overall plot, even if his characters felt less subtle and rather unidimensional. The narrative drive sagged a little in the middle of the story, but the action picked up by the end into a real page turner.Swan Song is a much darker tale than The Stand, and Robert McCammon managed an impressive rendering of the destruction wrecked on the landscape and on the human psyche. The battle between the forces of good and evil is slightly too Bible flavored for my tastes and heavy handed in treatment with a too clear separation between the two sides and with little grey areas, but the author has confirmed his natural born storyteller credentials that have impressed me in "The Wolf's Hour". His action scenes have the cinematic feel of a high octane thriller, and I think his books would translate well into this medium.[edit for spelling]
