3.5 starsWell, this was indeed quite lovely. I had a lot of fun reading this book, and it was the perfect read at the perfect time, since I am still emotionally scarred byCaptive Prince.Ruby Red is what I would recommend if you're in a reading slump and trying to get out of it, if you are stressed and need something quick and funny to read or if, like me, you've just finished reading an emotionally challenging book. At first I wasn't really fond of the writing, since it's extremely simplistic (but again, it's a translation. I usually try to avoid translated books, but there's no way I would be able to read an entire novel in German), but I also think it's somehow... appropriate. It feels exactly like being inside a teenager's head.Gwyneth is a sixteen-year-old girl from a family of time travelers, and she's wonderfully normal. She goes to school, has an amazing best friend, Lesley (who would deserve a paragraph of her own, because she isthatamazing) and together they do the most ordinary things. They watch movies, make friends, sometimes crush on boys. It was so refreshing to have a normal girl as a main character - not an outsider, not a special snowflake who was oh-so-different from everybody else. Gwyneth is funny and sometimes endearingly awkward, and she always stands up for herself. I loved not only her relationship with Lesley (really, female friendships in books make me happy) but also the one she had with her family. She was very affectionate towards her younger siblings, and I adore books in which the main character has a large family and has to deal not only with their parents and siblings, but also with a spiteful aunt, an icy-cold grandmother and a know-it-all cousin. Gwyneth is not supposed to be special. She's supposed to live an ordinary life, leaving the spotlight to her cousin, Charlotte, who should be the one carrying the time travel gene (a pretty confusing theory, if you ask me; we're not given a lot of explanations. Though from now on I won't ever be able to read about Newton again without grinning and thinking about Gwyneth.) Instead, against all expectations, it's Gwyneth herself who is able to travel backwards in time.Now, for a time travel book, theactualtime travel started to happen pretty late. I was expecting days-long journeys back to the 1800s, but Gwyneth never stays in the past for more than a couple of hours (though the few times she does go back in time, a lot of exciting things happen!) However, she may be the last time traveler, but she's not the only one. Gideon De Villiers is heir to an ancient family of time travelers, and Gwyneth's new companion. He's full of himself and often annoying - so, yes, of course I loved him. The thing about Gideon is that he's unexpectedly kind, and actually cares about Gwyneth, but also has his own goals. The two of them had the funniest banter, and I think he makes a great love interest.The book has a lot of other cool fantasy elements as well, like enigmatic visions of the future, a secret society of time travelers and, last but not least, ghosts. Gwyneth has been able to see ghosts, gargoyles, demons and all kinds of otherworldly creatures since she was a child, which was a very interesting detail about her.Long story short, Ruby Red is pure entertainment. The writing is a bit too simplistic and sometimes the book reads almost like a middle grade novel - I'm not sure if that's because of the writing itself or because Gwyneth is still a kid, after all - but I enjoyed it immensely. It's funny and fast-paced with wonderful characters, and I wholeheartedly recommend it.
