Native Son is a good novel with a compelling story about the racial division in America society. When I began reading the novel I contemplated that it was an hideous portrayal of African Americans; structuring them as murderers. However, upon reading the last book ,Fate, I began to understand Wright's gist on the racial biases. He uses Bigger to represent the predicament of all blacks during his time by exploring racism and its results on the oppressed. Bigger, the oppressed, does not see whites as human but rather as racists who intend only to restrict him from doing the things he wants to do. This idea or blindness created in him hate, fear, and anger which resulted in the crimes he committed in the first and second book. Nevertheless, I've come to sympathize with Bigger upon hearing the motives behind his actions. To me, Bigger is nothing but the creation of white dominated society. The hate and isolation that the whites has situated in him has transformed him into a coldhearted and violent person. He felt that whites did not see him as an individual with his own thoughts and feelings; they controlled how he should live. To avoid this fate, Bigger uses violence as the only alternative to evade submission to white society. Thus, I can't honestly say I liked Native son; it is not a book one enjoys due to the extreme unfairness in Bigger's trial. Rather it is a book that helps one understand the appalling ways that society's racial discriminations could shape a person. Richard Wright did a phenomenal job showing this through Bigger's character in Native Son.
