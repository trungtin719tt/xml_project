Shutter Islandisn't as good asMystic River, which I read just before this.Mystic Riveris an entire neighborhood of fleshed out characters that propelled its tragic plot.Shutter Islandisn't so three dimensional. What it does have going for it is a taut plot full of suspense and mystery. This is a puzzle novel. Not a novel puzzle likeThe Davinci Codewhere the puzzle is the thing and everything else is secondary. The puzzles of a first-rate thriller exist not as the primary purpose but to pull you into the characters and reveal the actual mystery and meaning of the novel.Shutter Islandisn't so much a Who-dunnit as much as a What-the-hell-is-happening. The central plot is about a FBI agent who is attempting to find a missing patient at a mental hospital for the criminally insane in the 1950s. Yet this is one of those novel where nothing is as it seems. Personally, I found the clues a little to easy and guessed the twist in about 100 pages. Anyone who digs word games probably will do the same. However by then, I was hooked on the main protagonist, Teddy Daniels and his slightly too clever sidekick, Chuck Aule (say the name fast). Even if you guess the ending, the journey itself is full of detours and traps that will keep you involved. As someone who worked in mental health facilities, I was also fascinated by the depiction of mental health treatment in the 50s. Over-all I found this novel to be an highly exhilarating ride full of dips and turns.
