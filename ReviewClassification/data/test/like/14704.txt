First of all, I want to take the time to express what a fils de pute, I think Biff (Blake) is. They help him out at the risk all of their lives and the connard betrays them. That's low on soo many levels, not that I expected much from him given his actions in the past, but still. Loved a lot of things about this book, but the ending was not one of them...at all. I'm really happy Dawson and Beth found each other again but I keep thinking, poor Daemon must be going through hell right now after losing Katy to the Arum. The ending practically wrecked me.. I think I'm gonna read a few different books before I pick up the 4th one to this series, because if anything like this happens in the 4th book I think I will be emotionally scarred for life.
