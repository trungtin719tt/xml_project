Old review when the prospective title was Shur'tugal:Title fail. Brisingr was hard enough, this is suicide. Only the hardcore fans (like me) will even bother to learn how to pronounce the title. "Empire" would have been a great title.New review:"Inheritance" is a GREAT title :) First of all, it's a pronounceable, English word, and second, it will actually help us remember what the proper name of the series is! lol And the cover is just Gorgeous! :)Looking forward to reading it :)____________Read it, loved it. Hope we get to see more of the dragons! There is still a lot of story to be told!
