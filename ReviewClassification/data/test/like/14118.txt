How am I to put all the pain of this novel into a review?The pain of the suffering characters? The pain of the reader suffering with them? There were moments when I felt I couldn't take it anymore, when the carefully built puzzle added another piece to the beautifully decorated and carefully furnished hellscape.What makes you able to talk about that kind of pain, then, I could ask, following the path of Quentin and Shreve, the two dialogue partners who preside over the story in the story, trying to carve out truth in the muddle of prejudice, pride, hatred and occasional passion (mostly unaccompanied by love)?Anger, I'd say.Anger at the fact that a monster like Sutpen can walk the earth, admired as a godlike creature by the people who share his racist and misogynist revenge and entitlement thinking. Anger that he has the power to put children into the world - to CREATE like an evil mirror of the Creator of the Southern religion - whose only purpose is for his "glory and honour" to be perpetuated in a pure, male line. Female descendants don't count, and neither do sons if they have any trace of African American ancestry. Some women are just about good enough to give pleasure if the occasion arises, but their children are not even good enough to acknowledge their existence in front of the world.Anger drove me, and one quote broke my heart: "So it's the miscegenation, not the incest, which you can't bear?".As did the fate of Milly Jones and her baby GIRL! A human being, for Goodness Sake. No, not a vessel of Sutpen genes lacking y-chromosomes! Sutpen differs from his biblical source in that his heart is not broken like that of David confronted with Absalom's death. He is merely offended in his right to perpetuate his meaningless string of genes in a line of white-only male gorillas.He pushed one old man over the edge and found his end in the most suitable way. His curse lives on, and on, and on, way beyond the magnetic closing lines, answering the question put to Quentin, why he hates the South:"I dont hate it he thought, panting in the cold air, the iron New England dark; I dont. I dont! I dont hate it! I dont hate it!"Repeating the mantra in the same way a desperately caring person says: "I don't care, I don't care, I don't care!"But we do, and therefore books like this hurt. A lot.
