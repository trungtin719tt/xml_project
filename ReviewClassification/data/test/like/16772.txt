If you have not read this series... please do! I am so very in love with it!This installment was probably my favorite of the three.I think one of my favorite parts of reading a series is watching the characters develop. And The Iron Fey series was an excellent example of that. Ash proved himself to be more than an ice cold heart, Puck's incessant mischief even gives way to seriousness and Meghan, once a insecure school girl, find courage beyond her means. It was powerful, I even cried... goosebumps and everything.Meghan, girlfriend.... you kicked some butt, and I totally respect you for it.Besides the characters, the story itself was also completely encompassing. Within the first few pages, I was swept up, into this stunning world that Julie has created and I didn't want to leave. Julie's writing is so easy to read, and her imagery, the creatures in this world.... everything is just so very imaginative. I'm pleasantly surprised every time I read one of her novels. And the love story reaches it's pinnacle.... and can I just say.. WOW... and awwww.... and please, oh please, oh please! and the most important reaction: YOU'RE KILLING ME!I honestly can't say enough good things about these books... and I wish I was a little more eloquent, so that I could write a review worthy of it's awesomeness... but you'll have to settle with this dear readers.An exciting ending to a truly magnificent series! It was everything I could have wanted and more.(I'm DYING to read Ash's story... THE IRON KNIGHT!!)
