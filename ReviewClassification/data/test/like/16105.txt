Nicholas Sparks did an awesome job of moving the story along in this book, which is hard to do when tackling a thriller AND romance in the same novel. There was a delicate balance between the action/drama side of the story and the typical love story and I'm impressed with the attention to detail. I'd love to see this adapted into a movie!
