In 1944, at the age of fifteen, Elie Wiesel, his parents and three sisters, were transported from Sighet to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland. Upon arriving they were ordered, "men to the left, women to the right". Elie would never see his mother and younger sister Sarah again. What followed was two years of living hell, two years of "night".What it was like in a concentration camp, what it was like for Elie and his father, can not be put into words that would be adequate to describe the reality. But Elie's account is graphic enough to make us wonder how anyone could have survived this horror. Most didn't; Elie's mother and youngest sister Sarah didn't; and Elie's father, who he tried to look after, tried to keep alive, didn't. Elie and his father survived a death march in the dead of winter from Auschwitz to Buchenwald where his father finally succumbed to illness and beatings. In the spring of 1945 the American Army arrived to liberate the camp and end the "night", or the nightmare.This book is hard to read, as are most books on this horror of the 20th century, but this is first hand account and reminds us of what human ignorance, hatred, and bigotry are capable of, and don't think for one minute it could never happen again because it can.Elie's two older sisters, Hilda and Bea, both survived the concentration camps and all were later reunited. In 1986 Elie Wiesel was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.
