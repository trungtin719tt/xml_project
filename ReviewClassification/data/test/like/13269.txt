3.5-Really strong 'conclusion' to the series, because according to the author, "The Reckoning is the last book in the trilogy, not the last in the series. It only wraps up the major plotline introduced in The Summoning. It is not intended to tie off every minor plot thread and retire the characters". Not sure how I feel about that, but I think there is some potential here and I trust this author enough to go with it (for now). Chloe and Derek are adorable, and I always enjoy Armstong's characterizations. Really liked the little shout out to Elena et al, I think an eventual meeting with the 'Bitten' pack is inevitable for Derek, and I look forward to seeing what she does with that.My one slight pet peeve is that characters seem to have a hard time finishing their sentences in this book, got very distracting at some points for me.
