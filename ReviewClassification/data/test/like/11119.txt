In this absorbing world Patrick Ness created, only men exist. All of the men can hear each other's thoughts, and these thoughts are called noise. When you turn 14 you become a man, and the anticipation for this is astounding.Todd Hewitt is about to become a man. He was told that there are no woman, because they were all killed off. One day, when he's out with his dog, Manchee, he finds a spot where there is no noise. Surely, he thinks, this is impossible. Soon he is confused further, when his parents tell him he must leave his town, Prentisstown, and venture to a new town. He never thought other towns existed.I felt that this book picked up really quickly, and will demand your attention, with action and suspense that keep you constantly guessing.The adventure in this book is amazing. Todd's being chased, he's learning new things every minute, and finding out about all of the untruths he's been grown up to believe. The plot is moves so quickly, but there are a few slow parts that I struggled through. Not many, though.The ideas here are very creative, especially in regards to the noise. It was interesting to see what animals would have to say (not much of interest, actually) and how differently the various characters Todd encounters along his journey have dealt with the problem of broadcasting their thoughts.As far as characters go, it was easy to feel for them, because they felt very real. Todd has flaws that make him more loveable in my opinion. Manchee, his dog is another fun character that made me laugh.The concept of this book was just so unique. The writing is well done, despite the fact that Todd's thoughts were often not grammatically correct. It was annoying reading through them in the very beginning, but then it get's quite easier to read after a few pages. I cruised through this book thinking it was going to be rated 4 stars...until the ending. The narrative is dark, but the ending is even darker and, it's an emotional sucker punch. The book has one brilliant cliff-hanger ending that will make you want to immediately get book two.This book truly impressed me. Recommended to all action, adventure, dystopian lovers.
