Absolutely amazing!Finished Pandemonium 10 minutes ago!I was extremely lucky to get an advanced copy of Pandemonium. And forgive me for a MINOR spoiler but as I was looking at the "reviews" that people have posted about their anticipation for the thrilling sequel and couldn't help but chuckle about your fears of what may happen with Lena, some were dead on!That being said when you rush to your local Barnes and Noble to pick up your copy(that you should have pre-ordered)please begin with an open mind. If you picked up the beautiful special edition of Delirium you got the first chapter of Pandemonium. The first few chapters for me were akin with a horrible break-up. It is heart-wrenching to watch Lena in this state. Like Delirium there is few significant characters introduced and its wonderful! I love when I pick up a book and don't have to remember the name of every single person in region*cough* Twilight Saga *cough*The complete anonymity of everyone but Lena a handful of secondary characters forces you to focus solely on Lena's voice.I am having a total fan girl moment and am dying to tell you all about Raven,Julian and what happens so I'm going to stop. Be prepared my fellow Invalids for we are all about to be re-infected by the deliria and I know for damn sure that I do not want to be cured!Thank you Lauren Oliver for creating a world so beautiful and enchanting that reality dulls in comparison in the absolute best way!
