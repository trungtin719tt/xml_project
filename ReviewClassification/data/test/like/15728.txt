This was pretty much the book that got me hooked on reading because I used to hate it. I know, I know, Hate reading? how is that possible? The truth is, When you're eight or nine reading doesn't normally sound as good as watching a cartoon. But one glorious day I somehow stumbled across a cartoon of Redwall, and I LOVED it! I liked it so much that when the cartoon was over I had to know more about this amazing world, but I didn't have a way of watching the other movies so I was forced to do something I hated, reading. I got a copy of Redwall and I read it, and I read the next one, and the next one, and the next and the next one and so on. As I read my skill at reading improved, it was easier, I began to like it more. So I started reading more books such as The Series Of Unfortunate Events, Inkheart, Harry Potter, etc. And before I knew it I was wanting to read more, I was wanting to experience more, I was like a starving T-Rex let loose on a herd of unsuspecting herbivores! Ok, maybe not a T-Rex but you get the idea. I was submersed in this amazing world and instead of just seeing boring stacks of compressed paper I saw gateways into a realm of endless possibilities, and it was all thanks to this book. This simple tale of talking mice and evil rats, of snakes and stoats and adventure! And for that, I am grateful.
