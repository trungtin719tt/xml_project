"For instance, if Jesus Christ had died in prison, with no one watching and with no one there to mourn or torture him, would we be saved?With all due respect....the biggest factor that makes you a saint is the amount of press coverage you get.The same as if a tree falls in the forest and no one is there to hear it, you realize, if no one had been there to witness the agony of Christ, would we be saved?The key to salvation is how much attention you get."This is the best Chuck Palahniuk book.Or not. I think it's Fight Club. The anarchic, nihilistic Fight Club that screws into you the idea that you are not a sacred unique snowflake of special unique specialness.Hmm. No. I'm pretty sure it's Choke. Choke digs into the topic of behavioral manifestations of things we learn and we do. Choke is the best Chuck Palahniuk book.But Survivor is complex, well-researched, suspenseful, and insightful. It's the best, I swear.But when I think about Diary, I'm just not sure. Diary greatly encompasses every insights about pain and suffering. So no doubt it's actually the best one as far as I can recall.Oooops, I think I mean Lullaby. Lullaby progresses slightly and the protagonist develops into someone I root for. Lullaby is magically realistic with a punch on how powerful words are.Oh shit I forgot the genius of Rant. The mind-blowing sci-fi that it is. Time travel and shit. As in mind: blown. Boom kaboom. It's the best, believe me.But Invisible Monsters is so much feels, twisted, deliciously nihilistic. It's the best one, cross my heart.You can safely say that I'm torn.Whatever book (included above) I read or reread the latest, it's gonna be the best Chuck Palahniuk book for me.
