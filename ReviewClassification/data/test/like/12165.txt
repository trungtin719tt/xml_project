This is a children's book. While I enjoyed the story and thought it was well written for the age group intended, I'm not entirely sure kids would like this story. It is sad, which is all fine, but it addresses some adult issues that many kids wouldn't relate to.My older children read this in elementary school, and it didn't grab them....maybe because they were boys, or maybe it was just over their heads..... I'm not exactly sure. But still 4 stars for me, as an adult.
