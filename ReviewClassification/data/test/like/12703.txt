"A true freak cannot be made. A true freak must be born."When times were looking tough, Al and Lil Binewski used their ingenuity, along with some poisons and chemicals, to come up with a way to keep their traveling Carnival alive, breed their own main attractions. First came Arturo, born with flippers for limbs, better known as Arty the Aqua Boy. Then Iphy and Elly, conjoined at the waist who draw in the crowds with their song and dance numbers. Next was Olympia the albino hunchback dwarf, not special enough to warrant her own show but unique enough to keep around to help behind the scenes and finally came Chick. Sweet, cherubic and utterly normal - on the outside at least. Told through the voice of Oly, we follow the rise and fall of the Binewski clan.My God, what a wild ride! Jealousy, greed, murder, cultism, violence, love, loss, revenge... there isn't much this book doesn't cover. Katherine Dunn does a beautiful job of describing the freakish surface details of her characters and the whole Carnival life while at the same time making each of them utterly human and easily relatable on the inside. This is simply a coming-of-age story revolving around a family in a very unique situation and is beautiful and horrifying and deeply moving all at once.
