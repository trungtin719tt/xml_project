I don't remember the first time I read this book. I could have been ten years old, I could have been twelve or fifteen years old. I also cannot tell you how many times I have checked this book out from various libraries, just to re-read the Logan's all over again.But what I can tell you is that, hands down, this is one of the most life changing books I have ever read and the lessons I have taken from this book (and its subsequent books) are indescribable. This family, how they are strong and right during a time when its easier NOT to be strong and right. Words cannot explain how formative this book was to me as a youth and continues to be to me as an adult."Baby, we have no choice of what color we're born or who our parents are or whether we're rich or poor. What we do have is some choice over what we make of our lives once we're here." Mama cupped my face in her hands. "And I pray to God you'll make the best of yours."
