A trashy treasure of a chick lit novel.I'm so guilty..... For three things.1. I liked how melodramatic this horrible written novel was.2. I could feel my brain cells dwindling as I read it.3. I stayed up for nights reading this book.Errrr.........I'm very embarrassed but I'll give this a five, for enjoying it 100% percent , all the way to the sleazy cliche oversexed men to the dull cliche girls. I like it! Not for the literary stand -point of the novel because weallknow there isn't any in this book. Just for a good time, this novel is like the boyfriend with the hot face who can't hold a conversation to save his life. I think that this might have been one of the most racy novels of the 60s, which is just a pure laugh! I felt myself giggling at the book."Oh my gosh sex to get ahead , pretty faces and pills! - how taboo for it's time". I have a thing for "vintage" novels with female characters and I couldn't keep my hands off this novel when I saw it perched on the shelf. Hollywood secrets, actresses, catty women, perfumes and lipsticks - if that sounds interesting to you, I would advise you to check out this book.
