Copy provided by the author in exchange for an honest review.Brainwalker was a fantastic read full of twists and turns that kept me hooked from start to finish. The reader follows a young boy, Bernard, on an incredible journey into the mind of his father. After stepping into a wormhole at his fathers job, he is catapulted into his fathers brain. There he meets Basilides, Adhista, Philemone, and many more wild characters, who have been occupying his father's brain from the beginning of time. The people are called Holons and the two sides of the brain, Reezon and Intuit end up in a battle for Energeia, the powerful mixture that keeps the neurons alive.There is so much action and scientific research in this book. I really enjoyed reading about the characters. I do think that this would be a fantastic book for a reluctant learner who enjoys stories. Although everything was told in a way that fit with the story, it outlined what the brain is really like and could easily be translated into terms that would teach a kid all about the inner workings of the brain. I would read this to my kids as a read aloud as they get older.Overall, the writing style was great and kept me interested the whole way through. The voice of the story was captivating and intriguing. I would recommend this book to the sci-fi lover and am giving it a 4-star review!
