Man, I finished this book in like just over 24 hours, and IM ON A ROLL! I loved this book so much! It made me cry, it made me laugh, and then it made me want to slam my head into the wall, because sometimes things don't turn out the way you want them to turn out, with memorable twists and turns and it just leaves you going.. UGHHH.but, I'm starting the next books right away.... That is after I get some sleep.
