I was still hurting for Delirium- hurting because I still couldn't and wouldn't accept that Alex is gone. It was also very painful reading the aftermath of Alex's loss to Lena as she tries to accept her new life and become part of the resistance. I admire her courage and strength for accepting very challenging tasks assigned to her by Raven especially when she saves Julian from his execution. Despite herself and her love for Alex, I understand why she has to let go and give her heart to Julian. But what devastated me the most was how when Lena was already ready to give her love to Julian, Alex suddenly reappears warning Julian not to believe Lena. Man!!! That is so unfair!!! This is one super twisted cliffhanger that will make the reader restless till the finale arrives.
