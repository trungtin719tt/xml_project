A super quick read at only 70 pages or so, this is a collection of seven short stories written in 1892 by Charlotte Perkins Gilman, a utopian feminist ahead of her time. The themes are as relevant today as back then. The Yellow Wallpaper is the most popular, and has a mildly suspenseful feel. The others had quite a bit of humor, attitude, and an outspokenness on gender issues that would have been surprising for the times.My favorites were:The Yellow Wallpaper(mental illness &amp; the 'resting cure', repression of a woman's creativity and self-expression)Three Thanksgivings(female self-sufficiency, expectations of female role)Making a Change(motherhood liberation - working out of the home)A quick, insightful, and worthwhile read.
