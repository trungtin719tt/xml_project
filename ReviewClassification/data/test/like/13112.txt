The Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants is a novel I really should have read back in high school!I found this book surprisingly fulfilling for me being an adult now reading about pre-teens. These stories are sweet and made me want to know more about these characters. I watched the movie years back, but this makes me want to watch it again for all the silly, girly feels (and I miss those ladies who starred in it &lt;3).The pants being a symbol in this story was a really honest yet fun take on passing the themes around in a book. I truly think it's a smart way to make the symbol so obvious yet... not? I feel like as a pre-teen I wouldn't have noticed the theme, but now as an adult it just warms me up!Ann makes you love and feel for these girls in this book. It wasn't the fastest moving story, but it still had me hooked at every word. I want to fall into these girls's worlds and be best friends with them (or mentor them, at this point in my life).I think this would be a great book for adults to read to their middle grade children, or introduce to their teens. It's sweet and heartfelt - and it doesn't bring you down. It lifts your spirits up, which is something we really need in this world.If there are any cons about this book, it's that it isn't made for adults - if you are looking for an adult themed book, this isn't it. It's all about teenagers and their problems, in the minds of teenagers. It's not an adult look at teens, in my opinion.Overall, I'm in love with this series! I hope I'm able to find the rest of this series so I can fall into their lives once again.Four out of five stars!
