I read both of these books, one after the other, under separate covers either at the end of junior high or at the beginning of high school, then went on to pick up other cheap paperbacks of Huxley's writings none of which I could relate to much until encountering Doors of Perception in college. Years later I found this combined, hardcover edition and gave away the old paperbacks.Brave New World is so much commented upon that I can think of little to add except to note that it, particularly the stuff about sex, eugenics and outlawry, was fascinating to me as an early adolescent already much interested in science fiction. The social prognostications of Brave New World Revisited were upsetting, but rather dull and already dated by the time I read them. There's no reason to read that material unless one wants to understand Huxley or the fifties better.
