William Faulker, Light in August:"Sitting beside the road, watching the wagon mount the hill toward her, Lena thinks, 'I have come from Alabama, a fur piece.'"Here Faulker presents Lena who has a passive role in Light in August as this phrase (sitting, watching, thinking) points out - she is not actually doing an action here other than a purely mental one. There is a lonely, languid feeling imparted by "watching the wagon mount the hill" that is shared with the wonderful title of the book. The southern drawl in "fur" and the reference to being far from Alabama, mark this book as one of the deep South, just as Faulkner himself. The phrase is slow and takes its time to build up, just as the structure of the book for which it is the opening phrase. There are a multitude of verbs in the phrase, but as I pointed out earlier, they are passive - in the book, there is actually quite a lot of action and violence, but it is described at a slow, deliberate pace throughout.Light in August back in AP English was my first exposure to Faulkner and it was a mind-blower. His grandiose phrasing, the palpable violence and life in the characters, and the dark Southern gothic atmosphere mesmerized me. Although it was years before I returned to Faulkner, eventually reading nearly everything he wrote including the 2-volume biography by Joseph Blotner, Light in August had always held for me a high and exalted place in 20th C American literature and remains one of my all-time favorite books. Cover to cover, it is exquisitely wrought out of the mud of Yoknapatawpha County, Mississippi painfully depicting the entwined destinies of Lena Grove, Byron Burch, and Joe Christmas (what an extraordinary name for a character!). Equally impossible to forget is Faulkner's depiction of the preacher Gail Hightower - only rarely (Flannery O'Connor comes to mind - has anyone so vividly given a face as compelling and iconic to southern fundamentalism as this.An absolute must read especially if you are wishing to discover Faulkner.
