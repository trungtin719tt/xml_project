One of a few 'Six stars books' of modern literature (there are maybe three or five of them?). The ultimate work of western dualism. Armheim vs. Ulrich, Ulrich vs. Walter, Arnheim vs. Tuzzi, Diotima vs. Bonadea, General Stumm vs. Leinsdorf, Fischel vs. Hans Sepp, Kakania vs. Prussia. Reality vs. pseudoreality. Individual spirituality vs. regulated and intelligible morality.This is the peak, or plateau, of European thought, just like Mahler is the romantic cream of the western Music. If you go through this, you will understand why Franzen is only a laughing matter and skittish entertainment.
