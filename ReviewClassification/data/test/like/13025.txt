There are some books that are called "classics," but you don't really understand why until you read it and feel that you've been changed. You know, for certain, that even though the themes have been played again and again, that the story is as everlasting as the bricks in an ancient abbey.I'll save the rest of my thoughts for the Sword &amp; Laser recap, but I'm glad that we've also readThe Sparrowas an interesting comparison on the themes in both. Fantastic book, even if you don't speak a lick of Latin!
