It has been forever since I dove into an outlander book and after diving into this one... I can gladly say that I actually enjoyed this one.A Breath of Snow and Ashesstill has your favorite couple, Jamie and Claire. Or maybe your least favorite? Who knows! Now I know I've had my fair share of ups and downs with these books and this couple but once they got to North Carolina - I was in. Now this is about the american revolution and how it is in full swing baby!Reading about how Jamie and Claire were apart of that was pretty interesting. They both have to make pretty tough and interesting decisions in this book. Especially with knowing about what's actually going to happen and how they can change the future. Then there's the whole loyalty thing that comes into play. Besides those two, there's Brianna and Roger who also deal with some crazy shit. I do love the romance and chemistry between Jamie and Claire more though - sorry, not sorry.Now I'm not going to name every character in this book because we meet a lot. There's too many to talk about or keep track of. In the end, I did enjoy this book. I wouldn't necessarily say it's my favorite out of the whole series because 1) that would be a lie and 2) that would be outlander - duh!
