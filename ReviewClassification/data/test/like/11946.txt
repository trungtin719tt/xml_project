Forgot to mention I binge read the first three books in this series a couple weekends ago. I don't really do chicklit, but this was amazing. BRIDGET JONES FEELS EVERYWHERE.LOVED THIS. Thank youIngefor an amazing recommendation. This was feel good chocolate and wine and shoes and just what I needed. HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
