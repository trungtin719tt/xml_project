So, I am very, VERY relieved that I enjoyed this. I was beginning to wonder if I just didn't like Fairy Tale Re-tellings, but this one pulled me out of the slump!I am so glad that Alex Flinn stuck with the "Beauty and the Beast" story... She made it modern, but didn't change the BIG details.Our Beast, Kyle is a high schooler, a very rich, very good looking (as he describes himself, so obviously he's totally modest right?!?!?) one. He values looks and money over everything. He can't even look at "Ugly" people. There are beneath him. One day he messes up, he invites a "goth/non-pretty" Girl to a dance, but he is tricking her. All he wants to do is just laugh in her face.... Not such a nice guy. But, he screws himself over because she wants her 'comeuppance'. She's a witch, she turns him into a Beast. He loathes himself, he thinks it is the worst possible thing that could have ever happened. But, what do you expect from the child of a TV News Dad who would rather risk his child's life than to have him looking like a monster, a Dad who ships his kid of to a house to live alone with the exception of a maid and tutor. He isolates his own child, so he doesn't effect his image. Pathetic. But, our Beast has a possible out of his condition-to find true love and have her kiss him true loves kiss. He thinks it is impossible. But, circumstances fall to his advantage when a drug dealer comes along and tries to rob him. Instead of just taking a beating like a man, the dead-beat Dad offers his Daughter in return. He GIVES AWAY HIS DAUGHTER!!!! Ack! We get to witness the Daughter, Lindy and our beast (who has now renamed himself Adrian) grow to become friends and possibly even love each other? Will she be the one to break the curse? Is it to late?At First, I was a little thrown off by the Chat's, but they grew on me. A little Cheesy at times, but it wasn't a huge part of the story.. it didn't make or break anything.I am uber excited to see the Movie!Here's the trailer[image error]Desktop Nexus:Wallpapers&gt;Entertainment Wallpapers&gt;Movies Wallpaperwhy does he look like that though?? In the book he really is a beast, you know the hairy kind....Something along these linesAnd,NPH is the blind teacher!!!ANDone of the Olsen twins is the Witch... she is creepy though!!!Ok, off my movie rant....seriously I think you should read this if youa: like fairy tale retellingsb: are into coming of age, realizing the importance of living type booksc. like beauty and the beastd. or if your just curious about itSidenote: I really don't like the cover on this one. I understand what is represents, but it didn't do its job to reel me in (being the cover judger that I am). I wish it was more modern looking, because the story being told is a Way modernized version of the classis, 'Beauty and the Beast". So I wish the cover matched that. I like it a little more now that I have read the book and understand the meaning behind it, but they could have been Way more creative with it!!!!!
