Wonderful! Just wonderful! If you haven't gotten around to reading Eugene Onegin yet, get the Naxos audio version. (It's available through either Naxos or Audible.) The translation by Mary Hobson is very pleasing, and Neville Jacobson's narration is superb. I have read Pushkin's novel in verse in several very good translations, and none is better than this. To finally be able to hear the lines is amazingly satisfying. What's it about, you ask? Oh, Russia, family, society, unrequited love, that sort of thing. You just have to read it to begin to know. And here's a plus--the recordings is only 4 1/2 hours long, so you can read it 10 times or more in the time it takes to read the average Russian classic. I know I will.And now I have a second recording: the Falen translation, with the book to follow along with. Poor Eugene! Will he ever grow up?
