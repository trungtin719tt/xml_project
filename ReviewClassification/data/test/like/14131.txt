Am I going to have to hear it all againhe thoughtI am going to have to hear it all over again I am already hearing it all over again I am listening to it all over again I shall never have to listen to anything else but this again forever so apparently not only a man never outlives his father but not even his friends and acquaintances do.Yes he could see it all again in his mind as if he were there in front of the grave plots the tombstone pillars rising out of the misty ground thoughts of if you build it the future will arrive this way of self fulfilling prophecy. Who bought and paid for them and who bled water from stone it was Judith he could see it all again in his mind and yes he was there reading the epithets. Here lies I don't hate the south here lies you had to have been born here here lies I was born here. He sounds just like his father everyone he meets sounds just like his father. I thought they all sounded like his father. I thought they all sounded just like William Faulkner. I thought they sounded like what you can give another person in a newly learned language that cannot lose its own accent. What does it look like if you could see it all in your mind and buy the land and the carvings in the stone. What you can give another person tastes like mind bending the spoons of rusted silver born in your mouth. What do you sound like when you learn to practice for speech class with tombstone marbles in your mouth and bent only in company good silverware? Do you stand up tall and intone your words of the meaning of love from within?I have met Quentin Compson. I know that he doesn't. If we meet in the next life I have bones to pick with him. I have known that he doesn't and I have performed contortionist feats to wish it could have been any other way. It could have been another way. I've seen him and been there as he doesn't give his sister Caddy what he could have given her. Father, it was incest and father I have fallen too so cast me out, make us together again on the outside. He could have been her brother, and he could have been her family, he could have seen what you should know about someone you love and who loves you.Quentin Compson speaks back over refrigerated years to his nineteen year old university roommate. They could be sitting at a kitchen table over insomniac coffee or voices in bedside dark as two kids whispering secrets before they've moved out of the family home. The kind of voices that prematurely sense we've grown up and started new lives and here we meet as before, temporarily, to discuss this shared past. They could see it all in the voice of Quentin's father and this young man from another time takes on the voices of handed down stories from his father's father. It wasn't our past and yet here we stretch out our hands past lights out and this is what happened storytelling voice. I loved how Faulkner describes the bulk of a boy who looks thirteen in his over grown body contrasted to another build that appears older than their years for standing in flesh time and moving incalculable years into the future of unlived time. Shreve speaks his nineteen years that belong to him. He tries to say the lonely old demon man who had no other friends than the original storytelling voice, Quentin's grandfather, because he chose lechery. He tries to say maybe it was love, maybe things are the way they are because that's how they used to be. I loved how Faulkner described this because I could see it too, could hear the storytelling voice. But Quentin says I don't know, I don't know what love is and you had to have been from the south. He says my years don't belong to me he says I am twenty and I was born old. I am from the south. In my childhood I'd reenact family stories that happened before I was ever born. A favorite was the tale of my then fifteen year old aunt running away from home after a home abortion from my grandmother. The reenactment was chosen for the screaming of "THAT'S MY DOUCHE BAG!" when my aunt tried to pack her mother's douche bag that did not belong to her. I was terrified of my grandmother and I knew exactly how she looked and sounded in this scene despite the fact of my nonexistence. I must have already known how it felt to be the one running away and the daughter, my mother, left behind. I believe in years that are not yours and I don't believe in speaking for others without listening to the part that is new. I think if it is too easy it isn't alive and Quentin walks the too easy when he owns the years as if they were clothes and not ghosts. I see when he chooses to not move out of the ideals in The Sound and the Fury. What he could see, what they reenact together is a choice. It is as interesting to me what you choose to see than what you are born knowing. You only don't remember how it got there.When I'm not reading Faulkner I want to read Faulkner. I want his character descriptions. They have a power and not stopping to think the words out loud I still thought "I know exactly what he's talking about" when Quentin sees those grave stones as if he is there. He has too much power, or maybe it is the part of the story that is how the story is told. I can think it was special to tell the story this way of revealing what could have happened every time the story is retold from what someone else adds to it. Bon was their brother. Maybe Bon never lived a word of promise to Judith and maybe he never lifted a finger to wrap siblings Judith and Henry around his. I already knew that he hadn't and when I already know it I am told it again like pretty words that are never spoken louder than words with action. I know that they never know Bon and their not knowing wasn't as important to me as knowing why they chose something they invented rather than something or someone they could know. Absalom made me writhe in what I already know and pretty finger crooking words. I know this was how the story was told and the story is what you are given by how someone else chooses to see you. Knowing the shape of the book is not the same as living inside of it and I was frustrated with this device of ghosts reappearing. Or the story is what is taken from you by how they choose to see you, if that's how you choose to see it. That something could be taken from you. I miss Faulkner when I'm not reading him, for not connecting all of the dots on my eyes that are made from staring too long at real or artificial light, and when I was reading him I wished that I could for once see Henry and Judith's relationship as it was, that he didn't paint vivid pictures that they were really happening now. I wanted the bright hot Faulkner descriptions of my memory rather than the reality of killer descriptions of life. I'm probably a pain in the ass reading a book and wishing it was real. That's probably an insane confession and not a legitimate complaint. I wanted to give them something of my own. I am told that they grew up together out of the funeral fires of their father, their mausoleum house and the cold womb of their mother that cocoons in the kind of life that is made up of I got married and then my daughter gets married. She dies. If you want to take their word for it....A voice chooses to put Aunt-Miss-Rosa in moving in and spicing the food to her flavor. What's the loneliest way you can choose to be another person? The judgmental aunt the spinster aunt the running back to her dead house shocked face. Shreve and Quentin speak of demonizing and I wanted to talk to Rosa about her unchildhood. What did it look like when she takes the photograph of the Bon that none of them knew for her dreams? I am haunted by the sight of her in my mind. How did she get the food to stealth to her father in the attic? For four years? As a little girl in war time? Miss Rosa stealing for the trousseau of strangers. Never loved, no real family. She's the Aunt-Miss-Rosa not related to anyone and she lies in her bed for forty-five years going Why? Why? Why? Voices choose to give pull to the leash she heeds to like a dog when the demon says "Come". I wished that she had ever had a life. I wish I could give her a life and I wonder how it is her face that is the creep behind time's formaldehyde. What did Henry and Judith own other than a mutual obsession? I loved it when I could peek behind the storytelling curtain and wonder for myself if they were not more disturbed that Bon had a photograph of the octoroon woman and their baby. A sign that their vision did not belong to them roused me more than anyone talking and talking about what happened when their mutual dreams fell (who fed them to who did not matter as much to me as I never got to see them making them, nor learn their brother-sister language). No, if Aunt-Miss-Rosa saw a demon in old Thomas Sutpen I wasn't moved by his Sutpen's hundred plantation in the sky. If the blood and guts felt real when the fists flew the unsettlement in my belly came from the slaves who could not choose to be there rather than where he chose to lie.When a voice says that the white women rested on where the white prostitutes and where the black women could not choose to lie it was not the white woman's flesh I saw, for how often white woman's flesh was glimpsed on their breath. No, if a white man goes to the fields and says send me this one and that one and they have to come lie down with him I wouldn't say that the position of I have two days to live my wedding and my daughter's wedding rested on that. What I wanted to give them was a life to live, for anyone to have a life to live, that was not that. When I see the photograph of the octoroon woman and her baby I don't live a mysterious life of moving through the world out of place. It shouldn't be mine to give them or to anyone else. But I want to see them and not go to the fastest course to I know you without having to know you. I want to see them to know them to know something important. That's what I felt when I read The Sound and the Fury. I didn't have to know Caddy, to tell her how to live her life or what she should do with the pull in her arms to wrap around someone else. I knew without even having to see her that she loved and had a heart and that was important. Iknowthis reading Faulkner and I wish that it was something that people could just know and give to each other so much that I can taste it. When I'm reading him I want so much that I can hardly sit still that they speak for themselves. I feel Quentin's discomfort and he's a disappointment to me. When Shreve talks about love I don't know that it is love either. Judith and Henry do not love Bon. I don't know what it is they love and it isn't his mystery that I know or love. I'm stuck on wondering what it is anyone wants or knows about anyone else in the first place. Shouldn't it be for something better than an angry dream that ends in blood? I'm haunted by the fifteen year old girl seduced by stale candy. What did she think her life was going to be? What was her dream? When Aunt-Miss-Rosa receives charity baskets of food left on her porch in the we can't be people together face to face night. When Clytie sleeps on the floor and calls white people "Marster" and never leaves and never lives without them, only so close to anyone to mark distance from someone else. Tears stillborn in Judith's eyes when confirming Bon's death. If they were never meant or if they needed permission someone else would tell you. They are haunted by not living. I don't know if I'd call that growing old.Because he was not articulated in this world. He was a walking shadow. He was the light-blinded bat-like image of his own torment cast by the fierce demoniac lantern up from beneath the earth's crust and hence in retrograde, reverse; from abysmal and chaotic dark to eternal and abysmal dark completing his descending (do you mark the gradation?) ellipsis, clinging, trying to cling with vain unsubstantial hands to what would hold him, save him, arrest him- Ellen (do you mark them?), myself, then last of all that fatherless daughter of Wash Jones' only child who, so I heard once, died in a Memphis brothel- to find severance (even if not rest and peace) at last in the stroke of a rusty scythe.
