So this wasBY FARmy favorite installment in the firstMistborntrilogy.I cannot even begin to sum up how great this was.LIKE DAMN.I've mentioned before how much I appreciate Sanderson's heavy inclusion of religion and religious characters in his work. He somehow is able to ask those big questions, taking his characters through hell and back, without making the reader feel at all criticized or alienated.The character developments in this one (especially for my precious Spook) were justbeyond anything I could've imagined.I am thrilled with howeach character grew to be so much more than what they werewhen we began this journey inThe Final Empire.Now that I'm sitting at the end of this series, I believe wholeheartedly thatthis bookis responsible for tying together the first two into what became thisbrilliant high fantasy epic.A beautifully crafted ending.Buddy read this with the wonderfully adorable &amp; amazingTweebie Bird!
