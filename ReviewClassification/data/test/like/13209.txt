I can see why people don't appreciate the Nile much equally to other famous Christie's novels: The Oriental Express or And Then There We're None, still I love the way the story unfold itself. The crime is also humanly touching, practical and realistic. There's also the elements such as atmosphere, the journey to the Nile, and old-fashioned who-dun-it crime scene in the transitional place (boat, and reminding of the old day's the train express) which can be variously interpreted, for such, the place of the complexities of the mind and the journey to the dark exposure of the soul and human's true feelings.
