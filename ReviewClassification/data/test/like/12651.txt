I hated to finish this book, because I loved it so much.It is the story of a Hasidic boy who loves to draw and paint and has the ability to become a great artist, but his father hates his obsession with art because he thinks it is from the Other Side and is evil.I loved how this story drew me into the daily life of this young boy, his family and his struggle to become who he was meant to be. I, too, had a gift for drawing and know how devastating it is to be not only not encouraged, but actively discouraged, from doing the one thing you love to do most.I also realized how much I didn't know about the Judaism and Hasidism in particular. I loved learning about the prayers, customs, history and vocabulary.This is a beautiful book. There was a sequel written in 1990 that I will be reading too.
