I'm stunned. I was expecting something along the lines of the House of Night series, but this was much different. I haven't read a book that had such a good twist in it in a long time. I thought I had a pretty good grip on what was happening in the story, but midway through the author pulled the rug out from underneath me! Excellent! Can't wait to read the next one.
