Update - 4 years on...Can it really be that long ago? It's a book I listened to over a period of weeks, over 40 hours worth of the normal Murakami mix of sex, food and parallel dimensions. But that's barely scratching the surface. It's a book that still haunts me, though in truth I can no longer recall much of the detail.I do remember that at heart the narrative is a simple one: boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy searches for girl - though this might just be the only simple thing about this book.I know I'll have to listen to it again - and I really do think that audio is the ideal vehicle for Murakami's longer, more complex pieces - probably within the next 12 months. I know it'll call me back.--------------------------------------An epic, magnificent and surreal love story. A quiet maths teacher realises he loves a girl he has barely spoken to who, unbeknown to him, has become a contract killer. The story unfolds through the eyes of these two and a third character. It moves slowly - well, it's got plenty of room at something like 1200 pages - and sometimes nothing of any consequence happens for quite some time. The whole thing is complex and surprising. It's beautifully told and I found myself able to accept and even welcome the more bizarre elements.In Murakami's best novels (and this one certainly qualifies) the sense of not knowing where he's going to take you and what it's going to feel like when you get there is exhilarating. I know this book divides opinion but I believe it to be quite brilliant!
