4.75 starsAs someone who had a close friend that fell into using drugs and sleeping around, this book really hit home. It made me feel like I was reliving seeing my friend fall apart, right before my very eyes. It hurt to read this at some parts, made me want to shake Kristina and beg her to "please, stop" to tell her she's "better than this." But of course, I knew that would do little good. It hadn't done much for my friend. In fact, it'd done nothing.I was surprised by how much I enjoyed the writing and structure of the novel. It's really unique and fitting for the story - because while you're on drugs nothing in life goes smoothy - just like the choppy chapters and pages in this novel. It was smart on Hopkins part to write it that way.It's also heartbreaking to hear that this happened to Hopkins own daughter. And that she began writing this soon after her daughter went to prison. That just made me realize how bad getting addicted to drugs is, and how my experience with watching my friend fall victim is onlyonecase out of thousands. Which is honestly, scary stuff.Overall, this was something I didn't intend to like as much as I did. I expected to read it and think: "Okay. It's unique." Butneverdid I think I would connect so much - as though I was living through my friends eyes, seeing why it was all so addicting. In a way, I'm glad to have seen what she went through. And for those wondering, yes, she's doing better now. After getting out of her bad family situation she moved out of the state with her sister. Now, they both attend University and live life happily and peacefully. Mainly stressing out about school and work. I'm proud of her new lifestyle, but I also know how easy it is to fall back to the "Monster." She tells me sometimes how that scares her more than anything else. That theneedinside of her for the Monster will win, one day. I can only pray that will never happen.Either way, this was outstanding. I'll need to get my hands on the next two books. Soon.
