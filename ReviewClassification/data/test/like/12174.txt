My book is calledWalk Two Moons. This book is a touching book about a girl who spends all summer with her grand parents with a wish to be united with her mother and she traveled the country to go see her loving mother. She talks a long hard journey through several states and hits a few bumps along the way but her grand mother and grand father support her through the journey.. her grandparents are a handful and she has to keep them straight in the big cities unlike the small town they grew up in. They have a fun and crazy adventure and i think you should take it with them!!
