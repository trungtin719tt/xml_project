Aussie author Kate Morton deftly managed to push nearly every one of my reading buttons with her lovely book,The Forgotten Garden:1. Not so young woman with a haunted past - check2. Not-so-fairy-Grandmother who bequeaths said woman an old house with a mysterious history - check3. Said old, mysterious house is actually a cottage on the wild Cornish coast, complete with a hidden garden, a handsome neighbor, and the faintest suggestion of the supernatural - check4. Said woman embarks on a quest to uncover her family secrets and heal thyself --- game, set, matchEach chapter of The Forgotten Garden is told through the voices of 3 women: Eliza, Nell and Cassandra, and covers several different time periods throughout the 20th and early 21st century. We get to know Eliza, Nell and Cassandra intimately, and through them other characters who play a large part in the unfolding story: Rose, Nathaniel, Adeline, and Linus. Not a book to put down for a few days and pick back up later, The Forgotten Garden needs to be savored in long stretches so that the reader can fully connect to each character and their backstory. The continually jumping characters and time periods can get confusing and distracting at times , which prevents me from rating this story with a solid 5 stars. Otherwise, this tale is tailor made for my reading tastes, with sentences, like the following, that speak to me:"She unlocked the front door and went inside. The house seemed to be listening, waiting to see what she would do. She ran her hand lightly along the inside wall. "My house," she said softly, "This is my house." The words pressed dully into the walls. How strange it was, how unexpected. She wandered through the kitchen, past the spinning wheel and into the little sitting room at the very front. The house felt different now that she was alone. Familiar somehow, like a place she'd visited long ago."Simple and comforting. My kind of book.
