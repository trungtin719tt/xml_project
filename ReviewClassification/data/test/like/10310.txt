The Red Pyramid (Kane Chronicles #1) by Rick Riordan is a graphic novel for kids. The illustrations are great, the fonts are easy to read. The story is wonderful and easy to follow. The characters are unique and fun, at least the good ones! All characters were well developed and memorable. I thought this would be a small comic book sized novel but it was a large, full length novel. A novel and a movie in one! Lots of surprises and action. A great book for kids and us oldies that pretend to be kids! I got this book from the library.
