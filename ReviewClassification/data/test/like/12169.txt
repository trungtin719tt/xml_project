A truly excellent book. Unfortunately we were reading it aloud to youngest son and weren't prepared for the somewhat surprize ending which was very hard on him. Probably not for the youngest readers. Otherwise the story is well written, well paced, we were instantly drawn in to it, extremely likeable characters (except maybe the English teacher). It ends well, just was hard as I said.
