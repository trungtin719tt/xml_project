I've only re-read a handful of books in my life, and I've read this one at least 5 times. If I had to pick a favorite book of all time (sacrilege!) - it would be this one. Never have I seen prose that has this much POETRY in it. How Green is a unique, lyrical beauty.The coming-of-age narrator, Huw, so well paints a picture of his everyday struggles in a rapidly-industrialized Wales that you can literally hear the birds and smell the blackberry pie. Of course many authors are good at descriptions such as those - but where I believe Llewellyn truly distinguishes himself is in his descriptions of emotional states and experiences. He'll describe a self-righteous man looking up with eyes "hurting in goodness" or innumerate the beatings of his heart and lyrics tumbling away to Forgot as he stands in church to sing a solo... and I just want to scream inside because I've felt EXACTLY that way before and never been able to process it into such perfect words. The moral messages are amazing. The characters are unforgettable. Somehow I understand life better when I read this book.MY FAVORITE SECTION OF ANY BOOK EVER WRITTEN:"I am Beth Morgan," my mother said, and her voice was as deep and strong as any man. "I have come up here to tell you what I do think of you all, because I have heard you are talking against my husband. Two things in this world I do hate. One is talking behind the back, and the other is lice. So you should know what I do think of you... You are a lot of cowards to talk against my husband... How some of you can sit in the same Chapel with him I cannot tell. I would look for a flame of fire upon me, indeed. But there is one thing more I will say and that is this. If harm do come to my Gwilym, I will find out the men and I will kill them with my hands. And that I will swear by God Almighty. And there will be no Hell for me. Nobody will go to Hell for killing lice."FAVORITE QUOTES:I never met anybody whose talk was better than good food.It is strange how loud little sounds become when you are in the dark and doing something wrong."Trouble will not stop in a man whose lungs are filled with fresh air." (Papa Gwilym)After that, it was like trying to talk through a net. Words seemed to stick in the air. Nobody seemed willing to look at anybody else. And when somebody laughed, you could tell how hard they were trying."Man was made in the image of God. Is God a sheep? Because if He is, I understand why we are all so damned stupid." (Ianto)I saw her face as she bent to blow out the candle with her mouth in the shape of a kiss, still the smile in the eyes, but now as a mother will look at her child that cries in the arms of another woman, softer, and with more of want.He cleared his throat as though pain had been his only meal for hours."You cannot blame ignorant men. You might as well kick a dog for not wishing good morning." (Mr. Gruffydd)"I thought when I was a young man that I would conquer the world with truth. I thought I would lead an army greater than Alexander ever dreamed of, not to conquer nations, but to liberate mankind. With truth. With the golden sound of the Word. But only a few heard the trumpet. Only a few understood. The rest of them put on black and sat in Chapel." (Mr. Gruffydd)"It is only when men forget to fight for right that they fail. There are plenty to fight for wrong." (Ianto)They could not have had more happiness in their eyes, and my heart could not have known more lightness, or I would have been off the earth and drinking the skies.
