Ever sice I first picked it up in library last year in summer, Warriors has (and always will be) one of the best book series I have ever read. There are loads of books in this series, and there are just a couple of newly-released ones I haven't got. For my birthday, I got some more and I decided to start the series agin, just to catch up. This book seemed even better than I read it for the first time in June 2009.The first series is set in a forest, divided in to four territories, each belonging to one clan - ThunderClan, RiverClan, WindClan and ShadowClan. The main focus of the story is on ThunderClan, where there are not many warriors (cats that are tranied to defend the clan). The leader, Bluestar, accepts a 'kittypet' (house cat) into the clan named Rusty. Many of the clan cats protest against this, but Rusty still becomes an apprentice (a young cat training to be a warrior). Rusty's name therefore becomes Firepaw. He makes a best friend called Graypaw, who is also an apprentice. Before Firepaw joins ThunderClan, a ThunderClan cat called Tigerclaw murders his clans' deputy Redtail, in secret, to try and become deputy himself. But his hopes were shattered as Bluestar annouced that Lionheart would became deptuty instead. When Lionheart dies Tigerclaw gets his own way and becomes deputy. Firepaw finds out that Ravenpaw, Tigerclaw's spprentice, knew about the secret behind Redtail's death and also discovers that Tigerclaw is out to get Ravenpaw. Firepaw and Grawpaw help Ravenpaw escape to a farm beyond clan territory, where a kind cat called Barley lives. At the end of the book, Firepaw gets his warrior name: Fireheart.Trust me, I'm not that good at convincing people to do stuff, but believe me when I say that you have to read this book!Yay I wrote a long review!!
