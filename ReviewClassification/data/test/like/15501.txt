Definitely in my top 10 favorite poems. I love the way it flows; the lyrical rhythm "soothes the battered soul".Day after day, day after day,We stuck, nor breath nor motion;As idle as a painted shipUpon a painted ocean.Water, water, everywhereAnd all the boards did shrink;Water, water, everywhere,Nor any drop to drink.
