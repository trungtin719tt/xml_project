The ending of this one is very painful as those sadistic fairies torture Sookie and kill a few of her friends. I sure enjoyed it five stars right up until near the end but when I read about Claudine dying and some others after being tortured its just too much for me. I guess fairies are the most vicious and evil creatures of all! I hope the door to Fairy is sealed permanently.
