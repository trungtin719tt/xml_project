This is a very rare book which has convinced thousands of its readers here at goodreads to give it the highest rating possible solely on the strength of the story in it. Those who look for unique writing styles, or breathtaking passages, memorable quotes, wordplays, or interesting new words will not find anything here. The author, who was born and who grew up in China, learned the rudiments of the English language when she was already a young adult. So she wrote this in an English which is just enough to communicate. No fanciful prose here.For that, and only for that, one might say that this is not perfect and should therefore receive a less than perfect rating. After all, how can something like this be considered on par with those which are considered masterpieces both in content and style? And yet!Compare, for instance, the starting phrase of this great classic "A Tale of Two Cities" by Charles Dickens--"It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair..."with that of this family memoir by Jung Chang which simply goes--"At the age of fifteen my grandmother became the concubine of a warlord general..."and the vast difference can easily be felt: Dickens hints of trouble ahead, perhaps some deliberate, confusing ambiguities in the plot which would make his reader perplex and unsure whether it was the best or worst of times, yatata yatata; whereas Jung Chang hits the ground running, already telling a story in a fairy tale-like manner. The formerwarns you to proceed carefully and at your own risk, the latter invites you to sit on your mother's lap, a young child once more, so you may listen to a wonderful story about a once upon a time, about a warlord general and a very young girl who had bound feet, who became the warlord general's concubine, who had a daughter by him who, in turn, became an ardent communist later and was the mother of the author who had written this stupendous bestseller read by millions who finished reading it crying or at least misty-eyed.This is also a living and breathing history. Chinese history seen from the ground where ordinary Chinese lived, from the pre-civil war years, the Japanese occupation, the birth of communist China, the years of the harebrained ideas of Mao Tse-tung where millions suffered and died, up to the early post-Mao era. Anyone who finishes reading this with even the barest minimum of attention can easily pretend to be an expert sinologist and could better appreciate that other 1001 memoir, Zhang Xianling's "Half of Man is Woman" and avoid the mistake of calling the Chinese camps then as "gulags."
