Imagine my joy when walking into Waterstones in London and finding the prequel ofTrainspotting, one of my all-time favourite books. Having lovedTrainspottingso much I was kind of nervous of whatSkagboyswould do to the characters which I've grown to love so much, but I was pleasantly surprised. Like some people have said in their reviews, it was like meeting old friends after a long time again.Harsh and realistic spiced up with some good ol' dark humour. I completely fell in love with Fiona andooohhAlison!AfterSkagboys, I really want to readTrainspottingall over again.
