My favorite Heinlein novel - a great revolution story, a great AI story, and a great Hard Sci-Fi, if the science in question is political.What I learned from this book:1. History bends and melts over time.2. The first AI we meet might not be intentional.3. Throwing rocks can get serious over interplanetary distances.4. There ain't no such thing as a free lunch.
