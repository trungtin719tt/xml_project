The Warriors series has been really special to my youngest son over the years, but I haven't read them myself yet. This is a year for catching up on some things I've been meaning to read for a while, so I'm glad to finally dive into these books.After reading the first novel,Into the Wild, I can see why my son loves it so much. The writing perfectly describes the mannerisms of cats. It's easy to picture every movement and sound the cats make. The writing style is quick and full of momentum and energy. The story is a typical fantasy quest, and I found it to be a lot of fun.I like that the ending ties up a few loose ends but leaves the right amount of ongoing tension for the next books. Looking forward to continuing on through the series!
