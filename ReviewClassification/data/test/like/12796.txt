When going into this book, I was expecting a horror/creepy/spooky story, and that isn't what I got.. exactly. What I mean is that the overall tone of the book is creepy, and the drawings definitely are spooky, but the story itself is a contemporary tale about a boy trying to understand the feelings he has in regards to his mothers illness.I loved this book. I loved it. It is absolutely now one of my "all-time favourites". Here's why:1) The illustrations: The artwork in this book is BEAUTIFUL. It isn't all hand drawn, which I actually really liked because each piece of art felt like a textured creation with use of graphics and different artistic techniques. The drawings are super powerful and dark and alongside the text, they give the book a terrible and terrific sense of foreboding and unease.2) The poetry of the writing: I'll tell you right now, I don't like poetry. I don't dig it. But that doesn't mean that I don't appreciate beautiful and poetic writing, and this book definitely had that. The writing was gorgeous and rich and it made me feel like I was reading a delicious pastry. (I used a metaphor just now, and I stand by it.)3) The monster: The monster in this book has officially become one of my favourite characters of ever. He is so intelligent and kind and powerful and beautiful and loving and mean and ilovehim.4) Conor: I just wanted to hug him. I just wanted to let him know that I loved him. My favourite kind of main characters are the ones that I want to hold hands with, and Conor falls into that category.5) The subject matter: This was a SAD book, people, a very sad book. I don't like reading things that are tragic just for the sake being tragic, but this had a larger purpose, I felt.I loved this book. I recommend it to everyone. You should read it. I know I'll be reading it again soon.Written October 27th: I'll write a more comprehensive review tomorrow when I can get my act together because this book has left me shattered in pieces.
