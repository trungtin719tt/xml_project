I think this waas the third or fourth time I read this book and I am happy to say, I love it even more!In the meantime I have read Inferno by Dante as well, which made some of the things in this book clearer or put it imto more context than before.Also I loved taking my time with the book, as I knew where it would lead and didn't feel the rush of wanting to find out the ending but cherished spending time with the characters and the prose.The story touched me just as it does every time and I had to take frequent breaks to let the events sink in and reflect on them.I know I always say this, but READ THIS BOOK!Ten years after my first read and I still love the book.
