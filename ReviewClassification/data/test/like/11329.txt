I had been so excited for this book to come out, but I find I'm slightly let down with the lack of action. It's not that I'm looking for mega fights and battles. I just feel like much didn't really happen; it was more of a transition book. Just when it was getting to something more interesting that would move the plot along the book was coming to an end. And I absolutely hate where it left off - more than any of the other books. I guess I understand that this book was about her being "tempted" and all and that's why it centered on the things it did so much, but I feel like so much more could have been added. I have to remind myself that the book actually only covers a few days time and that only so much can happen in such a short time frame. I hate what happens at the end, but I understand that sometimes things simply have to happen.Despite whatever I just wrote, I did like the book. Heath was around alot and he is my favorite character hands down. It was nice to see him. It was exactly how I imagined his character to befrom the glimpses we'd seen of him before. He's such a doll! There was a lot going on and some things that made me bounce with excitement, want to scream at certain characters and even cry. I don't know if it's just because I've been extremely tired lately or what, but at one point someone made a comment during a situation that made me laugh so hard I had to stop reading and walk away from the book.I'm not sure how I feel about the different points of view. Sometimes I liked it, but other times I felt like it was just made things repetetive. It was nice to see the stuff going on with Stevie Rae that she was keeping from Zoey and other things that happened with various characters, but sometimes I felt like it was off point. I guess I just have to remind myself that the series isn't over and that the things that seem pointless and don't make sense to me now probably will be explained later on in the series.
