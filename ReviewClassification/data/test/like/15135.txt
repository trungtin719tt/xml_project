Oh, just to have that second chance...__________________________________________________________________________This is the first book I read every year. I read it in memory of a friend I lost going on seven years ago. January 1, 2015 I have read it again"O young girl, throw yourself again into the water so that I might have a second time the chance to save the two of us!" A second time, eh, what imprudence! Suppose, dear sir, someone actually took our word for it? It would have to be fulfilled. Brr...! the water is so cold! But let's reassure ourselves. It's too late now, it will always be too late. Fortunately!"To have a second chance and not be too late.
