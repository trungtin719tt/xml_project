Amazing. A classic for a reason.RE-READ: 2015. I read this book every Christmas Eve. It makes me laugh, it scares me, it makes me cry. So good! And so short! :) I must admit my favorite part is the first part where Scrooge is so grumpy and miserly. And the book is so classic, filled with classic lines that are so well-known it's a pleasure to read them because they are so familiar and true.And, once again, it's short. No trouble to get through! Merry Christmas!http://www.gocomics.com/bliss/2015/12/252017 Carmen checking in! Re-read this Christmas Eve. I'm always, always blown away by how good this book is. Very evocative, very well-written, funny, sad, touching... Dickens makes you laugh and cry as you are reading this. Powerful language. Short and easy to get through if you are scared to read Dickens for some reason. Highly recommended.
