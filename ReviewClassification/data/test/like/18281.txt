ThoughA Wrinkle in Timeis my favorite of these, all the books in the series were very well done, and kept me interested throuought.Apparently I have a love for books written for the younger set - teenagers. Seems that many of the authors just seem to work harder in that genre to produce a good book that also has literary merit. Must be all those "newberry-like" medals they're all striving for, but whatever it is, these fit.If you've never read them, you've missed out.
