I chose to read this book whilst taking a break from a very heavy read. What a great choice.It seems I'm behind the eight ball again, having only just read my first novel by this outstandingly talented author.What an inspiring, emotional and ultimately rewarding read, on a topic that is real and wretched and terribly sad.Alice is a brilliant and gifted Harvard Processor that hits her 50's with early onset Alzheimer's. I was taken in by this lovely lady, a beautiful character that Genova created and told her story with eloquence and grace.She has created a piece of work that speaks of such a hard topic, with factual information in a way that could be described as hauntingly real. This author has shown respect for this topic by researching thoroughly, she's a very clever woman.If a reader was to have personal experience with this topic, I would understand their having doubts with this one, but I think it actually may be a wise choice?I loved Alice, I adore a book where I can say that about the central character. I could still see her, thanks to the skilful writing of this fabulous author. I'm a happy reader right now, please read this one, it's so good!
