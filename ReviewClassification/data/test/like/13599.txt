Finally, Douglas Adams pulls me out of my reading funk.This is not just a book of jokes, it is, but they're *smart* jokes. The book is really full of philosophy, how does language shape a cultures destiny, solipsism, interconnectivity, and the individuals relationship to not just themselves and those around them, but the world. This, however, is all lingering behind the odd and absurdity that is Douglas Adams usual style of writing.He gets people, man. He gets people.
