I'm not even sure what to say about this book without giving anything away. US Marshal Teddy Daniels shows up at rocky island that's an asylum for the criminally insane to track a patient that disappeared from a locked cell. While on the island, he gets the sense that the doctors are hiding something and sets out to obtain evidence that they are experimenting illegally on patients. As Daniels uncovers secrets, you become more confused about what is actually happening at the hospital.I'm vague to avoid spoilers, but none of this will make sense unless you've read the book (or seen the movie):My favorite part of the book was the what added the psychological thriller: an insane person will claim he or she is not insane. Ergo, if you claim you are sane, you are insane. All the witnesses were unreliable, but we have to trust what the protagonist sees and believes until he figures out the next clue. Throw in conspiracy theories, and you never know what to trust. I loved the story shift and the foreshadowing and that even though he couldn't figure out why, Daniels could tell he couldn't trust these people. There were some brilliant moments, like the scene with Noyce that could be misconstrued one way or the other, depending on which story option you believe.My least favorite parts:-The gratuitous language and sexual content, especially the scene with his wife. Was that necessary? It didn't add anything to the story and it actually made me reluctant to pick it up for a few days.-I sometimes had a hard time with the plot concept that a whole staff would encourage paranoia in a violent patient. How is crazy making a curing technique? Take the conversation with Trey about the fence, which is the only moment in the book where no one is playing games, but why? It's the one scene that keeps me from believing the second option.I still think the concept of the book was brilliant. Even though I was bound and determined to figure out that twist, I didn't. Lehane leaves the ending somewhat open, but it's clear which option we're supposed to believe. I don't know though, some drugs, the power of suggestion, a plausible story, I'm not discounting either one. That's kind of the point of the story, the uncertainty of reality for the insane. Creepy or sad, what do you choose to believe?
