I love this book. This is an amazing and heart-wrenching and appropriate end to this epic series. This book is the culmination of a huge investment, both for author and reader, and it's a draining one. So much is found, and lost, and gained and lost and it makes me heartsore.As much as I love this book, I always hit a point on re-reads where I just stall. Not because the book is bad (it's most absolutely definitely assuredly not), but because after taking this journey with these characters I love so much, after being with them for so long, I dread the end... I dread having to put this story back on the shelf when it's over.This is the kind of book that I love beyond almost all others - books that open up their pages and let me fall right in... books that take me with them wherever it is they go, and accept me as part of the gang. This series is the epitome of escapist reading for me. I dream about this series and live in it while I read, and love it for a multitude of reasons that I couldn't even begin to enumerate here.It's amazing... So just read it already. That's all I'm saying.
