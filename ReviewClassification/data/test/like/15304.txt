I have to say, that the only bad thing that i found in this books was the undeveloped relationship between Stefan and Elena. Otherwise i loved the book and it definitely deserves 5 stars. i am getting the second soon and i am freaking! i finished this book within hours of starting it, the plot twists and the endearing characters kept me reading. it had just enough conflict in the romance that it actually made me doubt a happily ever after. Although i still am not sure where the series will go. I hate to say it, but it makes me doubt Stephenie Meyer. this books was written long before her "Twilight" (which i consider the most amazing book ever written.) and the plot has an unmistakable resemblance, i have a strong feeling this is one of the books that inspired her book. But they both have unique ways of pulling you in and bringing you into the horror and romance of the character and it is amazing how much i can love a book and compare it to Twilight. I definitely recommend this book to anyone who enjoyed anything from Twilight to Cirque Du Freak.
