I have been known to bet a couple of bucks on a horse race or two. I lived in Kentucky for about 10 years where horse racing is king. Now I live within a couple of hours of close to a dozen horse tracks - including Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby. Because of all this, I figured I might be interested in the biography of one of history's most famous horses.I was definitely satisfied with the experience!The story of Seabiscuit reads like it was written for Hollywood and plays out like almost every emotional sports story ever. Humble beginnings, Scrappy, unlikely heroes, successes, adversity, failure, no hope, recovery, and final ultimate triumph - all these elements are here! You will be amazed, you will be moved, you will be yelling at each horse race retelling, cheering of Seabiscuit to succeed. In the end, I can 99% guarantee you will be exhausted and satisfied.While it did not bother me, there is an awful lot about horse racing and horse training. If these things do not interest you, you may find some parts slow. Luckily for me, I was enthralled with horse training and the finer points of horse racing much more that I ever thought I would be.If you enjoy a good sports story, if you like stories about the underdog becoming the champion, or if you enjoy books with a good history lesson, it is definitely worth giving Seabiscuit a try!
