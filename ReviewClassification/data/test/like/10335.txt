4.5/5 STARS!!I finally finished my first book for 2016!!! This book took me a little over 3 weeks to finish and I LOVED IT! I knew picking this book up, it was definitely going to take me awhile to finish it and I was ok with that. It has been over a year since I had read book 3 in this series, but I as soon as I started up with Drums of Autumn I felt like it was only few weeks since I had been in the world of Jamie and Claire. Honestly I could have done without the first 300 pages ... it just didn't seem to really add a whole lot to the main story and was just a lot of daily actives with just little bits of interesting things thrown in here and there. Other than just some slowness in the beginning I still absolutely love Diana Gabaldon's writing style and story telling. I was kinda surprised that this book didn't end with any kind of a cliffhanger like all the other ones have, so it makes me wonder where the next book is heading?
