This is an incredibly enjoyable fictional read for those interested in WWII history and how it affected families in Europe and in the U.S.Perhaps the most unfavourable aspect of Wouk's tale, however, is how he places at least one member of the protagonist Henry family in the very center of practically every major milestone event of the war: the attack on Poland, the historic meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill at Placentia Bay, Pearl Harbor, and so on. In every case a family member is right there to give us the narrative first hand. Granted, that is one great way to narrate history and make it come alive, which the author does well, but I find it a wee bit contrived.On the whole, though, it is a fascinating and well-researched book, bringing the disparate events of the most sweeping, wide-flung conflict of the 20th Century together for readers in a very readable yet detailed way.Interestingly, Henry Wouk passed away when I was half-way through his novel. He was 94 years of age!
