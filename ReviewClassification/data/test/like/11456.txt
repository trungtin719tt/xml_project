Well I just cried because of this book and that is not an easy thing to do. I think a total of about three books have ever made me cry before. It was just perfect. It was all a person could ask for in a final book. It was all thatAllegiantandMockingjayweren't. Congratulations Marie Lu on your success and for creating a trilogy with three flawless books. It's a really hard thing to do, I have read enough series that loose their amazing before they get the chance to conclude. It most certainly has a golden place in my heart!My only complaint is that I kind of wanted June to be the "champion" but I'm okay with it. I just like June a little bit better than Day. I consistently liked her, unlike Day. Though I have this suspicion that Marie Lu made me not like him as much in Prodigy on purpose. But I really grew tolovehim inChampion.And I must say that Antarctica creeped me the heck out. It was so cool to read about, but if there was ever actually a place like that... I just wouldn't be able to handle that.Another great thing about this series is that Marie Lu knew exactly what she as doing. Even if she didn't have itallplanned out, she did what she had to do. She didn't cause so much drama that there was no way to resolve it in a final book*coughs*Allegiant*coughs*The rest of the world was it's own problem. It was refreshing to read a dystopian novel where there is actually life and politics outside of America. I think the only other book I've personally read like that isCinderby Marissa Meyer. I think not having to explain the lack of countries and people helped Marie Lu to focus on the story she was telling.Most dystopians avoid keeping other countries around for convenience, but it was really one of the things that kept these books interesting. I think that a lot of authors who write dystopian get so lost because they create a world that they find they can't explain making their story hard to believe.Everything about this book was wonderful. It's really hard for me to let go of this series because each book came to me at a very interesting time in my life. I read the whole series in less than a year, yet I had to wait for each book release and when I read each individual book I felt like a slightly different person. I look forward to Marie Lu's next seriesThe Young ElitesIf anyone can pull off such a story she can!P.S. The maps in bothProdigyandChampionare gorgeous!Pre-ReleaseI finished Prodigy this morning (stayed up super late... yeah) and by the last 150 pages I was on an absolute emotional wreck. The book is not really that emotional but The night before I stayed up to read Hush, Hush by Becca Fitzpatrick so I had only gotten 5 and a half hours of sleep AND it was already super late. Its funny though, when we get that news about Day at the end I found it exciting. I think it could be really interesting to the story. As long as he lives. He better live.So this book is actually a 4.5 stars. Even though it is amazing and very interesting I have a few problems with it, unlike Legend, a solid 5 star. First of all, Tess. Why. Just no. And wasn't Tess excited to see June in Legend when she went to pay Keade to help Day escape, even after she did all of those things to him. I really hope we don't have a crazy not-exactly-a-love-triangle-but-close on our hands. Think about it. There is Day, Tess, Anden, and June. But Tess left and June (hopefully) still likes Day and it's just all so messed up.My last complaint was that Day was so mean to June. After their fight she was apologizing and being all nice and he was all "Whatever." She gave up everything for him and he was being a jerk. Still like them together, though.I cannot wait for the next book and I am super excited to see the font color of it. Am I the only one who's eyes went all crazy going from the blue font to the black? It would give the black a reddish tint. Anyways, Prodigy is so amazing and so pretty. I loved the map and the quality of the pages. The cover of prodigy made the first book look like crap when you put them next to each other but they still look like a series. Awesome.So yeah Can't wait. Day, if you die, I am going to kill you!
