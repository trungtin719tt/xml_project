I read all but a couple of Clancy's Ryan/Clark books and find them good in the extreme. I do prefer Vince Flynn and Brad Thor, but they're somewhat different (well their characters are closer to Clark than Ryan). In this one Ryan still hasn't actually started his political career... But he does get drawn into the danger, again.Jack (an annalist for the CIA)manages to get tagged to fly photos to the UK...from there he ends trying to convince the powers in charge that a Russian sub captain is trying to defect, not get close enough to the US (with the revolutionary new quiet drive Soviet sub) to launch an attack on the country. High level attitude? Sink the sub... Jack needs to convince everyone otherwise.Thumbnail synopsis but...if you've managed to get by till now without seeing the movie and you're thinking of reading the book I don't want to ruin it for you.Enjoy.
