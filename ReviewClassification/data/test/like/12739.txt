I always had an interest in Helen Keller. When I was young my parents nicknamed me Helen Keller, because I would go around to everyone's plates and demand food. I wouldn't eat off my plate, but I would gobble off others without remorse. I would still have this habit of munching off people's delectable morsels if I wasn't humiliated in High School. It was just second nature to me that I didn't even notice that I would grab a chip here and there. Helen Keller was introduced to me when I was very young, and I introduced her to my daughter. I somehow got my daughter into Brad Meltzer's children books,Ordinary People Change the World. They are biographical picture books. The first one I brought home was about Martin Luther King Jr, and she loved it. The second was Helen Keller, which my husband and I read almost everyday. They are really cute and in comic book form. Since reading about Helen Keller to my daughter I wanted to read her biography,The Story of My Life.Helen Keller was not born deaf and blind, but became very sick at nineteen months. The sickness ran it course, but left a permanent mark. Did she let her disability defeat her? If you watched the movie, or watched the many versions making fun of her disability you know the answer. But no she did not. Instead she learned to speak and in multiple languages, went to college, and helped many people out. She was a well to do woman, a go-getter, and an inspiration for generations. I think if she had a disability or not she would have done something amazing with her life. She was that kind of person when said she was going to do something she did it. Life was tough for her, but she zig-zagged to get what she wanted. She is a wonderful woman.It is weird to find that Helen and I have some similarities, besides eating off other people's plates. Maybe, I was Helen Keller in my past life! Just kidding, she would be disappointment in me. She described a story about being at the beach. She was playing in the ocean when unfortunately she was sucked under a wave. She eventually resurfaced. I too had this happen to me or I thought it did. It is a really fuzzy dream, but very real in my mind. I remember being at the beach on a dark and stormy day. I don't remember who I was with though. I feel like my parents wouldn't take me to the beach at that time, but somehow I was there. There I was in the water, when all of a sudden I too was sucked under a wave. I remember being jostled around, and doing many flips in the water. I held my breath and closed my eyes. I was afraid. Then somehow I was back on the sand. Once I opened my eyes I noticed that I wasn't far from my group, but still I was pushed down the beach. I remember running back, and that is the end of my memory. I had some very lucky moments if it wasn't a dream.Also, her thoughts about college are very similar to mine. She said "One goes to college to learn, it seems not to think." Sometimes that is how I felt. Here you having a full course load, which is 15 credit hours, and you are expected to memorize all this information about individuals, concepts, theories,..etc, but not really to use them. During college I felt like everything was rush, rush, rush. I just learned the concept and how to solve the problem. I had other course work to do and I couldn't sit too long on a subject. I have a science major for goodness sakes! Take Organic Chemistry and feel the misery of all science majors. After college I have a lot of time on my hand to think of the knowledge that I have gained, and analyze other concepts. Then you are suppose to study 3 hours for every credit hour. All the information you read for one class can conflicted with the other classes' information, which leaves you only with a jumbled bag of information that isn't categorized. College is hard, and not thinking about the subject in depth causes more pain.Helen Keller leaves me inspired. Her thoughts are beautiful. For someone without sight, she had vision. As an abled body we take advantage of our surroundings. Sadly, most of us are on our phones all day. Today, I left my phone in the car to get some coffee from Starbucks after a dreaded day of grocery shopping. It felt so good to be detached. I honestly hate being on my phone, but it is also second nature to me now that I don't realize it. I saw everyone looking down at their phone, not looking at the barista, not seeing their world around them. Made me feel sad, especially after finishing the biography part of the book. She imagined a beautiful world. She could see the trees and the grass. She noticed the world around her. I feel like I should go in my front yard (not the backyard. I have dogs) and just stare at the world. Memorize the bark off the tree. Look at the lines of the petals and leaves like I use too. Just to be grateful of the world. Lastly, after reading this she makes you want to go do something with your life. She did all these amazing things, and I think what is really stopping me from doing something I want to do. There will always be challenges, but you can find a way around it if you really want it. Don't let anything stop you from doing something you want to do. I know it is hard, and you might face enormous challenges, but YOU CAN MAKE IT HAPPEN. That is what I learned from Helen Keller.I hope everyone had a wonderful New Year. I have tons of plans for 2017. Let's do this. *plays awesome music* Also, check out my blog herehttp://dancingbetweenthecovers.com/re...
