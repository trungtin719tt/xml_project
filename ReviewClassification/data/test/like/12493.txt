It's all Emma Thompson's fault really. Picture it: A newly created city in the Canadian province of New Brunswick in 1996 and I was only 14 years old. It was my turn to pick the movie and growing weary of the male counterparts of the family always renting " Star Wars" or " Platoon", I settled on Sense &amp; Sensibility with Emma, her husband Greg Wise, Alan Rickman, and Kate Winslet( who was about to become the IT girl on this side of the pond). Mom declared it a good film, Dad fell asleep, and my brother ended up begging to go play hockey with his friends. I on the other hand was about to embark on a great journey- the life time road of a Jane Austen Addict. Not a month later, my mother bought me the completed novels of Jane Austen and S&amp; S became my first and ultimate favorite Jane Austen story.The Dashwood sisters- Elinor and Marianne, their younger sister, Margaret and their mother are forced to leave their family home after the death of their beloved father and husband. Now as a teenager, one would expect that I would identify with Marianne. She was a romantic and she basically straddles death over her girlish attachment to the dashing John Willoughby. Nope my 14 year old self was all about Colonel Brandon and 37 year old me still agrees. He's by far my favorite Austen male( even over Mr. Darcy). Elinor, has taken years for me to understand, but I find that I have come to admire and identify with how she kept her feelings suppressed but through Austen's writing we see glimmers of how hurt she really is by the separation from Edward Ferrars.All around a great book. Thanks, Emma!
