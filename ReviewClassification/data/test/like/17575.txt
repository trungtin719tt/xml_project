The first book made sense and I met my new love: Marvin the Paranoid Android. The second book "The restaurant at the end of the universe", made sense, sorta, kinda, but I can't explain why it made sense. Marvin was depressingly charming and I even had a small bout of depression in his honor. In this third installment, there is less of Marvin and more saving-the-universe type action. I constantly feel like Arthur Dent with all these things and new concepts being thrown at me from the lips of the author (he read the audiobook version) and I don't even know what to think, all I do is react to the story...maybe I should try flying and think about these stories at the crucial moment (this part will make sense if you read the book).To sum it up, I liked the book and now I want a Marvin plush doll.
