Intense, dramatic, heart breaking well written and 100% "morally complicated YA" Above all this is a book about LOVE. And love is always a good reason to read a book.I'm all for books that are different and play with dark themes. However this is not an easy read. It's heartbreaking at times and the themes can throw off plenty of readers. But if you like me, have preference for books in which love is challenged, where the characters have to fight for their love, you have to read this.This book is a perfect example that the YA genre is more than what people give it credit for. I found this book to be more awe-inspiring than many books in which the main character is an adult.Read it if you want something different and full of love.
