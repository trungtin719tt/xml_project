Not a bad debut. Inaccurate and slanderous portrayal of Spain aside, this was pretty good, a fun ride, a little immature but really enjoyable. Considering Brown set out to best Sidney Sheldon, one of SS's books impelled him to start writing his own, to pen a "better" thriller. I'd say he achieved his aim not sure if that's a victory. DB is horrendous with background. Say what you will about Sheldon but he got his research right, well most of it anyway.Read this during good times when the world was a little less gray, it was never innocent not even in 2005, so nothing but affection for Digital Fortress. Miss those days. I believed in humanity then.Then I met people and became an Audioslave song.
