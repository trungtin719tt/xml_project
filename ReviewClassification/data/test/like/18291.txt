This is the series that started it all for me. I was in 5th grade and hated reading, but then we had the choice of reading either A Wrinkle in Time or the Lion, Witch and the Wardrobe. Out of 3 classes of students reading only 5 of us chose Wrinkle because we were told it was hard to read. Apparently they were quite convincing, which makes me think they didn't like the book. It wasn't easy, but I felt special being in the small group and I was determined to succeed. I really liked the book. I also really liked the rest of the series, although some were a little odd. Then I had the pleasure of teaching this book in 6th grade and I made my students listen to the tapes every year for the whole book. Pure bliss! Anyhow, I thought I'd share a little background about the book that sparked my love for reading.
