It very seriously makes me sad that there are people that haven't read Invisible Monsters. Invisible Monsters is the most amazing work of art I have ever experienced and reading it for the 3rd time was the best decision I have made this summer. Of course, this is the remix version, so it was different than the original Invisible Monsters but mainly just in the formatting and some added chapters.* If you haven't read Invisible Monsters before and you decide to read it, I would recommend the original version. This version was Chuck Palahniuk's original vision for this novel. It reads like a Vogue. At the end of the prologue it says, "Now, Please, Jump to Chapter Forty-One." So you flip to page 284. Then turn jump to chapter 1,40, and so on and so on so that you you are going back and forth after each chapter. And when you finish the book you realize that there are still chapters left that you didn't read. There's 6 chapters actually that aren't really part of the main story. And two of the chapters are published with flipped text so that you have to put the book up to a mirror in order to read them. All of his 'gimmicks' make sense and are really interesting but maybe I'm just a lazy reader because I thought it kind of detracted from the reading experience. Some of the extra chapters were short 'stories' on a few of the characters and some of them told more about Chuck's background and his experience writing Invisible Monsters years ago.* I did like that this edition was hardcover and even if the chapter jumping wasn't my favorite thing to do, I like his ideas and I like the fact that he'll do something different.* Ultimately, this is the best book ever (other than the original version), and reading Invisible Monsters for the first time was one of the most significant points in my life and led to so much for me.Edit: Sorry, there are a few more extra chapters than I originally thought, so make sure to look through the book a few times for all the extra chapters I guess.
