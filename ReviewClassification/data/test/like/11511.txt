"But-oh God! Did she tell ye how it happened?" -Jamie Fraser"Yes. I'll tell you the gory details later." -Claire FraserThat little snippet of dialogue pretty much sums up this entire book. IT WAS FREAKING AWESOME! I admit that I really was starting to lose interest in this series afterThe Fiery Crossbecause it was just so boring, but this one really made up for it in SPADES. Oh, the drama! The scandal! The gossip! The sex scenes were better! The dialogue and jokes were better! At times, I felt like I was watching a Saturday Night Live sketch. At other times, I teared up at how touching the interaction of the Fraser/MacKenzie family is and how much they stuck together. And there was a lot of action scenes...and a lot of the story was told from the differing POVs of Claire, Jamie, Bree and Roger. It wasn't JUST The Diary of Claire Fraser...today, I planted lettuce, tomorrow I will clean my surgery, etc. It was really great and there are so many things that you never see coming. So many times in this book I was like, OMG did that just happen!? And it was REALLY cool to read the beginning of the Revolutionary War from the perspective of people who had only read about it in history books. I don't know. This one is my favorite afterOutlanderandDragonfly in Amber, no question. I haven't been so wrapped up and engrossed in the world of Jamie and Claire since I readVoyager. And I am shocked because I had heard that book 6 was really really long and slow and boring, but damn if I didn't tear through it in less than four days. I couldn't even put it down for a break! Written so well...humorous and touching dialogue...have I mentioned the drama? It was like watching the Jerry Springer show in Diana Gabaldon's words set against the Revolutionary War time in North Carolina. I cried...oh, I cried! And I laughed so hard at times. Just look at my tags on this book and you can see how poor Jamie would be so scandalized by what was happening on his Ridge!I. Loved. It. If you are iffy about continuing on with the series after the slow pace ofDrums of AutumnandThe Fiery Cross, just do what I did...chalk upThe Fiery Crossto this:(view spoiler)[Claire and Jamie obviously were on a downcycle, Brianna couldn't think about anything without letting down her milk, and well, if I were almost hanged, I'd probably be in a pissy mood like Roger was too. No wonder no one was having any sex or any fun or making any jokes.(hide spoiler)]Then just regardThe Fiery Crossas necessary research and background reading for the rest of the series. I do have to say that(view spoiler)[the Back To The Future moment at the end was an especially cool touch...really liked that one!(hide spoiler)]Well done, Mrs. Gabaldon...WELL DONE! I will be startingAn Echo in the Bonetomorrow and then I'll be able to finally be in the boat with all of the other Outlander fans breathlessly awaiting the release of the eighth book.
