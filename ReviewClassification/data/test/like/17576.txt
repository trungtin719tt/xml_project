Still funny, still absurd, still pretty deep really, but Adams was definitly starting to lose some of the threads here. This is the first one where I found myself asking, "wait, what?". There are some pretty decent time jumps between chapters that will leave eyebrows waggling in confusion. But, there ARE still some really great pieces, I'm particularly fond of bistro math.
