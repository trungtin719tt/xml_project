I am a liar and a thief. Don't let me into your house, and if you do, don't leave me alone. I take things. You can catch me with your string of fine pearls clickering in my greedy little paws, and I'll tell you they reminded me of my mother's and I just had to touch them, just for a second, and I'm so sorry, I don't know what came over me.Libby Day's entire family was slaughtered, and she fingered her brother as the murderer. Locked up and far out of sight, Libby is 'living' her life... as much 'living' you can do when your father is a drugged up alcoholic, your brother a murderer and the people you love buried six feet under.It's called "Dark Places" and lives up to its name. It's dark, violent, gripping and, yes, even sick.There were some points in the book that had my stomach churning, and I had to put it down, take deep breaths and count to ten.This isn't just about Satan worshipping, sacrifices or drugs and sex, but also rape, paedophilia, and abuse.It's pretty much all the nasties you can find in the world, rolled onto paper.Do not read this if you can't handle the themes.It's dark and disturbing, and you won't find an inch of happiness in this book. Nothing about it isgood: Libby's afflictions are disturbing, Ben's (her brother) side of the story is even MORE disturbing. From a scale of 0 toFucked Up,Dark Placesis "Way Fucked Up".So Libby's trying to live her life, except she's running out of money, and needs to do something about that, fast."What about new donations -- the twenty-fifth anniversary is coming up." I felt another splash of anger, for him making me say this aloud. Ben started his killing spree around 2 a.m. on January 3, 1985. The time stamp on my family's massacre, and here I was looking forward to it. Who said things like that? Why couldn't there have been even $5,000 left?Don't make any mistake: Libby is not a nice person. I struggled, at first, to like her because she's just soawfulandcruel. But as you walk through her life, it becomes pretty hard to not see why she is the way she is.And then, out of the blue, someone offers her help."Well, you know how some guys do fantasy football, or collect baseball cards?" I nodded. He let out a strange laugh and continued. "Or women read gossip magazines and they know everything about some actor, know like, their baby's name and the town they grew up in?"I gave a weary incline of the head, a be-careful nod."Well, this is like that, but it's, well, we call it a Kill Club."I took a slug of beer, sweat beads popping on my nose."It's not as weird as it sounds.""It sounds pretty fucking weird."The Kill Club offers her money in exchange of investigation on her behalf. They believe Ben is innocent and, no matter how hard she insists he isn't, they want to show her exactly why she's wrong.The book is split in three point-of-views: Pat, Libby's mother, Ben, her brother, and Libby.You jump from past to present, slowly piecing together the story as Libby does. I'm not going to lie, Flynn is an absolute genius and whilstGone Girlwas just "okay" in my eyes, this one rocked my socks off. The story line is addicting, the characters are all wrapped up in secrets and lies, and when it hits the climax, you might as well have been smacked in the face with a shovel because, although I imagined it, I still struggled to see it coming.Definitely recommend!Also -- a movie is coming out in 2015! I'm so excited, I could die.Heh.Pre-ReviewHoly fucking shitballs, what an insane, twisted, unbelievable ride.I have not felt this strongly about a book sinceIn the Woodsand I have still not recovered from that.ASDFGHJKL.Semi coherent review to come.No promises.
