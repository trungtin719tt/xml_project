My Mom gave me the Book of Mormon as a gift to me when I was still a student at Seattle University. I reading it off and on for the next week or so and determined that it was an obscure history book with weird names, place-names and events and in fact could even have been written by a science fiction writer (especially after reading about the role of the Liahona - a current-day device that must have been a GPS of some sort powered by mental focus). It also sounded so much like the King James Version of the Bible in places that I couldn't help but think the author had been taught with that book.The history of the Nephites and Lamanites were typical stories of the rise and fall of nations - all explained by the book as occurrences of falls from righteousness and conversions to righteousness. To me, it sounded a lot like an amateur's attempt to put a spiritual face on historical events and so I put it down and forgot about it for many years.I picked it up again years later at the encouragement of a crippled banker I had met at a financial seminar held in Provo, Utah. The seminar was not that interesting and he recommended that I read it again but "this time", he said, "pray and ask God if the book is true or not. Sit down, clear your head and ask your heavenly father to allow the spirit to teach you the truths of this history book and if it is true at all, you will get a warm familiar feeling and your focus will be single-minded. If it isn't correct, you will feel nothing different. But if you don't pray about it first, sincerely, in your heart with an open mind and heart, then you may feel nothing. Only your private spiritual effort will allow you to be in the frame of mind to read it through".So I did and yes, what he told me was correct. I spent more than two weeks totally and spiritually absorbed in the Book of Mormon. The spiritual lessons learned by the various kings and rulers and characters in the book became real as I placed myself in their shoes and observed my life, my struggles, my accomplishments and my spiritual distresses as results of my dependence on myself and the worldly things surrounding me. Things such as my preoccupation with money and career and my own shortcomings as a man. Things I believed to be controllable if I had the right training, the right exercises, the right positive 'can do' mental attitude.The Book of Mormon helps me to realize that I was on the wrong track; or rather I was doing many good things but for the wrong reasons. I continue to read it today - but perhaps with more depth of understanding - thanks to others in my Church: leaders and members like myself - who have testified how they too learned important life lessons from the characters and stories in the book and how it remains a reminder of how what we do now affects our destiny and how Jesus, the Christ, the annointed one has played an all important role in our salvation. I highly recommend anyone to site down by yourself, and ask God to allow his spirit to permeate your own soul and open your mind to the lessons the book contains before and as you read it.
