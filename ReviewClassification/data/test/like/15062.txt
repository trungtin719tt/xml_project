'Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry' is a book about racism in America during the Great Depression. During reading this book, it made me feel anxious that the idea of racism, judgment, criticism, and stereotypes are existing in our society. I feel bad for the people who are considered different from us just by how they look, what their race is, and what their skin color is. I wish that it will be gone forever. With a sudden flash, BOOM. NO RACISM. Everyone is treated fairly. Everyone is equal. That's my dream society. That's my hope and wish that might happen in the future. However, I know that this is what cannot happen in reality. People's thoughts. Our thoughts about people who have different aspects and characteristics should change. It is our thoughts that are making people in our society being judged and criticized. We need to start thinking in another way about people, humans. That is how we can finish racism. I thought to myself while reading, "When will racism end? When will the idea of racism be gone and be broken in our society?", and I think that the answer is that, racism and criticism of people who are different from "normal" people will never end. It will last as long as it can. Forever. Until we come to a day when everyone starts to abandon the thoughts and stereotypes and make a new society where there is no racism existing.
