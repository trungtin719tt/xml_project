"Birdsong" follows Englishman Stephen Wraysford from a prewar intense relationship with a married French woman to the battlefield of the Somme. The horror of World War I is shown in a realistic manner involving all the senses. In his own way each soldier must deal with the trauma of trench warfare, or digging in the dark, narrow, claustrophobic tunnels under enemy lines.There is a second thread to this book set in the 1970s involving Stephen's granddaughter, Elizabeth. She is trying to decipher some of Stephen's diaries written in code. There are events in her life that run parallel to her grandparents' prewar life which are more acceptable in 1970s society.The descriptions of the events in Stephen's life, especially during the war, were excellent. While the plotline set in the 1970s was not as strong, it did offer the reader some relief from the soldiers' constant exposure to filth, fear, sickness, and death.
