I saved this book to read during the week of my 60th birthday as I have so enjoyed the authors previous writing and I wanted a really good read to mark the week. I was not disappointed. It is an outstanding achievement to visit a theme so comprehensively covered by generations of other writers and discover new insights, new revelations and illuminate a subject in a way previously unknown. The book is a perfect balance of current affairs, history, travel, biography and autobiography that makes for a truly enriching reading experience. An outstanding read, highly recommended.I purchased the hardcover version and it was worth it, the paper and print quality are great and it feels wonderful to hold. This is definitely a book I intend to keep in my library.
