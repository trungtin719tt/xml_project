Something like 7 and 8 stories in the two Jungle Books. Most surprising thing reading the first jungle book was that most of the stories didn't have Mowgli in them. Overall, though, he just won out with a total of 8 stories in the 15 total featuring him. The second Jungle Book might have been a little stronger than the first. The non-mowgli stories were a little varied in quality, and like a number of other such collections a bit of a reading break between the stories here and there helps. But overall there's a wonderful liveliness to all the creatures.
