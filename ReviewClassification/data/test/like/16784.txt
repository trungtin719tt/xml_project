*Actually 4.5 stars**No spoilers*Not writing a big review for this one. So one problem I've had with this series is that it's failed to leave me gobsmacked. Don't get me wrong, it is really good, and I like everything that happens more or less, but after I put the books down after a reading session it isn't leaving me sat holding my head together to keep my mind from blowing. Does that make sense?This one was gonna be another 4 star book until the ending. The end battle scene was just so great and I could imagine it vividly - it was really the highlight of the whole book so far. While the overall outcome was pretty obvious to me, the journey to getting there was well written and a bit unpredictable at times.Puck will always be my favourite character in this series. Always! :D
