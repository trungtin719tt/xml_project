Buddy read withVendi. Thank you &lt;3Clan of the Cave Bear, the first book, is one of my recent favourites. It's so well-imagined and unique, and completely took me out of my daily life. The second book accomplished the same, in some ways, and I really enjoyed reading it for the most part, but something was missing, and some flaws weren't easy to overlook.The first book had very little dialogue, because the Clan (Neanderthals) didn't speak verbally. I liked their nuanced speech using hand gestures. Despite the ingrained misogyny in their species, I liked that there were clear, structured customs for Ayla (our main character) to navigate and challenge.In this book, we still have Ayla, out on her own, as well a new character, Jondalar. They have separate POVS, and his was so different from Ayla's in the first book that it was kind of jarring at the beginning. Soon though, he became boring. All of his chapters, without fail, revolved around sex, as well as some subtle racism towards the Neanderthals. And then there's the whole(view spoiler)[ trying not to force her bits near the end. I'm sure it was a figure of speech, but not a very tasteful one to say the least.(hide spoiler)]Also, you want me to believe that neither the cro magnons nor the neanderthals knew how babies are made?I still enjoyed Auel's writing, despite it being a bit silly. She's good at conjuring up some vivid imagery, and despite much of the plot requiring some serious suspension of disbelief, the characters' emotions are believable and never fail to make me feel something.This is probably just shy of a 4-star rating for me.
