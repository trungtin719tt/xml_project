All that drama and feelings! It was really great.Uploaded withImageShack.usMarie Lu has done a wonderful job taking June and Day from being two infatuated teens to full blown love. I am so very, very happy with this series ending. Lu outdid herself in the feelings and plot department.Marie Lu has really grown as a writer, she portrays feelings on a much deeper level and her abilities to flesh out the subtle intricacies of June and Day's relationship have grown. Champion no longer hinge on action scenes and June and Day interacting, it now had a plot and a growing sense of urgency.I don't want to spoil the ending or points of tension for anyone but let me tell any of the die hard fans out there just this; There is nothing to be afraid of, buy this book and enjoy it!
