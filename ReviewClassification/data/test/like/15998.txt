Update: Kindle $1.99 special today! If you've never experience David Levithan --this is a wonderful book ---(for teens and adults who feel like 'teens'...haha)What would it be like to wake up in a different body every day? And what would it be liketo be in love with a person who changed every day?What makes us fall in love--and what makes us who we are?These are the questions at the heart of this novel... a touching story.Everyone longs for human connection, but 16 year old *A's* search for it seems to be losingproposition. Every day he wakes up in a different body, ( sometimes a girl. an athlete, or different ethnicity, obese, wealthy, middle class, bi, black, white, drug addict, Academic overachiever, meticulously neat, a person with suicidal thoughts, .... or any combinations of these attributes).*A's* awareness that he/she is never himself/herself.*A's* world changes when he/she falls in love with Rhiannon. Things become difficult, of course,once Rhiannon learns of *A''s* unique circumstance. It's hard to fault her. Part of the comfort of loving a person is a person's familiar presence.... And even their physical attraction.The struggle that these two must reconcile what they both want is poignant yet still veryhopeful.By the end of this bittersweet novel... your heart may feel split... because pure love involvescompromise, selflessness, and sacrifice. Yet there are many lessons to be found - comfort--and beauty!*A* is a teen hero. He reminds us that no matter how bright, well adjusted socially, athletic,talented, ... no teen is 100% comfortable in their own skin at all times. It's a period of constantchange, growth and development.There are qualities that this young 16 year old has that is inspiring to us all: he/sheis unbiased, nonjudgmental, considerate, and loyal. He makes mistakes too...yet... he stillseems like a wonderful person...,(despite some crappy people he has been). From 'learning...he try's to be helpful if he notices something going terribly wrong. He wants to be a better person from all he has experienced.Rhiannon is an important character. More controversial. Not as likeable ( on the surface), as *A*- but I felt I understood her. I understood what she was struggling with. I don't think she wanted to 'have' to be made to feel less than-- if her morals were not at the same high standard as *A*.At times it seemed *A* was much too obsessed with Rhiannon... Yet, if you were 16, never fully having your own life, and falling hard in love for the first time-- ( always being the stranger..the different one...almost a ghost...because nobody really knows who you are), might notyou behave a little obsessively for the person you loved?Wonderful book... It was great to step outside of societal roles and experience the world fromsomeone who was gender neutral.... but also didn't have the comfort of stability in his dailylife.I've already started the second book: "Another Day". David Levithan prefers to call it a twin book. Closely related but having its own identity. The book can stand alone. ( it's not necessary to have read this book, but I'm glad I did).
