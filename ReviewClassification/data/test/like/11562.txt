First things first. In the blurb of this book it says..The Fault in Our Stars meets Eleanor and Park. That should go. I liked both those books in their own right. This book should and does stand on it's own. It's better than that.This review may go all spoilery and too much personal information. Be warned.My writing of reviews have been said to be Awkward..fuck that. I'm going all in on this one. If I can get one person that needs to read this book to read it through my review..it's worth it."May you eye go to the Sun, To the wind your soul.." "Or go to the waters if it suits thee there."Theodore Finch:That odd boy who tries on different personalities hoping to find one that will put him into "Awake" mode. He knows so many ways to die and little things keep him from going through with it. It might be that he doesn't want a destroyed corpse for people to look on. It might be that he finally met that girl that is maybe the one that might keep him there.Violet Markey:Recently lost her best friend/sister in a car crash. She is broken. No more cheerleading, writing on her webpage, no more wanting to go to college...she just is.These two meet when both of them are on the ledge to the bell tower at school. Contemplating the reasons that it hurts to bad to go on. Finch steps up and talks to Violet. The word around high school becomes that she saved him.Later a class project comes up that means they have to partner up with someone and "wander" their state. Finch nominates Violet to be his partner and our story begins.This book does move slowly at times. I thought at first it would be a 3/4 star book. Then it snuck up on me and I think it became part of my memories.This book deals with depression and mental illness. It's not one that you can just walk away from.The thing I know about bipolar disorder is that it's a label. One you give crazy people. Labels like "bipolar" say This is why you are the way you are. This is who you are. They explain people away as illnesses.....................................................................I get into these moods sometimes, and I can't shake them. Kind of black sinking moods. I imagine it's like what being in the eye of a tornado would be like, all calm and blinding at the same time. I hate them.Finch's dad obviously suffers from those same type of moods. He turns abusive with them. He has found a new family though and moved on with his life. Which just hurts Finch more.My mom has un-diagnosed bipolar disorder. She can be the sweetest woman you ever met and then it happens. She can be very abusive. Is it her fault? No, but it does make life harder to live with her. I left home at the age of 15 because I was scared of her. My sister and I both have tried to get her help. She goes into the doctors offices and becomes the "sweet woman"..and they never listen to either of us about her moods. My dad passed away last month and I thought we were stable with her...then she told the funeral director that she only had one daughter and shut me out of the room. Does it hurt? Absolutely. Do I hold it against her? I can't. I have to let it go. She has a sickness..one I hope that she will find help with eventually. (No, I'm not a doctor nor do I play one on tv. We just want her tested)What a terrible feeling to love someone and not be able to help them.Actually, I know exactly how that feels.I'm so glad this book was written. Suicide and mental illness needs discussed. It doesn't need to be that dirty little secret that is pushed into the black hole of a closet.I feel like I could quote you this whole sweet, funny, heartbreaking, wonderful book. I won't though. Just go and read it.According to Mental Health America, an estimated 2.5 million Americans are known to have bipolar disorder, but the actual number is a good two to three times higher than that. As many as 80 percent of people with this illness go undiagnosed or misdiagnosed. If you think something is wrong, speak up. You are not alone.I received an arc copy of this book from Netgalley in exchange for an honest review. Thank you so much.
