When I first picked up this book, I was 13, and expecting to be insulted by some white guys going on about how barbaric my culture and history were and how the magnanimous British civilized us all. I was, thankfully, wrong.It follows Mr Fielding, Miss Adela, and Mrs Moor as they come to tour India. They are shown about by Dr Aziz, a poor Muslim, and Adela's fiance Mr Moor. The basic storyline is one of Adela and Mrs Moor touring India, but then Adela eventually convicts Dr Aziz of sexual harassment which he denies.However, the book has much more heart. It delicately shows the impossibility of the British and Indians reconciling through the fading friendship between this group of people. It explores beliefs and meaningfulness. It explains how impossible it is for the white men to fully understand India and its people. It just seems to involve every possible perspective on colonial India in rich, resonant detail.Forster writes with an almost native understanding of the Indian subcontinent. It is a very very sensitive and poignant portrayal of India and is written with an unbiased honesty. While the British are shown as the more cultured, they are also haughty, foolish and greedy. While the Indians are shown as warm, family-loving and hospitable beings their tendencies to be crude, quarrelsome and religiously divisive are highlighted as well. Through this setting traverse three characters new to India- and their fresh perspective adds a new and naive point of view to the book. I highly recommend it for anyone.
