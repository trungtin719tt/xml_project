My Mom bought me The Jungle Book from her school and for years I didn't read it.Not until the summers of 2015 came and I promised myself that I'm going to complete that years' Goodreads' challenge. After reading the book, I remembered the days I used to watch the animated version on TV.Everything was perfect. Thank you Rudyard Kipling.
