Howards Endis Forster's attempt to explore the social, political, cultural and philosophical changes that were at force at the turn of the 20th century. Using three families - the Wilcoxes, the Schlegels and the Basts, he writes an intricate story expounding the changes that were slowly engulfing England during the Edwardian era.The three families Forster has used for his story represents three sectors. The Wilcoxes are the solid, materialistic and practical imperialists. They are the rich upper middle class who keep the economic wheel of England going and who controls the working ethics. They represent more or less the Victorian conventional rigidity. The Schlegels are the intellectual and cultural idealists. They are a different sector of upper middle class. They represent the modern visionary. And the Basts represent the underprivileged or rather "victimized" lower middle class who lack the wealth and culture to better them. Through his story Forster forces these three families on one another and exposes the class difference and inherent hypocrisy of the conventional rich.Forster favoures the themes of class difference and hypocrisy and as I've already mentioned they play a major role inHowards Endtoo. This is very much expressed through Wilcoxes treatment towards the Schlegels and the Basts, and at times Schlegels treatment towards Basts. But the most important theme was the philosophical debate on what was life? Was it the outer world of "telegrams and anger" as Forster called it or the inner world of personal relations and emotions? Margaret Schlegel thinks the life's glory is "only to connect" meaning the connection with people personally and emotionally while Henry Wilcox thinks that only "concentration" which is the rigid, conventional and emotionally devoid conduct of outer world is the "real life". This was quite an interesting and in depth debate of which Forster chooses the winner to be the philosophy of "connecting".One criticism against Forster is that the characters he brings into his novels are not likable. This was perhaps true inA Passage to Indiabut in bothA Room with a ViewandHowards Endsuch criticism is groundless. InHowards Endthe personal growth of the characters developed and altered their personalities so much that at the end I was able to like them very much. However, out of all I favoured the Schelgel sisters - the strong but emotional and romantic Margaret and the emotional yet impulsive Helen. I also ended up liking the rigid, emotionally devoid and hypocritical Henry Wilcox who was properly humbled by reason of personal tragedy.There was a lot of symbolism at play in the novel. And so much of importance was given to the different houses through which the personalities of the characters were expressed. Howards End, the property on which the novel derives the title, was practically a symbol for England. Written at a time when England was slowly coming out of convention and moving towards liberalism, Forster raises the question to whom England belong? Howards End finally belongs to Henry, Margaret, Helen and Helen's son from Leonard Bast. And symbolically this indicates of a merging of classes obscuring the boundaries. This perhaps was Forster's prophecy as to the collapse of the class system in the future.And it is also noteworthy to mention at this point that it was Margaret Schlegel/Wilcox who unites the opposing factions at the end. It is as if Forster saw a woman or rather women as being the deciding factor in changing the conventional English society in to a more liberal and tolerant one. Forster was one of the early feminists and his feminist perspective is clearly displayed here.Finally it would be quite amiss if I don't comment on Forster's writing. It is exquisite. The poetic and flowery prose and the beautiful metaphors made it an exceedingly pleasurable read. The colourful and picturesque description made the writing more in line with the Victorian time. I felt Forster's writing in theHowards Endto be a tribute to the great Victorian literature.The reading was absolutely a pleasure. I enjoyed it very much. Many say thatHowards Endis Forster's masterpiece. And I heartily agree.
