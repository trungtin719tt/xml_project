Origin is a turning point in Lux series. This is not a childlish game anymore. Everything is more dangerous and more serious than ever before. Everyone had to pick sides and say goodbye to the content life they once had known. Full of action, Origin is the best part in series so far!My Daemon:My Katy:I loved dual POV. In this book,Daemonis in his best confident-self. He is snarky. He is determined. He will doANYTHINGto get his Kitten back. I absolutely loved how badass Daemon was in this instalment, he is definitely one of my all time favourite bookish heroes, if not the best!I was shocked and speecheles once I found out what "origin" truly means.Action in this book blew my mind!Lux series is without a doubt the best YA paranormal series I have ever read, it is just so epic! I could not put it down, Origin was pure perfection.And Katy's and Daemon's relationship? It matured, got stronger and I was swooning over them all the time. I loved everything about this book. The good, the bad, everything. Kudos toJennifer L. Armentroutfor creating this amazing story. I wish I had final instalment already!***********************************************************My pre-review after readingOpal:I HAVE NEVER EVER WANTED ANY BOOK SO MUCH AS I WANT THIS ONE.
