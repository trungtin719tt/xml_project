This was my first Sarah Dessen book, and after years of hearing people rave about her writing, I have to it admit, my expectations were pretty high. Buut, they were also met!I don't read contemporaries very often, but I was really feeling one at the time. (I'm also going to be meeting Sarah Dessen at NTTBF later on this month) I own five of her books and so I went to my shelves and looked at all the different synopsis's trying to decide which sounded best, and this one hit the nail on the head. And so I picked it up one night and finished it two days later.These characters and the story felt so real; it dealt with some difficult topics, but the author didn't sugar coat or shy away from them. The characters have been through a lot of terrible things and this just shows that you can come back from that, and that it is possible to heal. I loved the development all of these characters went through, how they interacted with each other and built one other up.The main theme of the book was family; what family means to each person individually. It was beautiful to see this theme woven throughout the storyline in such a flawless way.I HIGHLY recommend checking this book out, I had such an enjoyable time reading it and connecting with all of these incredibly unique characters. I can't wait to pick up more of Sarah Dessen's novels in the future whenever I'm in need of a good contemporary kick!What are some of your favorite SD novels?
