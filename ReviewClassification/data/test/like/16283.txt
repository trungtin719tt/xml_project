"I am ashamed that women are so simpleTo offer war where they should kneel for peace,Or seek for rule, supremacy, and sway,When they are bound to serve, love, and obey."-- William Shakespeare, Taming of the Shrew, Act V, 2The second play in my First Folio journey is 'The Taming of the Shrew'. The obvious discussion surrounding this play has to be Shakespeare's views, as expressed in this play, of women. I think any defense of Shakespeare's attitudes are silly. Shakespeare was a contradiction, especially towards women. Some of his best characters and lines are delivered by women. They are often strong, strong-willed, intelligent, cunning, etc., but he also obviously falls/dips into the attitudes of his time (late 16th century). I am less concerned with Shakespeare's attitudes towards women than I am about Trump's or the Duggars and that ilk. Actually, I probably side more with Harold Bloom, who thought the bard clearly preferred women to men (excepting Hamlet and Falstaff) on this issue.The other piece that might get overlooked in Shakespeare's second play is how early in his career Shakespeare is completely bending the structure of his plays. This one is basically a play within a play (later to be repeated in Hamlet and others) and most of the players in the play in a play are playing parts. Oooo Meta. So, while I'm not thrilled with some of the attitudes (and I think those are more of his characters' attitudes and not his) the dialogue and characters are great. The play within a play, however interesting served no great purpose that I could figure out.Reading this play alarms me not because of any attitudes it expresses, but because in almost 400+ years, many haven't moved that far FROM those sexist attitudes. So, as far as Kate is concerned. I'm with HER!There were also several nice lines, specifically:- "And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy."- "Affection is not rated from the heart."- "That being mad herself, she's madly mated."- "And do as adversaries do in law,Strive mightily but eat and drink as friends."
