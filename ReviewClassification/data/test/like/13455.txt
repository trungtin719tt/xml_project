The Gargoyle moves you to want to be in love and to NEVER want to be in love. Love is suffering, love is bliss. Davidson has penned a beautiful book full of love, meaning, and intelligence. It's not often that a person can learn history,religion and culture in a book about love. Oh and he threw in burn procedures, yes BURN procedures in a book about love, somehow it seems fitting. Wait, I think I forgot to mention there are language translations too. I do realize a lot of people run from anything that can further their knowledge, that's what school texts are for, but his book is so enchanting that you don't even realize how much you're absorbing until you come to the end. The end,that awful place I did not want to arrive. I longed to stay forever immersed in this story. Breathtakingly original, descriptions that lead you into a journey of pain (yes my skin crawled when I read about the burns), and how beautifully he tied the stories of love together into a tight knot. I will say this book is graphic but it had to be, or it wouldn't be a powerful read that haunts you long after you're done. I stayed up for many nights as if possessed, and few books have mesmerized me like The Gargoyle.Read it, re-read it,cling to it and spread the word!
