I just listened to the audio of "The Great Divorce." It was my first reading of this book, and I know there will be many re-readings in my future. I feel a first reading was really just a glimpse of what it will be like to delve into it again and again. First of all, I must say that I adore Lewis's writing style and that his stories really resonate with me. And I know I'm just beginning to touch the surface. I have read Narnia a couple times and I read "The Problem with Pain" last year. I'm eager to continue venturing into his writings. His Christian perspective is inspiring and is quite a good fit to my own ideas/musings/wonderings/beliefs.My favorite part of "The Great Divorce" :In great anguish, a woman declares, "I'd rather die!"She is reminded, "You are already dead."In further anguish, she cries out, "Then I wish I were never born!! What are we born for??"She is answered, "For infinite happiness. You can step out into it at any moment."The idea of happiness always being accessible, always being available, is beautiful. We don't have to wait for heaven. It's already here...
