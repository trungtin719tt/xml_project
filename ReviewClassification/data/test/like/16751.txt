3.5 stars rounded up because I recognize the importance of this work as part of the literary canon I just didn't love it. This is my 3rd book by E.M. Forster and my least favorite. I had a hard time getting into this. To be honest I found the beginning to be a bit of a slog and if I hadn't been reading this as part of a challenge I may not have finished it. BUT, I'm really glad I did because it all comes together nicely in the end. I listened to the audio which was a good choice for me. It pulled me through the more (to me) tedious parts. At the start there are many many characters to keep track of and I found it hard to form any relationships with them. I really liked the way the author showed both sides of the conflict. I also really enjoyed the absolutely gorgeous depictions of India. I'm looking forward to reading more by this author.
