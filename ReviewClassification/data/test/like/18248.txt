This was SO GOOD AHHH small child me would have adored it. Big me just hummed along ('cause big me actually knew about the Azerbaijan dispute and the common vetch. ;) ) I loved solving the puzzles before the kids got to them, though it DID take me a ridiculously long time to get Mr. Benedict's first name. I, being the child who memorized entire textbooks on code, learned Ojibway and two other code languages to chat with friends, and wrote entire journals crammed full of codes I have now forgotten, tried 'most a hundred code tricks on that letter of his before I realized the book was written for slightly more normal small humans and found the answer glaring at me when I slammed the book shut. Ugh.ANYWAY. This was almost as good asMistress Masham's Repose, without having Lilliputians, which is saying something.
