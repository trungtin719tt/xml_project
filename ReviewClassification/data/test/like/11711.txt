As usual in a Kingsolver book the writing inProdigal Summeris just beautiful and the descriptions lyrical. It is a book to read carefully and slowly and just enjoy.Several different stories run parallel and tie up eventually towards the end of the book. I found my interest in each story uneven and tended to rush the parts about Garnett Walker because I became tired of his constant, repetitive musings and I wanted to get back to Deanna or Lusa. However I never rushed any of their parts:)The author has a very strong philosophy on life which always runs through her novels but in this one she does rather get on her soap box, and I did occasionally feel she was trying to brow beat me into submitting to her views (and I am already a believer!). For me this loses the book one star.Nevertheless it was a lovely read with some charming characters, very human behaviours and a positive, hopeful ending.
