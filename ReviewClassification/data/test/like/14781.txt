This was a life changing sort of read. There is an underlying theme to this book which is... 'take time out to appreciate the people you love the most'. So cliche - but this is the strong concept I grasped from this book.This was so well written by a deranged madman of an author that I am dying to get to know more about. I plan to read every last one of his books.This is like a train wreck of a memoir, slowly metamorphing into a sci fi horrific fascinating story. It is pretty dramatic and heartwrenching at times though it has some witty humor. Kept me on the edge of my seat. At the end of the book I had to sit and marinate for a long time to grasp WTF just happened... and it was truly life changing. :)
