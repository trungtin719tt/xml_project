Pat Conroy has done it again! A fantastic 5 star audiobook on cassettes! I could not stop listening to this novel until it was finished! Wow! Thanks to my Goodreads friends who recommended this masterpiece with their excellent reviews. My only regret is that it has taken me until today to find BEACH MUSIC and read it.It is about love, childhood, dysfunctional families, horrors of World War II, abuse, growing up, university days, environmental issues, anti-Vietnam War demonstrations, priesthood, mental illness, leukaemia and death. The beautiful heartfelt writing and mesmerizing language of Pat Conroy drew me deep into this fabulous story.To quote my friend Sharon, "He's skilled at creating characters that step off the page, into your life and linger in your memory."I highly recommend this novel!5 stars
