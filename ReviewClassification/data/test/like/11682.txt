It was while reading this that I finally had an "aha" moment about why it is that observation can change what you're trying to observe. I was always kind of skeptical of this, because I was wondering "what is it that our eyes do that could possibly affect things?" Stephen Hawking set me straight: it's the tiny speck of light that you have to shoot at what you're trying to observe that affects it. Light bulb is on!I have an interest in physics, and I have read quite a few books for the layman about recent physics and cosmology - string theory, the big bang, hyperspace. So I wasn't sure whether I would end up learning something new when I finally got the chance to read this. But it was full of light-bulb moments like the one above - things that I had been wondering about but had never been described in a low-level, concrete sort of way that would make sense for me.Hawking's writing style made this book a wonderful experience, with a friendly, interested tone that brings the reader in while also expressing his own excitement about the topics. It's a good mix of historical notes, explanations of what exactly went on in the experimental work of science, and also what the implications of those developments are in the big picture - not just the big picture of physics and science, but what developments in physics mean for us as human beings and our understanding of the world around us.The only weak part of this book, that left me scratching my head and unable to visualize instead of visualizing and getting it for the first time, were the chapters on subatomic particles. Concepts like spin and what exactly antiparticles ARE in a concrete sense (and how they interact with the particles we are familiar with), are still beyond me after this book, but I'm not sure if that's a weakness in Hawking's great power of explanation, or if it's inherent in those ideas themselves to be difficult!I would recommend this book to absolutely everyone with an interest in the world - you don't have to be a science specialist (I sure am not) or mathematically-inclined to follow it, and it is full of ideas that will make you think (and also understand a lot more of what people are talking about when they reference scientists and concepts from the past).
