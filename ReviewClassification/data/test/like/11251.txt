I saw and enjoyed the movie years ago but the story never gripped me enough to make me hurry to read the book. Now that I have, I'm glad that I did.First, its a great story. It's fast paced and has that energy common to techno-thrillers. Ludlam can certainly hold his own in an arena I'd previously thought of as populated by Tom Clancy alone. The locales and the situations are captivating and the action and tension are riveting.This book's strength (and perhaps its weakness) is the amnesia/mystery that we watch being unraveled. Strength in that it's a great plot, but it's a bit of a weakness as the amnesiac main character keeps us from forming an immediate attachment to the character. He's fascinating, but even he admits, Cain is not really easily lovable. Of course after the first 50 pages or so we do care and the story gets more interesting.This is not my favorite genre but it hooked me nonetheless, I'll most likely pick up and read the next installment but again, I feel no great need to do so immediately.
