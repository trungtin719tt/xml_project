I've read this gem together with sis Bea. You can read her beautiful reviewhere. :)The Indigo Spell has put a spell on me!Once again, Richelle Mead captivated me with yet another amazingBloodlinessequel.This book was overloaded with so many happenings that are very significant and important. In this sequel,Sydney Sagedelved into more dangerous situations-- discovering her magical abilities and even finding out the conspiracies hidden byThe Alchemists.Adrianwas there for her all the time, supporting her and looking after her in every perilous occurrences.Sydney's character became incredible here, though I must say I have mixed feelings with her. She was at times, very stubborn and too reluctant to give in to her heart's desire which is to return Adrian's feelings. Nevertheless, I admire her bravery and her usual critical-thinking that can always make the situations bearable and manageable. Adrian's character was also great. He became more passionate and swoony and a total bae!Theromancein this book was beyond amazing. I mean, who couldn't resist the romantic scenes between Sydney and Adrian? Those scenes absolutely outdid the ones in the previous books. I couldn't stop myself shipping them because it's hard not to. They're too perfect! *sigh And their chemistry!I guess what I truly love about this sequel, apart from the great romantic development, was theaction scenes. Totally amazeballs! Those scenes, especially the one where they were running away from the evil witch, were EPIC! Simply adrenaline-pulling that I found myself truly thrilled.At some point, I found some dragging parts but the remaining chapters saved everything. I was about to rate it 4 stars but Chapters 24 and 25 were a game changer and it's hard to resist it when you're fangirling over everything-- especially when it has something to do withSYDRIAN.Overall, a great sequel! Hands down! The series gets better and more thrilling and I can't wait to find out what will happen inThe Fiery Heart.Rating:
