I kind of cringe to admit I bought this book with my babysitting money and read it when I was 14 thinking it was about a young woman and a horse. The salesclerk valiantly did try to discreetly inform my mom that it wasn't really YA reading, but failed to stress that it was because of the sex. Fortunately my mom was right in that I was mature enough to realize that while I was mature enough for the G-rated portions of the book, the intimate scenes were for adults. Granted when I read the series again in college I didn't hold back at all! *chuckles* Granted, viewing sex as a beautiful sacrament that should be celebrated and treated as something special event that society must see you as ready to participated in (even if it isn't within the current mores of marriage) helped me to wait to have sex until I was much older than I think I might have otherwise been.I have loved the epic saga of series from the first time I read it and still find myself occasionally lost in imagining Ayla and Jondalar's journey and life together, and the alternate paths it could have taken, especially since I now have a horse of my own and am learning Natural Horsemanship. The images of Ayla actually help me a lot, and even gave me some pointers for helping my kids envision what they should be trying for in their own heads.
