This book changed my life. Over and over again. That is the simplest way to put it. One day a girl came into the pizza parlor I was working at and I commented on her tramp stamp. (It was as always, an attempt to get her to lower the jeans) - It was a blue feather tattoo. I asked what it represented and she told me it was the feather from the cover of a book, called "Illusions", and it had changed her life.She brought the book into me as promised a couple days later with a four leaf clover as a book mark.Needless to say, this was my lucky book. And, it happened to be the lucky book of a couple of other people close to me as well.I told my friend about this and he remarked to me that it was fairly coincidental as he had just received this book as a gift from his brother.Years later I recommended past this quirky thing to another good friend of mine, and he promised to put it on the top of his to read list. He found it the next day in a dumpster while looking for some song lyrics he had thrown pout.I know this tells you very little about the content of the book, but like all Bach's works it is sweet and inspirational. I've seen it in the fiction, self help, and religious sections of books stores at it is unclassifiable in its means to reach its audience.This is for young and old. To anyone and to all, may it help shape your life as it has shaped mine.
