Recently I used a quote of P.G. Wodehouse in my recent review about a criminal carefully plotting his crime in a village only to realize both Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot stay there. The quote in more appropriate here, but now it is too late.Hercule Poirot retired to a quiet British village to grow vegetable marrows. Soon he realized something lots of retired people realized before and after him: retirement is very boring unless you plan what you are going to do carefully in advance. Growing marrows is NOT exciting.In the meantime people in the village began dropping dead like flies in fall. First there was a woman who died of seemingly natural causes. The next guy called Roger Ackroyd was undoubtedly (and quite unsurprisingly - see the title) murdered. Poirot was begged to investigate and he could not refuse. What followed is a very complicated mystery.The narrator of this story is the village doctor: James Sheppard. I like him more than Capt. Hastings. He seemed more colorful and under his narration the people of the village came alive. I loved his sister (with her minions) who was specializing as a local gossip.Hercule Poirot himself is never unexciting.The story was great, the mystery was complicated, and even minor characters were not boring. Why 4 stars when the book is regarded as Agatha Christie's one of the finest by majority of reviewers? Because the Grand Dame cheated: she broke one of the most basic rules of the Golden Age of Mystery to make the mystery even more complicated.People that read the book know what I am talking about. I cannot clearly explain the details as to do it I would have to reveal the identity of the villain and anybody who does it for Agatha Christie novel should expect a lynching mob on their doorstep. I would. Luckily she has never done it again.
