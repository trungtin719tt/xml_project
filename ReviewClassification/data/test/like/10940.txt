This was less of a book and more of a roller coaster. You know how you sometimes get off a roller coaster, and your legs feel like jelly and your middle feels like someone's wringing you dry?I'm not going to give you plot synopses. I'm not going to give you my favourite quotes. I am, however, going to tell you a story. I knew I would love Where She Went before I ever read it. I read a review of the book about a month ago, and it inspired me to stop procrastinating and pull If I Stay out of the TBR pile I had consigned it to. I really liked it. If I Stay, I mean. It didn't blow me away, I didn't need any of the tissues I had kept on stand-by and my feelings towards the book were positive, but lukewarm.But there was one shining, burning beacon in the book that drew me time and again. The one person in the entire book who seemed almostreal, as if he could walk off the pages of the book, and into my life, so I could mend all the broken pieces. Adam was the reason I read If I Stay, and Adam is the reason I read Where She Went.You know how you sometimes just feel like certain characters speak to you? I'm not talking about a literary crush, so much as I am about a level of literary empathy. I could just picture, so clearly, the ruined, devastated Adam who opens this sequel, and it made my heart hurt. As a sort of karmic retribution for my stone-hearted failure to be moved to tears by Mia's plight, I was forced to start sobbing around thirty pages into Where She Went, and I don't think I stopped.There is no way to describe my feelings about this book without sounding crazed. So if men in white coats come to cart me off in a straitjacket, please miss me and like my reviews in memoriam! (Yes even deeply emotional reviews do not stop me plugging my other ones! Also I needed the emotional breather, dammit!)Rage. If there's one primary emotion I felt towards Mia for most of this book, it was the same rage that Adam was consumed by. Oh, I didn't need the big reveal at the end to knowwhyshe broke up with him, or even why she did it so cruelly, but I was still practically incoherent with rage on Adam's behalf. IunderstoodMia, but I still bled for Adam.You know what'sreallyweird about my experience with this book? I could literally feel the chaos in my head building along with Adam. And when he finally lets loose on Brooklyn Bridge and goes through his cathartic moment, I felt calm, too. Is it weird that I practically drowned in this book, or is it just the effect of a really, really good storyteller? For the sake of my sanity, I'm going to assume it's the latter.So, I was practically begging for a non-YA ending, where things are resolved, but not with an HEA.(view spoiler)[ And yet, when they DID get together, I was strangely okay with that. Happy, even. I salute you, Gayle Forman.(hide spoiler)]This book spoke to me so profoundly. About loss. About love. About putting the pieces of yourself back together, but still finding those jagged edges, those bits that won't fit together. It took me on a trip to the dark side of an emotional breakdown, and then it pulled me out of there and put me back on an even keel. There are not too many storytellers out there who can make me lose myself so thoroughly in a story that Ifeelit, rather than simply reading about it. So, in my book, Gayle Forman gets a gold star and a standing ovation, but please excuse me while I go recover with a truly crappy book. I thinkProm and Prejudiceis calling my name. In the meantime, if you want to be a sobbing mess too, please go add Where She Went to your reading pile.
