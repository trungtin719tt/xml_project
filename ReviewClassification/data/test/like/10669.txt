This is supposed to be a full, uncensored version unlike the originals &amp; done by a better translator. According to the foreword, there's not a lot of change, just some sentiments &amp; details that wouldn't have made it originally. It's been too long since I read my old paperback copy for me to tell if that was the same or not, though. It doesn't really matter, this is an incredibly moving &amp; perceptive novel. Since it's a 50 year old classic, I'm not going to worry about spoilers in my review nor do I think they can do anything to harm even a first reading of this novel &amp; may even help.It's moving as the obvious denunciation of the Soviet system, a distorted version of communism that eventually collapsed under its own inefficiencies &amp; excesses. Ivan Denisovich Shukov was one of far too many that had the misfortune to escape capture by the Nazis &amp; make it back to his own lines only to be imprisoned in a gulag, a work camp, for his efforts. We're never really told why, but it was probably so he couldn't spread the word of the horrible defeat his Army unit had suffered &amp; conditions on the front. Perhaps it was just paranoia or quotas, though. In any case, he was sentenced to 10 years, 3653 days (3 to make up for the leap years), &amp; this is just one of those during his 8th year. Hopefully he has less than 2 years to go, but he barely let's himself hope that he'll be that lucky.The corruption &amp; inefficiencies of the system are well shown in day's work detail. They don't actually get to work until halfway through the day without proper tools or materials unless they steal them. Shukov proves that as a farmer, he's handy &amp; makes himself useful. It allows him to make the little extra he needs to survive &amp; enables him to hold on to tatters of his self respect.The other theme running through the book is selfishness of the state &amp; every level below it to the poor zeks like Shukov. Corruption is rampant, a constant factor in every thought since the margin of survival is so thin. A few extra grams of bread can make all the difference. Both the margin &amp; selfishness is made extremely clear in The Captain, a Navy officer who will not survive long in the camp. Shukov never even thinks this directly, but he knows that 1o days in the hole will break The Captain's health &amp; other thoughts have shown just how unfit he is. He hasn't the skills to scavenge or think the way Shukov does.I doubt anyone who reads this book will ever have less than Shukov. It's scary &amp; instructive to see just how resilient a man can be as he finds pleasure in finding a bit metal or fish in his watery stew.I first read this as a teen over 4 decades ago. The Soviet Union was then the only other world power, the country that we half expected to mutually destroy the world with us in a nuclear war. As a teen, I wondered how they could continue with such inefficiencies as I read in this book. About 15 or 20 years later, I found out they couldn't. It didn't change the novel much for me, though.Depressing? Yeah, but also amazing. I can't recommend this book highly enough. It's short, but all the more powerful for that. I vaguely recall drudging through most ofThe Gulag Archipelago 1918-1956decades ago. I don't really recall it several other histories while I've never forgotten this book.Thanks to Tytti in the "History Is Not Boring" group for the recommendation ofIn the Clutches of the Tchekawhich is available from The Internet Archive here:https://archive.org/details/1929InThe...This is a 1929 account by one of the earliest prisoners.
