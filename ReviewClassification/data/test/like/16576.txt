I would like to thank AteAJand AteRachelfor recommending this book to me. (Click their names to read their reviews) This paranormal fantasy novel isfun, quick and entertainingto read. I've listened to the audio book and is narrated by Cris Dukehart (she's really good by the way).When a spell gone bad, a young witch Sophie Mercer was sent to Hecate Hall (Hex Hall) as a punishment of exposing herself to humans. Students consists of young Prodigium or supernatural creatures like vampires, werewolves, fairies, witches etc. Things happened when there are mysterious attacks towards the students and they think Jenna (Sophie's vampire roommate) is responsible for these attacks. Sophie doesn't believe in it and she's about to find out.The setting somewhat reminds me ofHarry Potterand the Hex Hall's history made me curious. It's pretty interesting and I want to know more.Sophie Mercer is such a fascinating character.She's witty, hilarious and sarcastic at its best. This lady made me laugh out loud. As for other characters, all of them are interesting. Especially Archer Cross. Oh how I love this bad boy warlock. Lastly, the plot twist in this book is something I didn't expect. I was like "WHOA! Now, thatisone good twist!" What a great surprise.Overall, I really like this book. I am definitely going to pick up the sequel. If you are looking for a light fantasy novel, give this one a try. :)
