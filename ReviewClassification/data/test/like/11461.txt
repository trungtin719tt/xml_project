Every year, in some fashion, I read this aloud to the kids. What has sold more copies, in more versions? This is one of the old classic illustrated versions, more for me than the kids, in a way, though we had five versions of it around the house this time. Everybody likes it, though this year the now eleven year old mimes some of the action that I describe, lightly making fun of it. He has this idea Santa no longer exists!
