Packed full of laughs, poor Forest just can't do anything right. Quite different from the film, which in this rare instance IS, in my opinion, better than the book. The storyline in the film flows a lot better, but the book is still worth a read. The only thing which I had to become accustomed to, is slowing my reading speed so that the phonetically written dialogue had an authentic slow drawl.
