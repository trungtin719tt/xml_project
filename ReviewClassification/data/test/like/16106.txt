This Book Made Me CryA classmate of mine recommended this book to me when I was looking for a realistic fiction with some romance. Little did I know that this book would be the best I've ever read in this genre. Nicholas Sparks made me want to keep reading and kept me on the edge making me want to read more. Since I hated Richard from the start I was cheering for Mike. At first it was because the dog like Mike and not Richard. I had the same feeling in my gut the entire time and it was later proven. The events that followed the relationship between Julie and Richard was what really made me want to read more. Sometimes I would have to force myself to put it down and go to bed. In the end, I cried for a solid half an hour. This wasn't what I was expecting for a romance, but I loved it even more.
