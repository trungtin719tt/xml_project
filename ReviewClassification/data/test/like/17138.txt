I also read this book when I was younger and enjoyed the silly take on many of these tales. It contains enough jokes for adults to keep this from being yet another mundane, over-read fairy tale book as well. The illustrations are interesting and I enjoyed them very much. This is an excellent book to read over a span of days with each student getting to pick their own story. It will leave students laughing since they're takes on such popular fairy tales but with outlandish endings. I would highly recommend this book.
