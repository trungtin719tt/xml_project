If you're a fan of Graceling, this companion novel set over the mountains to the east of the seven kingdoms will satisfy. The main narrative starring Fire (a half-human/half-monster young woman) is framed by the story of a particular young Graceling who has the ability to control others completely... you'll recognize the future King Leck immediately. Fire has a similar talent, but because of her monster blood she can actually sense what people are thinking rather than simply order them around. Her distinctive monster hair is all colors of red and orange, mesmerizing and enraging people in turns in this strange land so near and yet so far removed from the kingdoms we grew to know so well in Graceling. Fire's story is wrapped around her changing relationship with childhood friend (now lover) Archer and an impending war in which she must navigate various intrigues, and, eventually, face Leck again.This book has a LOT more romance/violence/shades of sexuality than I remembered in Graceling. Plenty of interpersonal drama will make this especially appealing to readers who might not otherwise crave high fantasy. Just as Graceling drew fans of Tamora Pierce and her strong female characters, Fire will definitely do the same. Cashore is wonderful at world-building and shows off her talents to best advantage in this follow-up which will be one of the most-requested books of 2009.
