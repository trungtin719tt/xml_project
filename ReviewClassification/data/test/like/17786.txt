4.5 *I LOVE THIS SERIES, AND BARRONS, AND MAYBE V'LANE A LITTLE TOO* STARS.More action, more suspense, more fear, more doubt, more evil, more darkness; all of these elements sure don't make Mac's life any easier. But while the world is turning more evil, she is gaining more knowledge and strength and one thing she makes sure to never lose is: hope."Hope is a critical thing. Without it, we are nothing. Hope shapes the will. The will shapes the world. I might have been suffering a dearth of hope but I had a few things left: will, desperation in spades, and a chance.""Being touched by Jericho Barrons with kindness makes you feel like you must be the most special person in the world. It's like walking up to the biggest, most savage lion in the jungle, lying down, placing your head in its mouth and, rather than taking your life, it licks you and purrs.""Question: When you're one of the few people who can do something to fix a problem, just how responsible does that make you for it?Answer: It's how you choose to answer that question that defines you."This second part of the series managed to captivate me once again from beginning to end, and it made me an even bigger fan of KMM and the brilliantly created world and characters in this series. It also left me with even MORE questions that I need answers to, so I'm moving on to the next part,Faefever, ASAP!!~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*
