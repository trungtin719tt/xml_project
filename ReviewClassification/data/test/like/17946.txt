As a first Young-Adult novel of the writing team of Mundell &amp; Lacast, we are drawn into Bernard's sensory and atmospheric world with great hopes that there will be a series of journeys to follow.Not unlike experiencing Avatar in a 3D IMAX theater, this exciting and provocative novel includes characters (both in Bernard's outer and inner worlds) and images of such dimension, the reader cannot help but feel fully INVITED into this fantastical storyline.Because of the writing style of BRAINWALKER, the reader is allowed ample "space" to join in every detail &amp; sensory perception."...then I remembered Mom telling me empty space wasn't really empty - it was filled with possibilities."What I like the best about BRAINWALKER is that it employs a uniquely therapeutic modality into each page, into each inhale &amp; exhale of a reader's journey, that equally caresses and stimulates one's mind and heart rate.Too often in Young Adult novels, we as readers are "told" what to think or offered predictable characters and inevitable outcomes. Not so with this writing team - they artistically "point" to possibilities in the most poetic way. We FEEL the piece without working at it, and instead join in the journey effortlessly and in anticipation of each next turn of events.The novel's characters are fully developed and exhibit their challenges as well as redemptive qualities making them easily relatable to all ages.In fact, so broad and important are this novel's messages, I strongly feel it ought to be mandatory school reading for tweens/teens across the country.
