I've somewhat skipped ahead in my reading of Maggie Atwood. I was going in order from the beginning but then I saw this in a charity shop for like a euro and obviously couldn't leave it behind.I've never been a fan of non-realist works of fiction. Hence science fiction doesn't brandish my shelves and you'd actually have to pay me to read fantasy. So I was apprehensive aboutOryx and Crake, the first book in Maggie's trilogy of post-apocalyptic speculative works.The novel begins with Snowman waking up, outdoors. He seems to be the only human being left after some unknown world-ending event. His name isn't actually Snowman, he's Jimmy. Throughout the book we discover who Jimmy is and what part he played in ending the world.The novel flips between Snowman surviving in the new world and flashbacks to his life as Jimmy. When he isn't scavenging, he's musing on life. Slowly we discover who our title characters are, Oryx and Crake, and why the little mutant children who inhabit the former planet Earth with Snowman seem to treat Oryx and Crake as the great creators.I found the novel to be wonderfully balanced. There's two plots happening at once, interspersing between each other, and Maggie handles this beautifully. Oftentimes in books with concurrent plot lines you get somewhat bored with one of them and sigh and moan whenever the novel switches to that plot. That does not happen withOryx and Crake. Maggie has essentially written two great books and mashed them together.I also greatly appreciate that even though this novel isfullof futuristic made-up jargon and somewhat complicated conversations about the nature of genetics, Maggie never makes this a difficult read. I had known what the basic plot was about before reading this novel and honestly, that really put me off. Mutant pigs and rabbits and magic pills and a land segregated by communes. But these things are treated, and written about, as if they were just the status quo. At times I forgot I was reading a dystopia, I was thinking god those awful pigoons, as if they were a real and present danger to my well-being. Usually I would be so cynical about the fantasy of it all, but I wasn't.I really lovedOryx and Crake. Although I'm a bit meh about book series and trilogies, I will definitely be continuing on. The novel gives you a lot to think about. Even Maggie herself said that the novel is essentially a warning against what might eventually happen. And since we seem to be nose-diving deeper into a world akin to Gilead, I'm terrified that even with a novel as strange and terrifying asOryx and Crake, Maggie might once again be right.
