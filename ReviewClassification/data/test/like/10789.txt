NEW REVIEW IN 2014.REASONS YOU NEED THE TRAUMA OF THE GONE SERIES IN YOUR LIFE:1. Humour! Yay! Funniness!I am a complete sucker for funniness. I love laughing. And books that can have me grinning and laughing OUT LOUD? They get a huge shiny sticker of happiness.Sam rocks for witty comebacks.Diana's sarcasm is brilliant.Astrid's a smartie, and...well, sometimes she leave everyone in the dust:"Let's keep moving," Sam said. "Don't worry about Little Pete. We'll find him.""Is that meant to be a pro forma reassurance or a specific commitment?" Astrid said."Sorry?"2. Writing is crispy. Yum.I like books that just gets in and say what needs to be said. CUT THE FLUFF! Gone does this really well.Although, I can argue with myself (if I'm so Gollum-ish-ly inclined) that there are too many POVs and sometimes the pace drags. It's 550-pages. That's one big book. Chopping a few of the wandering story-lines would have tightened things up.But at least there's no fluffy description or mincing words. Woot!3. And it's scary.I love a bit of YA horror. Creepy stuff? Psychotic characters? Unexplainable superpowers? Seriously warped events? Gone has it all.It. is. horrible. It dives into some seriously gory and freaky subjects. Buuut this is just the prelude. The little glimpse of things to come. YOU'VE SEEN NOTHING TILL YOU READ BOOK #6.4. Can we talk about the characters now?Gonestars some of my favouritest characters of ever. I'll only talk about a few, but trust me, the character development over the 6-books is phenomenal.SamHe's definitely my favourite. The book's mostly told from his point-of-view (POV...because that's the lazy way to write it). He's unassuming, probably introverted, calm and steady Sam. He gets seriously messed up. BUT he can shoot light out of his hands. As you do.I'm sure there's no connection to the Supernatural Sam. Although if Gone-Sam had a Supernatural-Dean...I'M JUST SAYING THINGS WOULD BE BETTER FOR HIM.Astrid &amp; Little PeteFamilies are the best! Astrid is a genius and Little Pete is her 4-year-old autistic brother. It's so adorable how Astrid will do anything for her brother, even though he hardly responds to her. I love these two! Even if Little Pete is not what he seems and Astrid is a know-it-all!Caine &amp; DianaThere are the public school kids, and then there are the rich-psycho-private-school-kids. Caine and Diana are the "bad kids". Caine is controlling (also has telekinesis powers) and Diana is Miss Manipulative. On a scale of 1 to Pure Evil, these two are dancing around an 8.DrakeBully. Creep. I hate him.QuinnHe's the most disappointing dude in the series. I think Quinn represents the majority of us. How would YOU handle your world changing into some sort of mutant sphere that you couldn't escape from, with no rules, and kids with crazy superpowers suddenly vying for world domination? You'd freak. Quinn does.He's brought into the picture as Sam's quirky and confident BFF. But as the book goes on? Quinn is a snivelling worm. It's sad, his demise, but I think very potent.The characters are ALL super dimensional, with just a few words. There were POVs I didn't really care about, but, I'm still in awe how there are SO many characters and they all have personalities with multiple layers. Talent? I think so.5. Kids are crazy. Just sayin'.YOU imagine a world without adults. With no one "running" the world. When the oldest person is 14-years-old and not even out of Middle School (or Primary School, as we say in Australia). Things ain't going to fly well. We live in a high-maintenance society and even adults have mental breakdowns trying to run the world.Imagine kids doing it.Imagine already psycho kids doing it.6. Let's just snatch up all these kids and give them a cuddle.I still like Sam's idea of "everyone just have a cookie and calm down". This kid has brains, I like him.At the end of book #1 I just want to reach in there and snatch these kids up and give them multiple pieces of pie and not let them go through the horrors and tortures that lead to book, #6:Light.But then again, out of all 6 books, I thinkLightis my favourite. We wouldn't want to miss it, now, would we?(Just...um, just don't let the Winchesters in to clean up this mess, okay?)Okay, off you pop. Go read it.If I'm going to be emotionally drained and invested in these series, then you should be too. We can be in pain together.ORIGINALLY REVIEWED IN JANUARY, 2011.Gone is a surprisingly dramatic, well written novel -- geared at upper primary and teens. It's a gripping thriller that will make you keep reading. The size is a little daunting, but worth it. The author keep several story lines going, giving each the needed attention, but without too much rambling information. You'll keep turning the pages to see what's happening to the heroes -- Sam and Astrid.The characters are realistic and relatable. You find yourself getting engaged in the plot as well as the characters lives, feelings and thoughts. The characters are rational -- and they grow as the story progresses.Some of the plot developments are a bit wild, obviously left open to be fulfilled in the sequels. Kids develop mutant powers and the depravity of man is explored. What would happen if there were no adults left? What kind of kids take charge? School bullies suddenly become much more dangerous. Kids look for someone to assure them, to tell them what's happening and what they need to do. Sam shies away from the task -- and Caine takes it. Is it worth standing up for what's right? Or is it safer to step back and let the cruel and inhumane do as they please?It's a thought provoking novel, though, not without it's wild twists and subplots that are never fully explained. Well-worth the read.
