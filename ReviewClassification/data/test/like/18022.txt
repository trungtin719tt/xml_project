I really likedGone Girl, but was quite disappointed byDark Places, so I had absolutely no idea what I would think about this book. I'm happy to report that this one was another win for me! It was a super easy and fast read with a solid plot and interesting characters.In fact, I think the main character Camille is my favorite one out of all the ones Gillian Flynn has created over the years. Some actions of hers seemed a bit too hectic (?) for me though; I couldn't understand why the author decided to write some (to the plot completely unnecessary ) scenes involving her in there. These scenes didn't really line up with the rest of her character traits. On the other hand, this also kind of fit in with Camille's overall personality. So I didn't mind this too much.However, Ididhave a bigger problem with the portrayal of her little sister Amma. I feel like she actedwayto mature for her age. Sure, some teens grow up faster than others, but she seemed a bit too "out there" for my liking. At some points I was even questioning if maybe Camille (who narrates this novel) just majorly exaggerated her behavior and that this would somehow tie into the story. Since this wasn't the case though, it's hard for me to view Amma as a realistic character. But maybe I'm just too much of a prude to believe that someone like her would actually exist...The topic that gets dealt with is very interesting, but also very heavy. Too heavy, in my opinion, to wrap up in such a short amount of pages. Some deeper explanation and exploration would have been needed for a deeper impact. Everything wrapped up a bit too easy and quickly in the end.It was still shocking and highly entertaining though, which made this a great thriller to pass some time.
