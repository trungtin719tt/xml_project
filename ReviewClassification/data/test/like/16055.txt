"Survival of the richest, the city's ours before the fallThey're Monaco and Hamptons bound, but we don't feel like outsiders at all."- Halsey, "New Americana"3.5 StarsBetter than I thought it would be, and my random book of the month, decided through a fair bit of weird numerology and enough "eeny meeny miney mo" the reference librarian probably thought I'd gone crazy.The Summary (that they don't give you):So there's this girl Schuyler (pronounced Skylar, I think) who doesn't fit in :( at her exclusive NYC private school, but after strange things start happening to her, she gets an invitation to an exclusive group of Manhattan socialites who are actually (gasp!) vampires. There are two other perspectives, Mimi Force, proud vampire, ice queen, and clique head at Schuyler's school; and Bliss, transplanted Texan and Mimi's reluctant sidekick, who is growing into being a vampire. At similar schools, emerging vampire teenagers are getting murdered, but none of the adult leaders will tell them how, because vampires are supposedly immune to everything, including stakes, crosses, and holy water. (Suspicious, right?!?)Now for the review. A fun, light read that is kind of likePretty Little Liarscrossed withCity of Bones. It's a glamour-filled book with just as much social backstabbing and fancy parties as bloodsucking, but manages to pull it off without being shallow. I gave it the extra half star, because for being what looked like another stupid chicklit, it was actually surprisingly fun. (Hence the label "fluffy fun chicklit.") It entertained with enough paranormal suspense and eye candy without transforming into a meangirl parade.Out of the 3 main characters/perspectives (3rd person btw), I liked Bliss the best. Schuyler is OK for the most part, but she was such a Mary Sue underdog- effortlessly pretty enough for a modeling shoot, outcast who scorns the blonde "Mimi clones", and bearer of vintage clothes and a weird name. Mimi's perspective is fun because she's such a classic mean girl (a laMeangirls), but she doesn't have very many notable characteristics, and has a frozen solid ice queen heart. Bliss is perhaps the most likeable, because she's not sure whether she should follow Mimi and her clique or do what she wants. Sure, this sounds a little tropey, but overall, I could empathize with her the most, and she seemed like a nice character.The romance, though, was kinda dumb. Instalurve with Mimi's twin brother Jack, whom Mimi is creepily possessive of. He was so cardboard. The whole romance pretty much mirrored that ofCity of Bones, outcast "Clary-sue" falling for perfect hot guy who is ripped and super popular, and then her BFF who wants to be more than friends, fellow geek Simon/Oliver, is kind of like, "Hi, I'm still here too..."Overall, the worldbuilding looked a lot like that of City of Bones. I'm not saying one copied the other, though since Blue Bloods was published first, it seems near impossible, but the whole fallen angel thing is like the whole Shadowhunter thing. But the whole modern world of the rich and famous was unintentionally funny for me, because since it's almost 10 years old, the pop culture references and tech made me laugh a little. Bliss "flipped open" her brand-new, top of the line phone? Ah, I remember the days of yore... I think they mentioned a few pop musicians I have never heard of, and all the characters were like, "Oh my gosh, they are so in right now!"Okay, so don't expect War and Peace, but all things considered, I had fun reading this.
