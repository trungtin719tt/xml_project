That was one of the best novels I`ve ever readHere is one of the most few fact I believe in...There`s a very tiny thin hair between every thing and it`s opposite...good &amp; evil...dark &amp; light...matter &amp; antimatter..Now...dose the scinetist have the right to creat whatever the hell he wanna creat just because he found out that he really CAN creat it?...YES...but how many leiutis that have been created along the way since the very beginning of the human history and was used the our own destruction?...Another fact we need to face...This is a cruel world we live in...And the human is a bloody cruel creature...The truth is...We need religion...Some control...Something to make us stop and think for a moment...To ask ourselves...Am I doing the right thing?...What I`m about to creat...Is it really gonna help the people?...Or it`s simply gonna make life a litte more harder?...As if it wasn`t hard enough already :)
