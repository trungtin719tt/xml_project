One thing I've noticed about Westerfeld's novels is how bittersweet the endings are. Although there is still a rainbow (or fireworks) to brighten the blow, there is still death, failure, destruction. Westerfeld knows life will never have a happy ending, just a bittersweet one.Specials is no exception. Although the novel starts off slow, it quickly builds up speed, carrying you along Tally's final journey. She's now a Cutter, a Special Circumstances pet project. Cutters are stronger -and more obnoxious- than anyone, built to bring an end to the New Smoke. Despite her new rank, though, Tally still feels amiss, and is determined to make Zane a cutter too.One of things I really enjoyed is how different Tally becomes in each book. From Ugly to Pretty to Special, her entire personality shifts and changes constantly as she undergoes not just plastic surgery, but mental surgery. It's terribly frustrating knowing she's been brainwashed, but she refuses to believe it.Perfect ending to the trilogy. Highly depressing, but enlightening also. The final chapter especially sent shivers down my spine, and made me think twice about the world we live in.And I'm still Team Zane :(
