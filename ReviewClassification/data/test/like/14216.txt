I love the world in these books. The idea of a Goddess, the elements, light and darkness. Warriors and Guardians who swear oaths to protect their Queen; it's all very cool. I liked seeing more of Stark's point of view, he cares so much for Zoey and it was amazing all that he was willing to do for her. Getting a bit of Kalona was interesting. As the bad guy, seeing into his head and how he interacted with Nyx definitely made me think and reconsider some of what I know. I do have a harder time following stories when there's a lot of points of view. There were about 7 I think and it was a bit much. Usually it's only 1 or 2 which is simpler. I am digging Stevie Rae and Rephaim's relationship and I hope that can work out. I hate Neferet and I hope she gets what's coming to her by the end of the series.
