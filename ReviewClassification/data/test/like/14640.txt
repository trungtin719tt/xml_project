Awesome!! I loved the book!! its one of the best romantic books i have ever read!! Though its a sequel to "The Notebook" , there is no compulsion that one shud that before reading this!! Frankly, i liked the sequel more than the prequel!! I am sure that people in their mid 40s wud def feel connected!!
