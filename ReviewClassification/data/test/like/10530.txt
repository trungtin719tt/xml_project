4 Stars for Ari &amp; Dante - a quick, easy read centered around the coming of age friendship of two mostly loner boys. Yet, it's also the kid of story you'll want to savor slowly.I enjoyed Ari &amp; Dante and their friendship. I allowed myself to become a third wheel of sorts as they forged the bonds of their friendship. Dante was so sweet, loving and honest (he was my favorite character hands down!). Ari always so angry and confused yet loyal and deep in his own way was a bit more complex. It was easy to see how they balanced and complimented each other.Saenz effortlessly brings us into their world, allowing the reader to witness their friendship grow, unfold &amp; change over time.One of my favorite things about the book was the boys' parents - I LOVED how honest and supportive they were. It was interesting to see how in touch they were with the boys, how invested they were in them and how much genuine love there was between everyone. It warmed my heart to see such strong, accepting family relationships.This is definitely one of those books filled with characters that will remain nestled in my heart for a long time to come.
