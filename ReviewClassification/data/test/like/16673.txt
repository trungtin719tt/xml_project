Wow.. Just wow.I really didn't know I could cry this much!! And its not even my life!!They are happy and I am crying. They are sad and again I cry. They are laughing and I am crying. They are crying and I am crying.I read slammed and I thought I wouldn't read this book for a few days. But I missed Will :( I started reading in the night and I could'nt put my book down!!I was awake whole night crying,laughing and experienced so many emotions at the same time...!I loved the new characters. They didnt feel like new...I still cant understand why I cant find a wiki page and why is this book rated 4.42 only. Really funny world.This book thought me a lot... I am not good at writing reviews unlike many people here...But as the book I had to write my thoughts.. Just put it out there!!I miss the book already and I really wanna read more about them!1But when I think abt it.. I better dont.I mean if one more book is out that means Lake and Will are gonna suffer more... I think they suffered enough already. :PI know it sounds butterflying stupid.. But I think they deserve a happily ever after...I just loved the idea of a small family.. Will,Lake, their brothers,Eddie and Gavin... Its perfect!I loved the book.. Just loved it. Everything.. From the advices and poems.. to the knock on the doors... Everything.I just love you Colleen. U have given me so much to think about. Thank you.And for those who gave this book less than 5 stars... Butterfly off.
