If you couldn't already tell, I'm infatuated with this series. Not only will I re-read all the books over and over again, but Barrons has taken top spot as the literary man of my dreams (sorry Atticus Finch) - and I still have one book to go, which I am not ready for because good things can't and shouldn't end.Dreamfever is, for lack of better words, fucking AWESOME. Stuff finally happens. Questions are finally answered. Mac is the fiery and fierce heroine I've come to lurve and Barrons just does things to my low region that makes me go woah hey what WHAT IS THIS. Nice.I have a love/hate relationship with KMM. Just when you think you're going to find something out, she revokes that privilege. She makes you work for your answers till the very last page, and you still end up with a steaming mug of WTF. But I forgive because she gives you a naked Barrons. Yaaaaaaas."You are the most beautiful man I have ever seen," I tell him. "You are perfect."AH.Excuse me while I play Tubthumping and re-read chapter four because I do what I want when I want.
