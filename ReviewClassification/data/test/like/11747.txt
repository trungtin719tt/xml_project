Uniquely written, deeply satisfying as well as profoundly alarming, Jitterbug Perfume has it all. As a lover of Tom Robbins' writing style, his flexible plot lines, and the unique way he portrays his characters, I consider this his Magnum Opus. The clever, captivating, and quite often smug prose is the only right tone for these profound characters to evolve, and the carefully-crafted complex setting compliments a plot full of excitement. A Must-Read for sure.
