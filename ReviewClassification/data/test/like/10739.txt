The wonderfully talented Laura Hillenbrand makes history come alive in this page turning account of the life and times of one of thoroughbreds greatest 4 legged athletes. After setting the depression era stage, the author examines the back-stories of Seabiscuit's charismatic owners; Charles and Marcella Howard, the enigmatic and gifted trainer Tom Smith, the very talented but hard luck jockey, Red Pollard and of course the protagonist, Seabiscuit. Where I might differ in the universally effusive praise of this fine book, concerns what I thought was overkill on the details of each race, especially the 1938 match race against the Eastern thoroughbred champion, War Admiral. Every conceivable detail was researched and covered in chapter sized length in the authors account of the events surrounding this monumental race and it was truly fascinating - up to a point. By that I mean, I've always like James Bond movies and have seen them all numerous times over the years. A new Daniel Craig/ Bond movie will be released this fall and I'll see it the first week because what's important to me is the finished product, not the myriad details of how the movie was made. As an old History major I've always thought it more important to write readable history than to get caught up in the weeds trying to use use every factoid one's research uncovers but hey, that just me.
