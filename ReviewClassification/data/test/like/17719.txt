Like Fantasy Fiction, perhaps Science Fiction? If so, you have chosen wisely. This takes the two great genres, I happen to be passionate about both genres which this story combines into what would result in perfect meat and veggie stew combination. Fast-paced action riddled throughout, and a truly likable cast of characters set in the sights of an eternal evil poised to return to the planet earth. Yeah, it has space travel. Written in a manner that keeps the pages turning with an understanding like novels before. The reader will want more, so please write another. To the author Suzanne Boisvert, From your readers.
