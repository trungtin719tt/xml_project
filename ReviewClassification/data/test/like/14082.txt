I reread this one via an audio book.After 3 years I decided to listen to this one and I have three words for the second time-&gt; I LOVED IT!11/14/2015LOVED ITYou know it's good when you can't put it down and you stay up reading until you fall asleep with the book in your hands. Then you wake up extra early so you can finish the last couple of pages you couldn't keep your eyes open any longer before you zonked out.After I finished I had to go back and read the section(view spoiler)[ where she first sees his garage and feels like she knows that place. Through out the whole story that stuck in my mind as what didthat even mean(hide spoiler)]. Until the last sentence of the book pulled it all together.I spent the a lot of the book noticing when she(view spoiler)[ starts to refer to Josh's home as "home." And then the line at the end where she says, "And after five weeks I go home. "(hide spoiler)]wow.The writing is so superb and witty. The author captures your heart in her hands and holds it though out the whole story. I got to a point where I was like Josh(view spoiler)[ in the fact that I didn't need to know Sunshine's secret. I just wanted her to be okay and if not knowing makes her okay then I was fine with that.(hide spoiler)]I just finished but I want to reread it already to capture the stuff I'm sure I missed the first time. It's that good!!!I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE WHOLE BOOK.
