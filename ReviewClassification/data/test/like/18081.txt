MY VIDEO REVIEW IS NOW LIVE:https://youtu.be/ehlUs9b3JZsThat was INCREDIBLE!I don't have the words to describe how absolutely perfect this is. Hands down the best book I've read this year and one of the best books I've EVER read.I loved the first book, but Crooked Kingdom took the bones of Six of Crows and gave them life. Not only is it the perfect sequel in terms of expanding the world and further developing the themes and characters, but it can absolutely stand alone as it's own story.This series has just about everything I could ever want: an intricately developed fantasy world with well rounded and diverse characters, complex romantic and platonic relationships, social commentary on humanity and society, and meaningful messages about love, family, and morality, all wrapped up in a beautifully written and compelling plot.There were so many moments throughout this book where I started crying because of how much some of the themes and characters resonated with me. I can't even begin to express how happy I am that this book exists.Nothing has ever rivaled my love for The Night Circus, but Crooked Kingdom might just top it.Full video review to come!
