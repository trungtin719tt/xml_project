This is a cozy, delightful retelling ofThe Beauty and the Beasttale, one of my very favorite fairy tale retellings.Final review:I've just readBeautyagain for the first time in 15 years or more, but I probably read this 5 or 6 times when I was in my 20s, so you arenotgetting an unbiased opinion here. But I still adore this book, even though I'm older and more cynical now. It's a fairly simple, straightforward retelling of the fairy tale, with a few relatively minor twists. But the writing is lovely, the characters charming, and McKinley used a very fairy tale-ish style of writing that fits the story well. The ending is a little rushed, but otherwise I have no complaints. I want to be Beauty's bestie and chat books and eat buttered toast with her and help her braid Greatheart's mane.Beautykeeps all 5 stars. Call it nostalgia, but I'm not even a little bit sorry!10/14/15:Buddy read with Jessica and Robin! The big question for me: will I still love it as much as I did when I was in my early 20s? Stay tuned.Initial review:Beautyhas been for a long time one of my favorite fairy tale novelizations. It's a delightful read, not as long or complex as some of Robin McKinley's later works, but it has sweetness and a heart and has withstood many re-readings. I remain convinced that Disney swiped several details of this book for its "Beauty and the Beast," like the book-loving heroine:and the servants that seem to have become part of the furniture:It's been at least 10 or 15 years since I read this and I probably should do a re-read one of these days to see if it's really a 5-star book or if it's just an excess of nostalgia for an old favorite that's driving my high rating. Till then, just don't go into this expecting something really deep or earth-shaking; it's more of a lovely, sweet, gentle comfort read.
