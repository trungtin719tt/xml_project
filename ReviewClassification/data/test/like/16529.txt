This buddy-read has been long- Some of our ka-tet have fallen...some have been left behind in the dust. We have picked up a few new members along the way- but only the strongest and most cunning will survive the whole journey to The Daaaaark Tooooooower.Buddy-read with our fearless leader-Quick Draw Stepheny,Jumpin' Jeff,Calamity Bev, Welcome-Kid Colt Karly, andDastardly Dan...and let us have a moment of silence for our fallen members-Bronco Bustin' Black Jackin' Jason- Jason's perverted name will be missed- as will Jason...and who knows maybe a year from now he will get past page 43. One can only hope. May luck be with you, my friend. Also missing in action- is the cute as a buttonBloody Black Kit Kat- We lost Kat to.....THE MANGAAAA....Da da Daaaaaaaaaaa *key scary music*...and last but not leastShotgun Slingin' Steven- Steven was last seen fighting with a succubus in The Wastelands- This was a battle he unfortunately lost. Sorry Steven- We tried to save you...really we did.WIZARD AND GLASS- book # four in the series- begins exactly where The Waste Lands leaves off...Roland, Eddie, Susannah, Jake "Ake", and Oy: are riddling with Blaine the Mono. After dealing with Blaine the Pain- the ka-tet ends up in Topeka, Kansas...where they are rewarded with Roland's story. The story of his past...The story of what made Roland...Roland.His original ka-tet- Cuthbert Allgood and Alain Johns......his battles with baddies- Rhea of the Coos and The Big Coffin Hunters......and the love of his life- Susan Delgado.This one is for the laaaaaaaaaaaaadies. Or men with curiosity and romance in their hearts- because over 1/2 of WIZARD AND GLASS is the love story between Roland and Susan and how Roland came to be the heart-broken, distant, cold- man we see before us. Some people don't want to know what made their hero that way...some like these things to remain a mystery. I am not one of those people- I like things explained, and I don't mind my heroes vulnerable and human.WIZARD AND GLASS is my favorite of the series so far! I am sooooooo looking forward to the next buddy-read. Let the journey continue!!
