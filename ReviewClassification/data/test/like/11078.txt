Mac Version 1.0The book starts off in Georgia. Mac is a pretty pampered. She works as a bartender, doesn't have much ambition..Just is.No, not Arby's..she is a bartender! Who happens to love pink..way too much.She is lying by the pool waiting on her parents to come home and spoil her some more when her world cracks. She gets the call that her adored sister Alina has been murdered in Dublin. She hops a plane and heads to Ireland because the police have given up on finding her killers and she is the angry sister that will spur them on.Once there she runs into a bookstore..that happens to be owned by Jerrico fucking Barrons.Barrons is pretty much an ass..but he is hawt so that kinda is overlooked..yes even by my hating ass.After Mac realizes she can see the Fae she is informed they might not like that and will kill her Barbie butt. So Barron takes her in and together they start hunting Fae objects plus the book that her sister died trying to locate.Once it's realized that the fae know that Mac can see them she is forced to change her appearance.I haven't read much UF..and I admit..I liked this book quite a bit. It's pure fun. A perfect escape when you need it. I will continue with the series that my GR friends pushed me into.Plus I'm ready for another version of Mac.......
