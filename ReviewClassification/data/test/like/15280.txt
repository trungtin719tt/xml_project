This was a book that was one of my very favorites growing up, but I haven't read it since probably junior high. While discussing a different book with friends, this title came up. So, I decided to rumage through all of my boxes of old books, find this one and dust it off and give it a good read. It was just as fun as I remembered it!This book is just a version of the widely known Beauty and the Beast fairy tale. It is a very simple, sweet and enchanting version. Beauty and the Beast has always been my favorite fairy tale, and this is probably my favorite version of it.For adults that like to read YA fiction, don't expect anything deep or truly thought provoking in this. Just expect a fun couple of hours that reminds you of being a little kid that still believed in a perfect happily ever after.If you know any 8-12 year old girls that enjoy reading, give them this book. They will love it, and it will probably start (or continue) them down the road to being a hopeless romantic.
