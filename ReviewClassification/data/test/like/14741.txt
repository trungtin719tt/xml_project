Question: Why have I never read Dennis Lehane before? No idea, but it is a situation that I will endeavor to rectify as quickly as possible.This book is one that will most absolutely stick in my head for a long time to come. I loved it, from start to finish. I love the unexpectedness of it, and how I was so wrapped up in the story at times that I had to literally drag myself away, and how toward the end, I was so anxious about what would happen that I was afraid to pick it up again. These are the stories that I love. I will definitely be reading more Lehane. Abso-freakin'-lutely.I don't want to give too much away about this story, but I will say that there are a few specific things that I loved about it. Here they are in no particular order:First, Teddy and Chuck's interplay. I enjoyed the way that they talked to each other and got along and joked, how they found common ground in discussing WWII. The way that they immediately settled into their roles and partnership. I found their interaction to be real and honest, and surprisingly funny at times.Next, the real but surreal, lucid but dreamlike escalation of every page. The shiftiness... the "is this real?" factor. This book... just messed with my head. I didn't know what to expect. The simple way that Lehane wrote made everything seem tangible and real. I loved that. I loved the way it made me feel.Teddy... Type A, alpha male, always in control, badass, but mourning his dead wife in a way that breaks your heart. What's not to love?Lehane also has a way with words... There were a lot of quotes from this book that left me thinking "Damn... why has this never been described that way before??" Not anything beautiful or poetic or anything, just refreshing and honest. Like the way that he describes the ocean as"older than the gods and prouder of its body count". Or the quote about waking,"...waking, after all, was an almost natal state. You surfaced without a history, then spent the blinks and yawns reassembling your past, shuffling the shards into chronological order before fortifying yourself for the present."I never saw the ending coming, and I am always thrilled when that happens. I hate being able to guess where a story is going. But this one definitely satisfied, and I have a feeling that I will be creating a Dennis Lehane shelf quite soon. :)Read this book.
