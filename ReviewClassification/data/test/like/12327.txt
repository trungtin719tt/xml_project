This is easily one of my favorite novels of the books I've read in the past 5 years. It's lauded as Stegner's masterpiece and I completely agree.Stegner tells the story of a man who has a disease that is crippling him. He's living in his ancestral home, being taken care of by an old, old, family friend. He's a historian and feels compelled to research his paternal grandmother using the journals and keepsakes that are at the house. Stegner weaves the life story of the grandmother (and grandfather) and the story of the historian together. As the protagonist is making realizations and grudgingly realizing the two may be compared--the reader is also--and making his/her revelations about the story. What unfolds is a breathtaking piece about marital/familial relationships. A novel that will suck you in, you'll almost smell the rooms, imagine the places that the novel took place in.
