I loved this book (the whole series actually). I would hate to have necromancy as my superpower, but Chloe handles it great - well, most of the time. She was just idiotic when there was a ghost or dead body nearby and decided to "stick it out". But I loved her and derek's relationship. He was supposed to be the "jerk" but I never really saw him that way - even in the beginning. I guess he just wasnt the typical friendly, cute, Im gonna chase after this girl until she finally gives in and says yes kinda guy. I like how neither of them want to admit they like each other until the 3rd book - derek even getting mad cuz simon likes her and he wants him to be happy. I feel like they could have kept going with the story - well, or could have expanded on it a little more. I still dont really know what the "cabals" are , they were just mentioned here and there.. or what happened with the half - demon lady? I thought she might pop up again later.. but I guess they just needed an out for the character without having her turn on the kids? Idk. I really loved all the characters though, and the story was great. I especially liked how Chloe was a great main female character, just the right mix of not being the damsel in distress cant do anything for herself, but not throwing herself in the line of danger all the time and thinking shes invincible and being the damsel in distress anyway.
