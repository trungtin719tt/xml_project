If you thought"The Notebook"was a tearjerker, then get ready to have a hanky on hand and be on an emotional rollercoaster ride with Sparks's second star-crossed love story,"Message in a Bottle".When Theresa Osborne takes a much-needed summer holiday at Cape Cod, she finds a lot more than a break from the hustle and bustle. On an early-morning jog along Cape Cod Bay, she comes across a corked bottle with a scrolled-up message inside that reads,"My Dearest Catherine, I miss you."Subsequent publication of the poignant missive in her column turns up two more letters, found by others, from the same mysterious writer, Garrett Blake.Piqued, Theresa follows the trail to North Carolina, where she discovers that Garrett has been mourning his late wife for three years; writing the sea-borne messages is his only solace. Theresa also finds that Garrett just might be ready to love again and that she might be the woman for him. There are few surprises here as we watch the couple learn to love in Catherine's slowly waning shadow."Someday you'll find someone special again. People who've been in love once usually do. It's in their nature."The struggle Garrett has to forget his past and look at the future allows many readers to relate to Garrett. The fact that Garrett conquers himself may give people hope to win their own battles."Do you really think it's possible if we don't see each other very much? When would I get to hold you? When would I be able to see your face? If we only see each other once in a while, we won't be able to do the things that we need to... to continue feeling the way we do. Every time we saw each other, we'd know it's only for a couple of days. There wouldn't be time for anything to grow."The story relates to the inner romantic in us--whether you choose to admit it or not. It's a real tearjerker--you can't help but wish you'd also be swept up in a love like this. On the whole, it's a compassionate story of a person looking for love, meeting a person who never thought he would find love again. The relationship between Theresa and Garrett is natural and relatable; just get ready for the tears to flow when you read the ending.Book Details:TitleMessage in a BottleAuthorNicholas SparksReviewed ByPurplycookie
