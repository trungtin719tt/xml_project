The Well of Ascensionwas a beautiful follow-up toThe Final Empire. There's so much going on now that it's difficult to speak on a lot of the specifics, so my review will focus on moregeneral overviewof what I enjoyed and what I didn't.Plot:The plot wasby farthe strongest point of the novel. I was just so engrossed in all of the political conversations happening here. I like my high fantasy heavy on the political intrigue with dashes of cunning &amp; betrayal.Plus the last little bit of this story justblew my fucking mind.Sanderson has no mercy when it comes to plot twists. He'll drag you through the ashes of your favorite characters. He'll throw you out of the airplane and shout"Plot twist! I cut holes in your parachute, bitch!"It was crazy! But I enjoyed every minute of this plot as it unfolded.Character Development:I feel as though Vin is the only character that really grew at all in this novel.There is an argument to be made for both Sazed and Elend, as they do make some strides forward, but most of the development primarily revolved around Vin. For me, I wanted alittle morein this area. I feel like everyone else was static and that didn't really do much for my reading experience.I'm very glad though for all that Vin underwent in this novel because I really wasn't that fond of her inThe Final Empire, and so this really helped me sympathize with and understand her as an individual.Pace:The pace was just alittlebit slow in some places for me. As you may or may not know, I'm not normally very bothered by a slow pace. Like we have to be almost moving backwards before I notice anything is amiss.However, there were just a few parts here that dragged a bit longer than I found necessary. Overall though, I didn't much mind the pace. It's methodical, it's well done, and most of the information presented here is necessary.I'm very excited to start the final book in this trilogy. The last section of this novel has me very anxious to find out how this will all end!Buddy read this withsweet Aria,Tweebsiepoo, &amp;my bby Pragya.*UPDATE: Spoilers in my comments section for The Final Empire!
