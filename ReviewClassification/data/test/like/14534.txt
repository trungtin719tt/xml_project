It took me a while to start writing this, you know.I needed time; not only to decide how to talk about this book, but IF I wanted to talk about it , in the first place. In fact I'm not sure whether I should recommend it, despite the fact that I absolutely loved it.As a literary work, it's a masterpiece - H. Selby is one of the most talented writers I've ever come across. From the emotional point of view though, oh God, this book is just devastating, as only his books can be. If you choose to read it, beware: you'll pay dearly for your decision.Selby is a monstrous crossing between a sadistic shrink and a blood-thirsty confessor: a cruel, merciless moralist who wants you to shed all your tears right in front of him and then look at yourself in the mirror... if you still dare look at yourself, that is.I knew what to expect from this novel; I'm familiar enough with some of the author's previous work, so I was prepared to go through something I wouldn't easily forget. What I couldn't imagine was the intensity of that feeling. I seldom find myself utterly speechless after reading a book, but it did happen this time. I put it down and just didn't know what to say.Luckily enough, the title says everything: "Requiem"... the eternal rest. Such a nice euphemism for death.The core of this heartbreaking tale is indeed death: the death of hope, the moment dreams turn into nightmares - and we realise that we can't wake up anymore.New York, late seventies. Four people: Harry, a Jewish working-class guy in his twenties, keen on heroin and hanging out with his buddies ; his girlfriend Marion, an educated young artist painfully hostile to her Jewish upper-class family and its repressive hypocrisy, a frustrated individual with a penchant for drugs and intellectualism; Tyrone, their black friend raised in the seedy streets of Harlem; and Sara, Harry's mother - a lonely widow addicted to tv commercials, Jewish delicatessen and cream-filled chocolates.What is it that keeps such people alive?What's the reason for them to make it through day after day of emptiness, stuck as they are in the roles life seems to have chosen for them once and for all - the lazy no-good, the girl haunted by insecurity and wasted potential, the black youth doomed by the hopelessness of his very origins, and the sad woman aging in an old flat and talking to her fridge, unable to discern between her favourite tv shows and the troubles of real life (until her son steals her tv set in order to get money for junk, that is).The reason that keeps them alive is: they're waiting for a chance. Waiting for a reason to exist, waiting for a dream. When that chance suddenly materialises, their dreams blossom like wild flowers warmed by the brightest sun, the sun of hope. But wild flowers are doomed to wither and get burnt by that very same warmth they crave for.When the guys come across some very good - and inexplicably uncut - bags of junk, they realise this could be the beginning of a new life for them all, and start forming a plan. Their intention is to buy a large amount of pure heroin, cut it four of five times, sell it in the streets and make lots of money; simple as that.The thing is that it's not money what they aim to, not at all: money will only be a means for their dreams to come true. Harry and Marion will open a coffee shop, a cool place for artists and intellectuals, travel all around the world and be happy together; Tyrone will finally live a peaceful life in the suburbs, far from the violence and ugliness of the ghetto, and give his girlfriend a family.And Sara? What about Sara?Well, one fine day she answers the phone and someone tells her she's been chosen to take part in a tv show... as a contestant. We'll let you know all the details, Mrs Golfarb... congratulations!Dreams can save us from ourselves, that's a matter of fact. Either we call them hope, faith, fantasy, they do save us from our failures and fears and insecurities and give us the strenght to go on day after day.Dreams are dangerous, though. They can be the worst sort of trap, the trap we build with our own hands. When they become our only reason to exist - and maybe our only chance to - they take possession of our whole being and become an addiction. This is indeed the subject of this book: addiction. To drugs, food, tv, but most of all to dreams. Whatever it is our addiction, it works its way through our heart and mind, and doesn't stop until it's finished with us.How are three heroin addicts supposed to deal with a huge amount of junk and money without screwing everything up?How is a simple-minded, almost illiterate woman supposed to starve and take diet pills (actually amphetamines) for months in order to wear a fifteen-year-old dress and look gorgeous on tv without going nuts?The answer is easy, isn't it? They. Can't. Make. It.We know from the beginning something bad is going to happen, it can't be otherwise. The thing is that these people drag us down with them, page after page, in a claustrophobic downward spiral that seems to be bottomless. I thought Irvine Welsh did a good job in "Trainspotting" (yes, yes, okay, the toilet scene is great) but it doesn't remotely compare to this descent to hell. Selby spares nothing to his reader: prostitution, needle tracks on filthy legs and necks, gangrenous arms, the sufferings of withdrawal and betrayal, rundown buildings in which junkies get their fix surrounded by rats and corpses of overdosed youths; and, on the other side, Sara's starvation, her drug-induced mental issues, her total alienation.But this is just the beginning. We just can't imagine what awaits them - us! - in the end, and the horrors we are to witness all along.One must keep in mind that by 1979, when this novel is first published, Selby is quite familiar with heroin; he knows what he writes about, since he has been dealing with his own habit for more than a decade. When he describes the way junk affects one's body, mind and soul, well, he's not making it up.What strikes me the most is how merciless he is in punishing is characters. It's not even a punishment really: it's a journey toward the ultimate catharsis. His characters, as in "Last Exit to Brooklyn" (his first novel and literary case) have no choice: they can only die or be born again. No other option, no second chance will be allowed to them... either they 'see the light' or get devoured by their own darkness.They don't die, though. They aren't lucky enough.Paradoxical as it might sound, there's a religious intensity in Selby's novels that can't be ignored or dismissed as a mannerism, especially in this one. The biblical quotes in the opening are not merely a literary choice, they summarise the message of his work and his personal commitment to the subject. He's not only going to tell us a tale: he wants us to know from the very beginning there will be a price to pay.I don't even know what to think of this book. It was a sad, terrifying, disgusting, sometimes hilarious (Sara's dialogues with the fridge, the sitcom-style scenes with her neighbours) and often unbearable journey, leading to an ending that turned me to stone. I'm glad not to be a mother, because I would be looking at my sons in a strange way now.But I love it when it happens. I mean, I love it when I find myself totally bewildered, frightened, unable to gather my thoughts, because it means I still don't need to shoot junk in order to bear my own existence, I still don't need to be hypnotised by television to forget my problems, I still don't need to forget who I am and live in a fantasy world. It means that I'm still able to enjoy my own emotions and feelings. It means that I'm still alive.This book will stay with me, that's for sure. It will stay with me for a very long time and I will cherish all the horrible things it forced me to face.Now you know. Don't say I didn't warn you.(A film was made out of Selby's novel: a decent job directed by D. Aronofsky, starring Jennifer Connelly, Jared Leto, Marlon Wayans and Ellen Burstyn. Same title.)
