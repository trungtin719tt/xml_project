Sometimes when people keep recommending a book, you should listen and read that book. The Forgotten Garden is such a book. You finally read it and end up wondering why in the world you waited so long. Kate Morton provides the intricate layering of different times and places in a masterful manner, gifting the reader with a story that captures the imagination and heart completely. Nell, as the lost child, is the pivotal character around which all mysteries and actions revolve. A tale that begins in England and travels across the many miles to Australia, comes home again to England to undo over a hundred years of secrets. Like the entwining vines of the garden, the story twists and turns, making the path seem impassable, but tenacity is rewarded with clarity.
