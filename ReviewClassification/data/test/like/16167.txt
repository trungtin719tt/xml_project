I admit that I have about 10 books going right now. Hurricane Harvey has thrown me off my groove. I have attempted to start books and then set them down to deal with shitty reality for a while, and then not gotten back to them. But, I picked this one up and devoured it. It was so compelling to me.Of course, I love dystopia. I want the future to be seriously fucked-up. I want people to be eating weird pellets that are probably made out of people, an evil overlord with some sort of hatred of children for some reason, flying cars and everything robotic - but evil robots - not good ones, an unfair class system that holds the plebs down, a scrappy resistance with a sexy (although dirty) leader, lots of senseless killing and violence, and of course - death games. This book was about the death games.Okay, maybe some of those ideas aren't exactly fresh.So, this is set in the 1970's maybe, but an alternate reality, I guess, because I don't remember there being a gameshow/competition where 100 teenage boys walked day and night until only one was left alive. I may have just been born, but I'm pretty sure I would have heard about it.The deal is that they have to keep a continuous pace of 4mph. If they slow down or stop, they are given three warnings. If they still can't keep up, they are shot in the head. Now, I just want to say that someone would absolutely have to threaten to shoot me in the head before you get my ass out there doing a fast-walk for miles and miles. Ah, who am I kidding, I would be the first one shot. And, I wouldn't even mind. Beats walking like a chump.So, all of these boys, who are definitely chumps, are walking day and night and getting all weird. Of course it messes with their minds a bit. They make little friendships, examine their life choices, and prepare to die. Seriously, how bad are your life choices when you sign up for this deal?? It's not like the Hunger Games where they have no choice. These chumps not only signed up for this shit, but they had to pass mental and physical tests to do it. Youth these days. So stupid. I meanthosedays. So stupid. One chump even tells his story about how he entered on a dare/whim/lark and it went too far. Dude!!!Peer pressure. Not even once.The rest of them are suicidal for some reason. Oh, maybe it's because they are teenagers living in an oppressive dystopian world. I mean, depressing teenagers is pretty damn easy on a good day.Holy shit! Where can I purchase this horse? He's glorious!The book is not filled with action and adventure, although there is killing. It is more of the inner struggle of the characters. I could talk about how it's possible to see some symbolism in the walk as being a journey in life with the general being an all-powerful being who is promising the person who makes it to the end the prize of anything their heart desires. It is also the ultimate in the carrot and stick analogy , but I'm not that deep. I just liked that a bunch of stupid chumps learned that you should never sign up for anything that has the promise of untold riches. It's always a sucker deal. Unlike what I've got going on. There is a Nigerian prince who wants me to distribute millions of dollars in any way I want, including keeping it for myself. All I need to do is send him my banking information and those millions are on their way.Oh, and forget the horse. I want one of these guys. Look at those smiles! Only good things can come from me owning an alpaca in my suburban home. They swim, right?
