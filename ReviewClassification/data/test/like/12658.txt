This book reached me on many levels and gave me a lot to think about. Here are a few of them:1. As parents, we push our children to do well in school, some of us want our kids to excel in sports, others want their kids to be leaders and to have a lot of friends and to be popular. Here we have a prodigy son who at a young age is a Mozart of art, and yet because of his parent's religious background and beliefs, he is made to believe his gift is bad and useless and that he should conform to their narrow and religious beliefs and forget about the gift. And yet a loving mother and a wise leader give him just enough space that he is able to become a master at a young age. It is painful that the parents are never able to understand the world of art and their son's gift. There seemed to be two statements to me here: Don't be this kind of myopic and selfish parent and make sure you understand your child's talents and needs. Quit trying so hard to mold him into a mini version of yourself. Luckily, Asher's mother was more understanding a loving than his father.2. It seems like there was a lot to say about the whole mission of this particular branch of the Jewish Religion. In today's world as we hear about the extremists of each of the branches of various religions, there's not much to like. Extreme Muslims, Jews, Mormons, Catholics, Buddhists and others are remarkably similar in their lack of tolerance for behavior outside of their prescribed narrow box. The book does an excellent job of showing how religious beliefs are forced into the children. Asher is one of the few who is able to fight that pressure at a very young age.3. Throughout the book, the art of art is described very well and in great detail. Anyone interested at all in the world of art will enjoy the evolution of the child prodigy into a budding successful artist and the influence of his outstanding and likable teacher.4. I was disappointed that Asher didn't have any friends except for older mentors. No girlfriends or buddies. I don't believe that this is the case with most hugely talented artists, but perhaps in part, it is because of his Jewish religion and his strict way of life.These are merely some of the main topics that I could think of quickly. The book is full of many metaphors and excellent psychology. The relationship Asher has with each of the adults in the book is very realistically described. It almost seems that it must be autobiographical.
