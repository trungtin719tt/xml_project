Arguably the finest book I have ever read.Llewellyn's novel of a young boy growing up in Welsh coal mining country at the turn of the 20th Century is so realistic it was believed for years to be autobiographical, a myth Llewellyn himself did not discourage.The prose is so lyrical I found myself reading it aloud to my dogs, who are used to my declamations, often in dialect. Fortunately, I do not do Welsh, so they only had to hear me speak Educated North American.If you have not read this treasure, do so with all haste.
