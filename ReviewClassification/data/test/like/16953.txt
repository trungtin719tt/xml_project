It's like how my mom still calls me if there is bad weather nearby, or if I'm out driving on a holiday where the roads could be filled with people who had too much to drink.It's like when the grocery store parking lots stay full when snow is on the way because people think they may be stuck inside their house forever.It's like how the news can report on how Coke can kill you so you start drinking Diet Coke, but then the artificial sweetener can give you cancer so you try to just drink water, but there could be bacteria in it unless you use a filter.I loved this book.It took me a long time to read it, not because I didn't like it, but because I wanted to savor it, take my time with it, underline quotes, let the dialogue marinate a little bit.So, I should tell you that you can't go into the book looking for a thriller or an apocalyptic dystopian novel. The plot isn't going to suck you in and keep you turning the pages to find out what happens next. It's the conversations between the characters, the wonderful way the sentences are structured, the jump from one scene to another, the commentary behind it all. That's what you're getting into.The book hits on death, the media, fear, consumerism, and more. It was written a little while ago, but it didn't seem all that dated to me. From the first few pages I knew I had stumbled upon something special. Halfway through I was ready to tell the world to read it.At the end, I put the book down on my lap, put my hands up to the sides of my head, fingertips pressed gently into my hair, then pulled my hands away while making the sound of an explosion quietly with my lips.My mind was blown.
