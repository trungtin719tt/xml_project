Her words are eloquent and timeless.I remember reading a kids' biography of Helen by Margaret Davidson multiple times over when I was younger (alongside a similar biography of MLK Jr) and certain parts of this brought back elements from that book that I'd completely forgotten. Most people know of Helen because of The Miracle Worker, but it's so important to remember that her story didn't end by the water pump when she was a child; that was when her world was truly reopened.
