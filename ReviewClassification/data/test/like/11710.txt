I don't want it to end! :( There's still much life for these characters to lead and I want to be there for it! Although I guess it has to end somewhere...The BEAUTIFUL NATURAL WORLD she gives - my kingdom to know so much and be so deeply involved in the real world around me. (This week, I met the wooly bear caterpillar and the granite spiny lizard at Mission Trails, both locals. I can't wait to meet more and learn about more. Thank goodness for parks and rangers - at least SOMEONE is maintaining this knowledge!)Her writing is nice - she is especially beautiful describing plants and animals, and has a storyteller's voice for introducing them to humans. Her scenes are long and involved - no quick hits to make a point but no excess either. The pace matches the story. It takes TIME to know the world and is not something you learn in soundbites.I want to live there. I want to be these characters and have their problems and flaws. My heart aches. Unreservedly 5 stars.
