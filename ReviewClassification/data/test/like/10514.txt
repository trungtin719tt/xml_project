I love this classic collection of Greek, Roman, and Norse mythology. It has many negatives, but I still have an affection for it because I read it during a formative period in my life. I find it relatively readable -- not true of most mythology guides written for adults.Hamilton does a certain amount of commenting on the major sources from which she draws the myths. Therefore it's a great way to follow threads back through the actual sources; many other mythological guides don't reference their sources well. At some points, though, the reasons that stories conflict with stories I've read elsewhere simply aren't that clear. Another minor gripe is that the section on Norse Mythology feels less alive and exciting to me than the section on Greek; I believe that some of this simply comes from the fact that the sources for Norse mythology are thinner, so I have this problem with almost all Norse and Germanic mythology guides that don't just flat-out make stuff up. Hamilton does a good job with the material available in 1942, when this book was published.Despite my minor gripes, it's one of my favorite books. It's a great place to start and a fantastically enjoyable source for both the most popular myths and some more obscure ones.Interestingly, Edith Hamilton was 62 years old when her first book, The Greek Way, was published, in 1930. Mythology was published 12 years later, in 1942.
