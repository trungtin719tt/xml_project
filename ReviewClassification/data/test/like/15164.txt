5 All Together Dead StarsWell, well Sookie gets herself into some pretty crazy predicaments.I have to say I really liked the Vampire Summit, and how Sookie helps and gets put into some danger.Quinn the shifter is yummy and I liked that he seems to really be in lust with her and she with him.Andddd then poof Erik comes into play and they end up getting closer than they were.Sookie is starting to hear Vampire brains and that can be verrry dangerous for her if anyone finds out.Although I love Sookie with Quinn.. I have my heart set that she will end up with Erik.On to another book :)*You don't have to like my review but its 100% my opinion, and I am allowed to have it.*
