Prior to reading Beach Music, I had only experienced Conroy in his reading memoir,My Reading Life. Since I knew he would be at theSC Book Festival, I spent most of my reading time this past week coming back to this book. I had started it on a beach trip with my sister over spring break, but some of the topics were a little too close to me at that time.Jack, the main character in this novel, has lived in Rome with his daughter Leah ever since his wife Shyla committed suicide and he had a very close custody battle with Leah's grandparents. He is summoned home to Charleston because his mother has cancer, and the rest of the almost 800 pages go forwards and backwards in time, filling in all the pieces of the story he knows and some he doesn't know.The parts seem disconnected at first, ranging from the Holocaust to Vietnam to a time at sea with a sting ray, but they all branch out from the central story in some way. One of the more active parts of the story have to do with his childhood friend Jordan, who everyone thought had died, and that helps to bridge the gaps between some of the others.Pat Conroy is hard to fully comprehend for me. I have heard he has very similar themes in all his fiction - the dysfunctional family, the mental illness, the Holocaust and Vietnam, the landscape of the low country, the abusive father (and in this bookeveryonehas an abusive father!) - but after seeing him speak and seeing him interact with his brothers and one of his sisters yesterday at the SC Book Festival, I don't really blame him. It is clear that his family history permeates every moment, and his family is important to him.There is a sense of shocking reality to some of his writing, but then he will write these scenes of sheer unbelievability - dancing with his future wife as the ocean washes a house out to sea, a sea creature dragging the boat away, the magical rescue of the turtles - his writing is very poetic in these sections but it grated against the surrounding story to me. I wish he'd separated out his good ideas into 3 solid novels - one about the man going home after his wife's suicide, one about the boy thought dead, and one that had the more magical elements. It had the feeling of a forced epic, when the strength comes in the smaller elements - the conflicts between people, and the secrets in their histories.For me, it was a shock and then a comfort to be reading a novel about someone going home after a long time away to be with a mother who has cancer, since that is what my summer looks like it will be. Despite all the other stories swirling around it, that was the story I paid the most attention to, and cared the most about. And the turtles, I really cared about the turtles. There is so much in here that I might read it differently in a different year, but I really need to read the book he wrote about his father next -The Great Santini. You can't escape contemporary southern literature without acknowledging Pat Conroy, and you can't escape the man himself if you are around anything book related in the state of South Carolina. He's a southern superstar.
