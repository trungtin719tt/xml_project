Much better than the movie! It depicts the story from the wife as well as the husband point of view. It provided insight into what she suffered as a wife and endured the painful beatings, how she got away and the measures she took to survive. From her husbands' point of view she was to blame for him losing control and doing the things he did. He could quote scripture well but it never says in the Bible to beat your wife and keep her prisoner in your home. He kept such a tight reign that she couldn't leave the house without him, she had no friends, she had to continually change hairstylists so she didn't become too friendly with them, she could only go in the backyard because they had a privacy fence, she had to have a receipt for everything she bought and had to turn over the change to him and worst of all, he made her dress very attractive and wear heels all the time. In his mind she was happy, in love and had everything a woman could want from her husband......NOT! I wondered why she never poisoned him through his food but I believe fear kept her from doing it.Now in the city of Southport, she's finally feeling safe for the first time in years but knows she needs to keep her guard up because she knows her husband won't stop looking for her. She tries to keep to herself but this is a close knit community and she first befriends Jo, her next door neighbor and then Kristen, a four-year old that plays in the store her father, Alex, owns. One unexpected emergency occurs and their friendship starts to blossom into love but trouble is lurking its ugly head and coming their way.The magnetism of the story will leave you wanting more, happy for the outcome and surprised when you find out who Jo really is.
