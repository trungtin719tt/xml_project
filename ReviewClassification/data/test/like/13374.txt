By the pricking of my thumbs, something wicked this way comes!And how wicked it was! Carnival is coming to town but friends Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade aren't fooled - this is no ordinary carnival and they won't let the strange autumn people coming with it take over their town! So they, along with Will's glorious librarian father, discover the autumn people's secret and do everything they can to stop them.I started reading Bradbury because of his most famous story about the burning of books and then continued last year with his other Halloween book.Something Wicked This Way Comes, just like last year's Spooktober book, has a marvellous autumn-y atmosphere that makes you hear the leaves rustle, smell the crisp foggy air and see all the splendid colours this most beautiful season has to offer. Oh, and maybe you'll smell cotton candy in this particular case, too. ;POnce again, we get a wonderful adventure, this time experienced by two boys who grew up next to each other (they were born only 2 minutes apart) and are best friends. That sort of connection comes with benefits, as does a father who is a well-read bookworm and professional librarian (I LOVED Will's dad)! These monsters are definitely messing with the wrong people. *lol*In between the suspenseful action, we get one hell of a lot of meaningful and deep (but never boring or preachy) commentary on society in general, on fear and regret, on being young and growing old, on life and death - yes, all paradoxes and/or opposites. Truly glorious writing that enthralls!Moreover, I'm sure I know the narrator of this audio version, Paul Hecht, but for the life of me I couldn't remember from where. Anyway, he was brilliant in bringing the weirdness and terror of the carnival and its masters but also the vivid friendship of Will and Jim to life.
