I clearly was not in top form when I read this book and that's probably the only reason I gave this book 4 stars instead of 5. I managed to ruin this book for myself so, while this review itself may not help, I hope it will assist in making sure no one else makes the same mistake I did: I absolutely LOVED "Outlander" (the first book in this series) ... Then I really messed up. I was so excited to have read the book that I looked around to see if there was a second book. I then read "A Breath of Snow and Ashes". I was completely confused in the beginning and it took awhile to figure out how the books linked. Only after I was DONE (arggghhhhhhhhhhhhhh - still kicking myself years later ... ). Anyway, only after I was DONE with the "ashes" book did I realize I had just SKIPPED from BOOK ONE to BOOK SIX!!!!!!!! I was so angry because I KNOW for a FACT that I would have LOVED book two but now I figure why bother because I know how it all turns out. ACK! I feel cheated by my own stupidity ... don't make my mistake. Read them in this order (but check me because as you can see, I already messed up once):1. Outlander - FANTASTIC!2. Dragonfly In Amber3. Voyager4. Drums in Autumn5. The Fiery Cross6. Breath of Snow and AshesGrrr. Almost wish I hadn't just written this review. I haven't thought about this DUMB move in months.
