Ya'll, this is the sweetest book in the history of books! I read this one in high school, right before the movie with Natalie Portman came out. That turned out to be a bad idea, because the whole time I was in the theater I was analyzing how the book and the movie differed.Where the Heart Is tells the story of Novalee Nation, a pregnant teenager who's abandoned by her skank boyfriend in an unfamiliar Walmart. Novalee seems to charm everyone she meets, but she is naive at times and learns the hard way that not every person is trustworthy. Still, she has a strong soul and seems to prevail despite the hardships that are thrown at her.Novalee, despite the weird name, is one of the most realistic characters that I've ever read. I don't know what it is about her character, probably the fact that she's so freaking sweet and innocent that you can't help but like her, but she's still a favorite of mine after almost a decade.
