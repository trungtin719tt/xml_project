I Am Legend and Other Storiesimage:I have waited for a long time to read this novel and when I finally finished reading it...I would rather watch powdery looking vampires of Omega Man (1971) to light up my horror fuse. But because of the originality of the narratives, I am rating it a five as it was first published in 1954; and it most likely gave birth to futuristic masters' of horrors.The novel is not as horrific as I thought but more of a personal survival journey of the only man left on earth supposedly. The rest of the world has been doomed from the unknown apocalypse that had turned the rest of the public into blood sucking leeches. If I have read this book 63 years ago, I would say that I would have been hunkered down somewhere. Nine years earlier, the U.S. had just dropped atomic bombs over Japan but the exposure of the reality of Hiroshima and Nagasaki took place in the 1950s. The author Richard Matheson probably got the idea of the apocalypse from that era of atomic race with a twist of leeches. I mean, who hasn't thought about being the only person alive on earth, I have and I am curious to what it would be like.The protagonist Robert Neville is a vampire hunter in the daytime while barricading himself up at night. The usual vampire stuff like burning up in the daylight, refusal of garlic and onions, stake to the heart and scared of crosses. Neville is also an alcoholic and he is depressed most of the time because there are no women around, only slutty vampires that he must learn to hate or kill. Thus this gave him the purpose of doing scientific research about vamps. I was surprised, Matheson put that much knowledge of real scientific and theoretical process in his novel.I believe the most disturbing moments is the story is of a stray dog that Neville encounters. The emotional attachment and friendly companion perhaps was too much. Not mentioning as what happened to his wife that is another story...yet I can see governments imposing laws and quarantine people during chaotic times. I see Mr. Neville is a drunken comedian as well. While during research on vamps, he knew vamps would be scared of crosses; but what would happen if the vampire was a Muslim or Jew and how would they react when faced with the cross, perhaps he/she would still come after you.This novel also has some short stories as well by Matheson. Dress of White Silk and Mad House, I considered to be superb. Others are okay to just bizarre. I recommend to read the book at least once.image:
