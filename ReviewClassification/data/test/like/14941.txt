Sookie. You somewhat did a bit better here, but not really.First off, I enjoyed the book. The plot surrounding the attacks on shape shifters was a great mystery, although it was quite easy to pin point the culprit. I like how the vampires are on the sidelines in the story. Sure Bill, Charles and Eric are present but it's not about them. Charles has the most lines in this book and even there, I don't feel like he's that much present.With the story revolving around Sookie and who shot the shape shifters, I got to learn a bit more about other supernatural beings like the ritual for werewolf leadership.And of course, everyone proclaims their love to Sookie. The town reject all of the sudden turned super star. Everyone wants a piece of Sookie.She is the one ring. Everyone wants her now that she's been discovered!
