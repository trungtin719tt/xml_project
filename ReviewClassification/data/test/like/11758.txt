What an amazing story!!! It is questionable as to what is true and what is not...many people have poked holes in Henri's story since its publication. However, still a fantastic book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys a good old school adventure story of daring prison breaks and survival even when all seems lost. Since reading this book, I eat a coconut nearly everyday and think of the author in his little 3x3
