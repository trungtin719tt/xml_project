Love this book. I was talking about it with my brother last night because he brought up an organization he's doing work for that looks to fund candidates who are community service oriented. One of their goals is to have half the House and Senate be veterans by 2020. I said i thought that was a great idea and that I thought we should go even further and demand all public servants have some sort of military service to achieve a high office. He disagreed and said it takes all types to be a leader and some fit in different way sand bring different things to the table. Keep in mind that we're both veterans with him having been an officer in the USMC and myself in the Navy from a long line of men and women who have served. He's never read the book so he's downloading it and then we can talk about it again after he's gone through it. I really love books that are written as a fun adventure story but have all these deep nuances when you dig into them. I like this one and the Empire by Orson Scott for the same kind of writing although it's a lot more overt in that novel.
