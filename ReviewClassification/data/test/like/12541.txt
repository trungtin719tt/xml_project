Prior to the twentieth century, people suffering from mental illness were thought to be "alienated" from their true nature. Experts in the study of mental pathologies were known as Alienist.I first heard of this book last year when I heard it was becoming a tv show on TNT, I intended to read it then but just never got around to it. Earlier this year I watched the first episode of the show and found it visually stunning. So like any normal person I decided not to watch another episode until I had read the book.....Then I waited months to read the book.The Alienist deals with very dark and heavy subject matters. Dr. Laszlo Kreizler and his crew are hunting down the killer of child prostitutes, in 1896 New York. I learned from this book and some online research that for much of the 19th &amp; early 20th centuries child prostitution was perfectly legal and the most popular form of child prostitution featured little boys as young as 5 dressing up as girls. The majority of these kids were immigrants. This book is extremely graphic and at times made me feel nauseated.Caleb Carr did an outstanding job bringing Gilded Age New York to life. I love when Historical Fiction mixes fictional characters with real people. The Alienist features cameos from Theodore Roosevelt and J.P. Morgan to name just a few.The Alienist is dark, edgy, smart, and gripping. I recommend it but its not for everyone.2018 Popsugar Reading Challenge: a book you meant to read in 2017Around The Year In 52 Reads: A medical or legal thriller
