I just want to say that I have very mixed feelings about this book. It is one of my favorite love stories of all time. It is not some mere trite story. It is meaningful and deep.However be warned, it does have what I have referred to before as "content". There is a part near the beginning where she is abused. Skip it. There is a part at the very end after they are married. There you go. So if you read it, and want to come away unscathed, be careful. Start at the part where Red finds her(maybe start somewhere in the middle and work your way back to it) and end when Red is finished with his story he tells at the end of the book. Oh, one more thing. Red has a nasty uncle who is--well nasty. You might want to skip some of his dialog towards end to our heroine--don't remember how bad it got, but you knew where is thoughts were going.I do not recommend any of the other books in this series. I haven't actually read them, but I skimmed enough to know that they were not for me. While Daughter of the Forest has "content" in it, I felt the characters were very moral. I was disappointed with where she took the series. To me, the heroes where so flawed that they disappointed me, not to mention that there is "content" in those books as well. One of my pet peeves about book series is when you develop a love for characters who triumphed in the first book and then they totally messed up in the second one. From what I could tell this happened in the series, but like I said, I only skimmed.
