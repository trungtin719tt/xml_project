Okay, I just discovered I had this on my TBR list, but I had already read it years ago. Ha. So I am rating it based on how I remembered it. At the time, I thought this was a fun, sexy romance. Who knows what I would think now. If you are new to paranormal romance, I can almost guarantee you will like this. If you've read tons of it already, you're not going to get anything new here.I liked the premise at the time and the main guy was hot. I am pretty sure he was your typical alpha. If you like Kresley Cole and Gena Showalter, you'll like this. All of these PNRs follow a fairly similar formula.
