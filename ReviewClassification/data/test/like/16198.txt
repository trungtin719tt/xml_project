My sis and my spy have both been PESTERING me to read this series. I finally found the first book at the library....and now I completely understand why they love it so much. And why the books make everyone hungry...lol.I dearly love strong and silent hero types....and Halt fit that bill wonderfully. Will and Horace showed excellent character development. I really want to shadow a Ranger now...RW Ratings:Language: 4 stars. 5 instances of d*** and 1 instance of h***. All of which were very unnecessary and could have been easily substituted with a cleaner option. *rolls eyes*Abuse: 4 stars. Horace is physically and mentally bullied a fair bit by other, very mean sophomore apprentices. Quite a lot of fighting as well.Lust: 4 1/2 stars. 1 instance of mild kissing (really? Seriously? Why? Did you HAVE to add that little romantic morsel, Flanagan??). Oh yes...and there is innocent mention of...hem...rabbits mating. Granted, it was portrayed in a humorous light but REALLY? It was one of those cringey instances where all you can do is just laugh.
