Well i do not usually compare any book with Harry potter but this one here just made me do so. It was an amazing read. Nearly everything about the book is just great.Jonathan created a new magical world where magicians have no power of themselves. They use the spirits(imps, djinnis,afrits) to complete their every tasks through summoning and commanding them. They are arrogant, boastful, self-centered creatures(the magicians). Every magician is assigned to train an apprentice.The main protagonist of the book Nathaniel is an apprentice. He is under the surveillance of a scrawny, not-so-powerful mr. Underwood. Soon he gets into enemity with Simon lovelace - a hedious magician thriving on want of power. And in process of seeking revenge he gets intertwined between far large conspiracy than he could ever imagine. so he summons a djinni to help himself.Here comes the name Character Bartimaeus. Ah!! What a charecter. Surely the best that i've read in a long time. Funny, wicked, intelligent and of great power.The thing that i am most impressed with is the writing style. Just brilliant!!! Specially in Bartimaeus's POV. The footnotes!! I dont remember the last time i've read such humorous and wicked footnotes!!!The plot itself was great too, surely there is a second plot going underneath the first one that will surely to be continued in the next installment of the book. I am looking forward to reading the Golem's Eye pretty soon :)
