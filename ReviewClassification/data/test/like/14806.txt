Oh, the joy of reading this book! It was wise and poignant and marinated in song:"Singing was in my father as sight is in the eye.""Sing, then. Sing, indeed, with shoulders back, and head up so that song might go to the roof and beyond to the sky. Mass on mass of tone, with a hard edge, and rich with quality, every single note a carpet of colour woven from basso profundo, and basso, and baritone, and alto, and tenor, and soprano, and alto and mezzo, and contralto, singing and singing, until life and all things living are become a song."Memories of a Welsh coal miner's family home are deftly painted on the mind's eye, simple but rich scenes:" Indeed, if happiness has a smell, I know it well, for our kitchen has always had it faintly, but in those days it was all over the house.""Dear little house that I have lived in, there is happiness you have seen, even before I was born. In you is my life, and all the people I have loved are a part of you, so to go out of you, and leave you, is to leave myself."Life in the green valley was destined to be marred by lack of stewardship. The ugly slag of the coal mine eventually swallowed up the beauty, and the idyllic life is likewise swallowed up by divisions and rifts created by labor disputes. The beautiful sense of family and community is shattered, but the reader savors every single crystalline memory along with the narrator.One of the themes was justice, and the folks in the coal mining community derived their sense of justice from the Bible. They were absolutely unified around their principles. I was surprised by their swiftness in carrying out justice and their pride in making it a local affair rather than one to entrust to English authorities. I was equally surprised by their literary acuity, the high caliber of their musicality, and their poetry. These were not backward simpletons, but people who had huge caches of beautiful words and songs and recipes that were not saved only for special occasions. They lived and breathed daily beauty in the midst of the black coal waste that eventually snuffed it out."And nothing more I hate than a table laid without care. Stains on a cloth, or wrinkles, or a knife not in the straight, a fork turned aside, a spoon put the wrong way up, will have my thoughts in a knot until they are put right."Here are lovely memories laid out as a feast---sad ones, too--- that create an enduring and satisfying picture of domestic contentment. This book is a delight to read and to remember.
