It took abit of time from reading Tempted to Burned. And if you cried in Tempted. You will die in burned. No but I cried and cried and cried. I would say one of the best books in this gener.Zoey has a hard time right now.

So they search through old books about a warrior bringing back his High Priestess. But all they find out is that all warriors succeded to come to the 'otherland' but the mission to come there was to hard so they died. So it all ended up with both of them died.But Stark, a young hot warrior, find a way to not die but still get there.This book was beautiful written. Full of disire and also heart breaking in the end.
