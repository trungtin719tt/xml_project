How this series continues to amaze me. I don't know how, and I don't know why. It hasneverhappened before. Never have I believed that every book of a six book series would be two trios of stunningly beautiful books. Well, I believe so now. Alyson Noel is amazing. Her writing though... wow. Alyson Noel has topped my top author chart. I just love her writing, somehow it gets to me a lot. I totally understand Ever, and I feel her frustration just through Alyson Noel's writing. What's my recommendation? Read the immortals series. It's most definitely worth it. After that? Come back here and obsess with me over it. Believe me, I think they're that good.
