"Your soul is blowing apart."The chorus in Anne Carson's translation ofSophoclesANTIGONEI love Antigone. I think it is one of the very best of the Greek tragedies ~~ no one of the very best of all tragedies ever written.Random thought ~~ I suspect there is a play that is part of this cycle that is missing ~~ a play that focuses on the brothers.This review will not focus on the play itself, but on the wonderful translation by Anne Carson.Anne Carson is a poet. She is a wordsmith in the highest sense of the word. She has an ear for modern language that makes this translation fresh and contemporary while honoring Sophocles true intention. Carson's translation is full of dry, dark humor and avoids the pitfalls of those dour, humorless translations that are of one note and written to emulate a funeral dirge. But more importantly, Carson shows that Kreon, not Antigone, is the true tragic character of the work. He refuses to heed the wisdom of others, when Kreon relents at the last, only to find his family dead and his city in despair.The residue of those boring, stuffy late 19th / early 20th century translations that attempted to emulate Elizabethan English and place Antigone in the realm of a Shakespearean tragedy have been cast off by Carson. But, ultimately, I think it would be best to call this an adaptation rather than a translation.ANTIGONE: WE BEGIN IN THE DARK AND THE BIRTH OF DEATH IS USISMENE: WHO SAID THATANTIGONE: HEGELISMENE: SOUNDS MORE LIKE BECKETTANTIGONE: HE WAS PARAPHRASING HEGELThe chorus in Anne Carson's translation ofSophoclesANTIGONEAnne Carson means to have a good time with Antigone, and thankfully she invites us along to the party.
