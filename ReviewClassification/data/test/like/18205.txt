I ran across a website that had some free books hosted online (legally) when I was bored, and saw Brave New World, so I decided to give it a try.I read about half of it on my computer and then decided that it was absolutely worth going out and buying it.There were some times where I found myself mixing up some of the characters- but I think a lot of that comes from starting it at 3am. I didn't find that it detracted from the story though, because the plot was straightforward enough that you could kind of sort things out after the fact. But really, that's the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars. I'm willing to bet that it was probbly due to being sleepless- but still, looking back- it seems as though it was just too easy to confuse the characters while reading. (but again- easy enough to sort out after the fact)Some books just pop up at the right time. I mean, in a societal sense, it's a great time to revist the message of Brave New World, but even on a personal level- I found myself really challenged by some of the ideas examined by Huxley.Is an easy path- the path of least resistence, really worth the benefits of hard work that you're giving up along the way? I've been presented with some decisions that are based solely on that exact thought- so hitting these ideas in the book, granted at an exaggerated level, but still- it's been a really good reminder.I watched Gattaca in my 9th grade Biology class, and I've been somewhat interested in these strange utopian societies ever since...and I've got to say- Huxley's Brave New World only amped up that interest! It's disturbingly creepy, tragic, and absolutely fascinating all at once!Passion is worth the struggle and the pain. Pain and passion go hand in hand.
