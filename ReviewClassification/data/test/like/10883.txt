I just love Lewis's descriptions and creativity and the way he weaves stories together, and The Silver Chair is another shining example of his giftedness.It's a sad sort of story to read at times because Narnia is changing once again and old friends are gone or dead or dying. There's just a strange thread of grief wound through it that's hard to describe, this sense that all this sadness is not the way it's supposed to be.But the last chapter is called The Healing of Harms, and I cried while reading it. Because all this sadness ISN'T the way it's supposed to be. But one day everything sad will come untrue, and we will see the country we've been saved to see.(Also, seven cheers for Puddleglum.)
