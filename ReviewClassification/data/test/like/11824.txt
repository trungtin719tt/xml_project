Fantastic.It's an interview with various themes of human life centering around mythology. It's not about stories, books, movies... just the myths, how and why they appeared, how and why they shaped and still shape lives and society, how they adapt (or we adapt them) and so on.He also tackles on issues that even almost 30 years after the book's publishing are still rampant, or even more rampant than before, like violence, issues in love, maturing too late, fanaticism and so on and I think he does a pretty good job in explaining a big part of those issues.Since myths are a way of telling stories and adding meanings to them, no wonder this became a "bible of stories".
