Absolutely agree,"Any teacher can take a child to classroom, but not every teacher can make him learn". ~Helen KellerI'm truly inspired by Helen Keller, she's a wonderful woman. One of the most beautiful &amp; inspirational autobiography -biography I have ever read.I'm in awe what an extraordinary imagination she had, she was blind but honestly she can see more than me. The way she pictures her surroundings is exceptional. She's a true symbol of hope.What could be more beautiful than this!"What a joy it is to feel the soft, springy earth under my feet once more, to follow grassy roads that lead to ferny brooks where I can bathe my fingers in a cataract of rippling notes or to clamber over a stone wall into green fields that tumble and roll and climb in riotous gladness". ~ Helen Keller"Everything has its wonders, even darkness and silence, and I learn whatever state I may be in, therein to be content". ~Helen Keller
