Edited:You know a book has made an impact (for better or for worse) when you're still thinking about it days after writing the review. I don't feel my initial thoughts were conveyed adequately, and I have a few things to get off of my chest! (I still liked the book, though).What I said a few days ago:Wow. That was not how I remembered things happening at all!All of the big spoiler-y news items were pretty anticlimactic really. And Sookie took, most of it, in stride. I noticed, however, that where the men were obnoxious last time, Sookie had a chip on her shoulder this time around, long before the bottom fell out.That being said, quite a few storylines concluded (or at least came to a natural resting place) in this installment, making the ending feel like intermission during a play or musical. If book seven,All Together Dead, is meant to be the start of Act II, I hope its a good one.I am curious to see what happens next with Sookie and her multitude of men.What I'm adding now:*****Warning! Spoilery Spoilers Spoiled Past This Point!*****No, seriously! Turn back now unless you want spoilers.First of all,Definitely Deadis the perfect title for this installment of the series.-Cousin Hadley - Definitely Dead!-Bitch Debbie Pelt &amp; the secret surrounding her death- Definitely Dead! (-Nice, trusting Sookie and her ordinary life experiences &amp; limited world view - Definitely Dead!-Sookie &amp; Bill's relationship - Definitely Dead! (Well, maybe)As mentioned above, all sorts of truths are revealed, and I realized that I lied about Sookie taking "most" of it in stride. She didn't.She seemed fine learning that she is part fairy. (I could have sworn that her response was more emphatic, but I am probably thinking about the show). She was in denial for a second but realized just about everything she went through over the last year or so made more sense.She flipped her wig, however, when she learned about Bill's true intentions upon returning to Bon Temps. I don't blame her one bit. The only thing I wished was that we, the audience, could hear hisside of the storyexcuse.That's the sucky part about the first-person narrative. You don't always get to know what others know.I'm assuming, that it would have been along the lines of "I didn't love you when we started, but now I can't live without you ... blah, blah, blah." When all was said and done, the earlier scene, where she shut the door in his face, filled me with bitter glee.My other feelings include:I think Eric forcing a confession when he did was a dick move! Sookie really didn't need that dropped on her on top of everything else. Then again, Bill was keeping close tabs on her, so I suppose then was better than never.I'm happy the Debbie Pelt situation has been put to rest (although I'm sure Sandra has other ideas).I like Quinn as a character (who doesn't love tigers), but I don't think he's right for Sookie. He feels very much like a rebound, and that isn't fair to either of them.I don't even know what to think of Alcede anymore; I felt Sookie was unfair before but upon further review... Meh. If they get together, cool, if they don't, that's cool too.I don't think I'm going to like Amanda. Who the hell turns their lover into a cat without knowing how to turn them back!?!In other words, this book put me through an emotional wringer of ups, downs, and sideways!Also, I think this is one of the wordiest reviews I've ever written.
