This was, truly, "fast-paced non-fiction." This book galloped along with all the speed of the horse it followed, which I find rare for books that simply relate a true story. Hillenbrand did a fantastic job giving a straightforward account of the history and background of Seabiscuit and the people around him, yet not once did she stoop to sounding like a pedantic authority on the subject. This book had all the tone and pace of great novels I've read, but it was so interesting to keep reminding myself that it actually happened!If you enjoyed the movie, you will definitely enjoy the book. The movie did a great job capturing what Hillenbrand did, with applaudingly similar style, but it couldn't have captured all the depth and side-stories that the book offered. I was initially worried that I would be forced to superimpose the faces from the movie onto the characters I was reading about, but the deftly-placed pictures in the book helped me get over that quickly.All in all, a fantastic book. Highly recommended.
