2018 is the year where I graduate and become a faux adult (or whatever), but I'll probably remember it as the year I read the whole bibliography of Bret Easton Ellis. Other than Imperial Bedrooms and Informers, most of his works seem to work well with me. Lunar Park starts as a honest memoir and then turns into a freakshow and then clusterfuck of bunch of random clusterfucks. This is his only book written in past tense and it certainly feels a bit deviated from his other works. But, did I really like this book? I'm not sure. It was chaos forced all over the place. But again, it's Bret Easton Ellis and I'm biased. One can call Lunar Park a satire like his other books, but it reads like a vague apology (with fake nonchalance) for American psycho (which wasn't necessary anyway). Unlike his other books, this one does have a plot and things happen in every page and there's not a single boring moment. But I'd still pick LTZ over middle aged BEE any given day.
