I read Chris's copy. He brought it to the library and said, "Read the real thing and not that other garbage." I guess that's a step up from "read this or die." I really have readers looking out for me, eh?It took me a good while to get through this, but I'm glad I did. I've now read a classic and I can agree with Chris that one should read the "real thing" as well as the graphic novel adaptation. What the graphic novel missed in distilling down 300-plus pages was the descriptions: Jacques writes some lovely prose, with sun-drenched landscapes to rival L.M. Montgomery's, and meals that would make Laura Ingalls Wilder jealous. Plus, the similes: "The reply sounded like the whisper of wet silk across a smooth slate"; "gliding like a cloud's shadow cast upon the ground by the moon."I admired the use of three plotlines at once (Cluny's story, Matthias's story, and Redwall's story) to keep me turning pages. I liked the many brave female characters -- boys didn't get to have all the fun! I also liked the different animals' dialects, and the short chapters and many breaks in the text. The action was satisfying and helped balance some of the potential cutesyness (a mouse may drink berry juice out of an acorn cup, but soon a rat will be speared with an arrow). The relentless logic in my head had to be quelled ("can a squirrel really sit on a mouse's shoulder? can a sparrow really carry a sword? ack! suspsend disbelief! suspend disbelief!"), and at first I had a hard time believing in Matthias's seemingly instant transformation from bumbling apprentice to fierce warrior. I'm not sure if I will pursue the rest of the series; it may be time to read a "Warriors" book while I'm still in Animal Mode.
