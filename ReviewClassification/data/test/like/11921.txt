There's not much I can say about this book that won't potentially sound cliche to those who have read and believe in this book or absolutely ridiculous to those who, having read it or not, do not believe in this book. But if there are a few things I can say that might pique your interest in reading it if you do not already have an opinion on the book, it might be these. 1)I know it is true; 2) It is evidence that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is a Christian church; and 3) It can change your life.If you're interested in reading it, you can easily get a free copy. You can even have two missionaries come to your house and it will be like having your own little book club! You can also request a free copy of the Bible from this site (see links at the bottom of the page):http://www.mormon.org/mormonorg/eng/b...
