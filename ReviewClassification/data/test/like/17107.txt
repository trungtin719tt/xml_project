When you ask what makes a book a classic, this might offer a useful case study. It's difficult imagining this book winning a modern literary prize, yet it finds itself securely in any number of highly diverse literature reading lists. Add to that a repackaging and republication after a generation spurred by an as-good-as-it's-gonna-get movie (an eye-candy gem with Brad Pitt and Tom Skerritt) based on the book, and, well, folks just keep reading (and being pleasantly surprised by) it.Thematically, uh, gee, where to start? Brothers and fathers and nature (and mountains and rivers) and fishing and logging (and working with your hands) and walking (and boots) and coming of age and fighting and religion and in-laws and money (and gambling) and prostitution and ... and ... Organizationally, it's neither fish nor fowl, realistically being more accurately a collection of three mostly unrelated novellas than anything else, withA River Runs Through Itbeing the most widely read and remembered.I couldn't get the wordlanguidout of my head as I read this, which is weird, because the protagonists are anything but.... Maclean's writing reads at a leisurely pace - walk, don't run, he seems to suggest - and doesn't think twice about repetition or doubling back over ground previously covered. You can imagine Maclean reading his stories around a campfire or trapped in mountain shelter while waiting out a storm. A unique style, but one brimming with art and wisdom and grace...And, of course, if you enjoy this, be sure to try the remarkableYoung Men and Fire.
