Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seais a marine adventure book, which can be qualified even fiction novel; one of the first novels of science fiction.In 1864, when this book came out, no underwater trip had been done, reported, Jules Verne therefore allows to imagine from scientific basis for certain facts (pressure, temperature,... different seas and oceans traveled) and more spooky for cross creatures. We say what avant-garde with this fully electrified submarine, its autonomous suits and which are used for humanistic and non-military purposes!This novel is a real dashboard where we follow our four protagonists, we dive with them to discover the splendors of the sea, and the beautiful illustrations of Neuville adds to this part of fabulous. Admittedly, some passages are very (too?) precise, very (too?) detailed in classification of species, in maritime coordinates but we must not forget that this dashboard is held by the imminent Professor Oronnax.We are fascinated by Captain Nemo: What happened to him for wanting so much to leave the Earth forever? Why so much hate and rancor towards men, to the point of attacking their boats? Can we blame him, without knowing his past and knowing what men are capable of? Is it more to blame than the men who leave at the beginning of the novel hunt down the "monster" sailor to kill him because it harms the navigators?
