I was rather sceptical towards this book at first. I was expecting to get a cheap and uninspired Harry Potter-copy but this book, in fact, doesn't have much in common with JK Rowling's popular saga.This book description here sums things up very well:"Nathaniel is a magician's apprentice, taking his first lessons in the arts of magic. But when a devious hot-shot wizard named Simon Lovelace ruthlessly humiliates Nathaniel in front of his elders, Nathaniel decides to kick up his education a few notches and show Lovelace who's boss. With revenge on his mind, he summons the powerful djinni, Bartimaeus. But summoning Bartimaeus and controlling him are two different things entirely, and when Nathaniel sends the djinni out to steal Lovelace's greatest treasure, the Amulet of Samarkand, he finds himself caught up in a whirlwind of magical espionage, murder, and rebellion."I love this new approach and definition of being a "wizard" here in Stroud's world: Wizards don't perform magic themselves. They need to summon demons like Djinn, Foliot, Imps, Afrits or Marids to do so.And that's were the trouble really begins because those demons are vicious things, trying to trick or harm their masters whereever they can. It so happens with Nathaniel and Bartimaeus.The story itself takes quite a while before it really kicks off and there are some rather dragging parts in between as well, but the POVs of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus really make up for this because they are justhilarious!The Amulet of Samarkand is darker and the characters are a lot more snarky and edgy than, for example, JK Rowling's characters. The book is full of funny remarks and potshots.(I have to say though that I'mNOTa fan of the footnotes. Theyarefunny but I found them really distracting as they interrupt the flow of the narrative.)The highlight of the book is, without any doubt, the love-hate relationship of Nathaniel and Bartimaeus and it was so heartwarming when Bartimaeus told Nathaniel at the end of the book that(view spoiler)[he has everything it takes to be a great wizard and that he should always be careful and take care of himself... awwww!!!(hide spoiler)].I really became a fan of their relationship!The book has a really great showdown that I could envision all the way through.All in all, the book is a real fun ride and I'm curious to see where the second book will be taking us!
