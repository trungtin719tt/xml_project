I am absolutely in love with this series! For me, it is a really big shame that i did not find it sooner.There is a lot that i could say about this first book in the series, and believe me i would if i could, but i would probably never stop talking and i would go over the word limit for reviews.First of all the story kicked off to a really good start. It was a thrilling and exciting first chapter. When i opened the book i saw that the chapters were like 20-30 pages long. For me, i was really worried. It seems that all the books i read that have really long chapters, end up being really long, dull, boring books. It's like a jinx to me. But this book seems to of broken that pattern. But although they seems long, they were very fast to read. The is a lot going on in the book, and something excting happens in every chapter...it made me keep on reading.Secondly the character's. How many books have i read and not liked the main character?- To many, but there are also ones i hate. But in all honesty, Claire is a likable character. They all are really. Sure, she can be stupid at times, but that's just who she is, and it is that, that makes her so realistic and interesting character.I can see there is going to be a romance somewhere along the line, but it's not in the book as much as some book do. When it's in your face all the time. This book has the romance, but it is off to the side, keeping up with the storyline alongside. It's more about the problem rather then the romance, which don't get me wrong, i love a good romance book as much as the next person, it's just not made a big deal ofThe storyline is great, the style of writing is wonderful and the characters are loveable! What's not to love?It ended on a cliffhanger which is really annoying as i don't have the next book(s) yet, but i will soon .Happy reading...
