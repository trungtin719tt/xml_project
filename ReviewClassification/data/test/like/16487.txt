Because it was a new one by Longfellow, I had to get it right away. You never know what you're getting with this writer, but I always wind up with something I savor to the last page. This time it's about a lonely housewife (not my thing) at the end of her rope (not my thing) who just gives up (not my thing) so does as the title says, walks away to die (not my thing). Since she lives in some 'burb in Tucson, Arizona, what she walks into is the Sonoran desert, the one with the really tall armed cactus plants. And the spiders and snakes and gila monsters and hot hot hot. The desert is my thing so I walked with her. I am so glad I did. As I already said, I savored it to the last page. A great last page, by the way. Great.
