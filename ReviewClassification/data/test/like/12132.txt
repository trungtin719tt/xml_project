Rosmund Pilcher is someone I discovered on holiday in Cyprus. I had finished reading all the books I had taken, and in the hotel there was a BIG book by here called Winter Solstice. Because I had nothing else to do I started to read it.the story is about a woman of 60, ex actress who is involved with a man, of a certain age, who has just lost his wealthy wife and only daughter. The woman takes him under her wings, and he is kicked out of his house by the step sons. the plot involves a house in Scotland where they go, different people in her family, an English man coming back from America. Most of the action is over a Christmas. It is fantastically written, again I would agree with one review that says 'Her books are food for the sou'. It is another book I can read over again and the characters have become like friends to me. My hightest praise is that I do care about these characters.
