This review covers both the first and second Jungle Books, which are included in this edition. These included a lot of material which surprised me.I was not aware how much Disney altered the original material. Mowgli is so much more than a whiny git. Kipling's Mowgli is very much a proto-Conan. Kipling is more of a master of the action scene than Robert E. Howard, and the influence seems clear to me. Another clear influence is the discussion of civilization versus barbarism within the Jungle Book stories. Kipling presented a subtle view making it clear that neither is a clear winner. This debate of civilization versus barbarism is one that Lovecraft and Howard continued in their correspondence and stories.I really loved most of the Mowgli stories, particularly considering they were way more violent than I expected. Kaa's Hunting presents the original kidnapping of Mowgli by the monkeys, and his rescue is tense and bloody. It also includes an amusing lesson in the importance of learning one's school lessons. The King's Ankus has a very interesting take on the "barbaric" view on treasure, and also the value of leaving entombed treasure lie.My favorite of the non-Mowgli stories included Rikki Tikki Tavi as well as The Undertakers. Rikki Tikki Tavi is a favorite from my childhood, and I was unaware that it was a Jungle Book story until my recent excursion. This one holds up amazingly well, as the action is well paced and the tension is gripping. In addition, Rikki is not a British colonialist in a mongoose suit. Rikki is Mongoose. The people are almost peripheral to the story, and are almost, but not quite, a macguffin in order to provide Rikki with opportunities to kick some serious snake ass. The Undertakers has some seriously dark and subtle humor. The eponymous characters are all self-important carrion eaters. Their braggadocio storytelling ends in delightfully macabre justice.
