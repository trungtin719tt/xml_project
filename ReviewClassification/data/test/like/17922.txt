This is my first Alexander Pushkin. Eugene Onegin is a novel written in verse, rather in the same realm as Lord Byron's Don Juan. I read a biography of his life a long time ago, and after then I tried to read some of his poetry and couldn't get my mind to digest them. Finally after all these years I have. I like what I've read.Alexander Pushkin is the father of modern Russian poetry and literature. I will be reading more of his work both poetry and prose. Pushkin had a fascinating heritage. He was of African ancestry on his mother's side. His African great grandfather was the adopted son of Tsar Peter the Great.I enjoyed Eugene Onegin. The poem's namesake is a young man which I infer had been a playboy in the upper-crust of Russian society, but who had become bored with the vapidness of it all and retired to the country, a recently turned misanthrope, where he becomes the heroic romantic obsession of a naive young girl named Tatyana.Eugene Onegin was made into an opera by Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. Below is the letter scene from the opera sung by Russian opera singer Anna Netrebko:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d56MM...My favorite stanza from the Eugene Onegin is this:Alas, our youth was what we made it,something to fritter and to burn,when hourly we ourselves betrayed it,and it deceived us in return;when our sublimest aspiration,and all our fresh imagination,swiftly decayed beyond recalllike foliage in the rotting fall.It's agony to watch the hollowsequence of dinners stretch away,to see life as a ritual play,and with the decorous throng to followalthough one in no manner sharesits views, its passions, or its cares!
