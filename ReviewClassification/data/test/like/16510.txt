At first I thought this was a "light read" from Longfellow after her amazing research, gorgeous writing and profound meaning in THE SECRET MAGDALENE and FLOW DOWN LIKE SILVER. Or from HOUDINI HEART, a study in the psychology of the creative mind. But as I read along, delighting in the adventures of Mrs. Warren, I realized it was much more than a light read. It expresses a universal theme, one shared not only by women but by men. The goals and rewards we've accepted in the Western world (and increasingly in parts of the world who look to the west for inspiration) are hollow and unsatisfying. We think money will make us happy. We dream of owning things. We long for status. We look around and see people not in our group as the "other" and are afraid of them so we react with hostility. We pollute our amazing brains with religion (I don't mean the spiritual, I mean codified beliefs about reality that serve the masters of our precious minds: priests, ayatollahs, rabbis, gurus, whatever). But we aren't happy. The more money we have, the more we want. The more status we have, the more we worry others are more powerful or important. The more stuff we acquire, the more it burdens us to carry it. And secretly or not so secretly we want to run away from it all. We want true freedom from what our world sells us as worthy. It's not much of a secret that so many of us would walk away if we could. But we are buried under beliefs and possessions and obligations. As I read this book I realized I was reading the dream. To throw it all away, to be afraid and yet to walk into a wilderness of the soul. Mrs. Warren shed her tattered shabby skin and became Molly Brock. From a weak mess of a valium addicted, unloved and abandoned housewife, she became a master of her soul. This is a light read in one away (so smooth, so easy, such subtle touches) but in another it's as profoundly important as anything Longfellow has written. As a fan, this is saying a lot.
