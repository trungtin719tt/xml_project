10.07.18: Kindle offer for 1.99$.I loved this book although it is not perfect and there were some things about it that annoyed me a tiny bit. But well.. love is not a logical thing so...As other reviewers said it is combination of Ocean 11 (with a younger and more cheekier main character) and the Godfather. I would also add the bloodiness of Game of Thrones ((view spoiler)[ and the inclination to kill some of the lovable characters(hide spoiler)]) and some Jaws.The main character Locke Lamora is an antihero, he has as many flaws as talents and maybe this is why he is so likable. His main quality and doom is his devotion to his friends. I loved the humor, the cursing (a lot of f-words), the characters, the writing, the pace. The fantasy world is described in painstaking detail which was a bit too much for me at some point. The author introduces long descriptions just when the action is at its peak. It made me fast read a couple of them. This was my only problem but I saw that it was exactly what some other reviewers loved about the book.I can't wait to read the sequel. I hope is just as good.
