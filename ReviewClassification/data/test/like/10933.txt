I likedIf I Stay, but I absolutely lovedWhere She Went. I'm having a hard time trying to compile my thoughts on the novel because I'm still reeling from the deep, heartbreaking effect it had on me.Tatiana's reviewsaid what I've been thinking most of all:"I mean, If I Stay was all about people dying and lying in coma and there were hardly any tears in my eyes and here I spent hours sobbing over a guy's broken heart?"That about sums up the reaction I had. If someone asked you which would upset you more, you'd think the answer was obvious. A young girl losing her entire family in a car crash versus the angst of a lovesick rockstar... there should be no contest - right? But Forman conveys love and loss with such raw emotion.If I Staywas more subtle, told through mostly happy memories of the life Mia had shared with her family. It was... moving.Where She Wentwasn'tmoving, it was gut-wrenchingly sad. I mean "I've ran out of tissues" sad.I honestly felt every bit of sadness, despair and anger with Adam. I don't recall ever being so in tune with a male protagonist's emotions. In fact it's been an awful long time since I've cared so much about the outcome of any character. In most situations, characters like Adam would be made to seem selfish for thinking of themselves when Mia had lost pretty much everything in that car crash. Not here. Or at least, not in my opinion. Forman obviously has a real knack for getting inside a person's head and making the reader understand feelings that may otherwise be questionable.I definitely want to read more from Gayle Forman in the future. That the first two novels I've read by her would affect me so much just makes me wonder what else she has up her sleeves. I can't wait to find out.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube
