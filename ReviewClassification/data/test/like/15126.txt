Do you want to have the very foundations on the basis of which your whole outlook towards life has been shaped, questioned?Do you want to see the lines between so-called good and evil, right and wrong, the moral and immoral blurred to the extent you could not distinguish one from the other?Do you want to erase that cherished and precious point of reference, against which you have compared, weighed all your actions, thoughts and feelings so far?If the answer to the above 3 questions is yes, then go ahead and readAlbert Camus. You may end up falling in love with his work, his notions on moral ambiguity and grudgingly marveling at his genius.Did I love this book? Yes.Did I understand every aspect of it? Yes and No. Might take me a few more reads.Did I love the prose? Oh hell yes.Do I know whether to label this book as a kind of doctrine on nihilism or existentialism or a curious combination of both? Oh hell no.
