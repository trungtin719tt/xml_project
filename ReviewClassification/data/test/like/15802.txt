This book makes no sense, not that it matters. Burroughs wrote it over the course of a year in a one-room apartment over a Moroccan male brothel, strung out on heroin. What resulted is a disturbing, satirical, bitter flood of images. To call it a meditation or a portrait doesn't do it justice: "Naked Lunch" is the lifeblood of a dying mind. It is a collection of vaguely-linked scenes, images, and flash pieces some humor, some horror, some pornography. As you might expect, it drags in places, but some of the imagery is so dementedly brilliant that it deserves to be read. Besides, if you get too tired of it, you can always mark your place and come back to it in a year. Don't worry--it'll make as little sense as it did before.
