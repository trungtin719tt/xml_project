This book was a huge thing when I was in the fifth grade. The film was coming out, and it was one of the pioneers of the YA dystopian genre. My sister told me I should read this one, despite my adamant hatred of the similarThe Hunger Games... I'm glad I gaveThe City of Embera chance because it's an inspiring, spectacular tale of friendship, shady politics, horrid underground conditions, and the story of how humanity rises again.
