Walk Two Moons is a children's book -- or is it? I purchased this book as a nightly read for when we take two of our grandchildren to Florida for a week. I'm not sure how the girls will feel about it, but I thought it was wonderful. It introduces Salamanca (known as "Sal"), age 13 whose world was upended two years ago. Her father finally moves them to another town where he has befriended a lady (Mrs. Cadaver). Mrs. Cadaver's husband is missing and Sal is thoroughly convinced that Mrs. Cadaver has buried him in the back yard. It is summer and Sal's grandparents have come to take her on a road trip to Iowa. Her grandparents aren't your normal grandparents - a bit quirky, a bit forgetful - and not someone I would feel comfortable letting take my child cross country. But in the course of their road trip (which takes some hilarious turns), she begins to tell them the story of her best friend, Phoebe, whose mother suddenly disappeared one day. Gran and Gramps look forward day and night to the adventures and saga of Sal and Phoebe.If looked at for the words only, this book could come across as a sad story, one of loss and grief. But in hindsight, I thought the author did a beautiful job of showing the simple emotions of a child. A mind and heart that has not yet experienced the hardships and disappointments that life can sometimes throw in your path can have difficulty dealing with and accepting obstacles, even death. I loved how Sal and Phoebe's teacher showed how children their age could show acceptance for another person even if there were things they didn't like about them. It was a touching story that showed how pealing away layers of doubt and misconception can reveal a picture worth admiring. Sometimes it is good to step back and read like a child, think like a child, enjoy life as a child - without worries and without blinders. I was moved by this story and hope that my granddaughters will feel the same.
