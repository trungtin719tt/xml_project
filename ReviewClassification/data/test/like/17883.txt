Part of the Pratchett reread with theSpecFic Buddy Readsgroup in 2019.The Hogfather, Discworld's Santa Claus analogue, is missing and Death is filling in. Death has also carefully instructed his granddaughter Susan Sto Helit not to get involved, so she leans into her family heritage and investigates the latest interference by the Auditors of Reality.This is one of the Discworld books that I've reread the most, including both print and audio, and I've seen the mini-series a couple of times. So it was actually surprising how much the book struck me this time around. It's easy to think of some of the great bits in this book like "the place where the falling angel meets the rising ape" and "you need to believe in things that aren't true. How else can theybecome?", but some of the subtler points stood out to me this time, like the description of flowering tube worms at the bottom of the ocean as "a tiny yes in the night".This definitely holds up on rereading and remains one of the best books of the entire series in my opinion.
