Actual 3.5Based simply on how this book culminated to its end I really wanted to give it 5 stars. But I just can't. I guess I'll discuss my problem with the story first and save the best (the reason I would really like to give it a 5) for last.One book in particular that always comes to my mind when thinking of dystopian literature is Cormack McCarthy's 'The Road'; the reason being the disturbing nature of the story. Nevil Shute's 'On The Beach' is a disturbing tale as well (a big reason for wanting to apply 5 stars), but whereas 'The Road' was all grays and desolation, deranged survivors who, after raping you would like to have you for a snack, 'On The Beach' was a Technicolor setting of polite citizens, tending their gardens, fishing, dancing and carrying on in the face of sure extinction with smiles on their faces and in all good graces.SPOILER ALERT!Like 'The Road', this post-nuclear war story does not give the details of the actual war and falling bombs with their crowning mushroom clouds. Instead it picks up after the war has ended and takes us Down Under to Aussie Land where we spend our last days with the last surviving remnants of the human race.Here is where I struggled with the story. We all know nuclear war is a scenario that could really happen. That's why these stories scare the hell out of people. but the way these survivors are portrayed is way out of the scope of reality in light of what the author has them facing. I could imagine a small handful of individuals handling the situation as these did, but not an entire community. At one point while reading I got a song stuck in my head and humorously imaged these characters in a club all smiling and dancing to the REM song 'It's The End Of The World As We Know It, And I Feel Fine'!Nope! No one would be feeling fine in this scenario, and so I have to give this a 3.5 rating; even though, as I said in the beginning, I would really like to give it a 5. And here's why.There are some things that come to the human mind that go beyond, frightening. For a species that possess a self awareness, a habit of seeking answers, and expecting to find them whenever we desire, it can be overwhelming, discomforting to the extreme, when faced with mysteries that personally affect us in which we discover that there are no answers. I think the only thing that stirs our curiosity more than the question of the Cosmo's is the meaning of life, or better yet, death.It's one thing for a particular individual, a cancer patient for example who has been given six months to live, to know the time of their death. But imagine the entirety of the last surviving group of human beings to know for a certainty that in six months they will all die. It's worse than being frightened. It's an emotion unacceptable to the human psyche-- hopelessness.Despite the unrealistic nature of the characters in this story, the idea presented and its culmination in this story was one of the most disturbing I have ever read. Knowing-- knowing they were all going to die and that there would be no survivors and that there was not a thing in the world they could do about it is a knowledge that would be as incomprehensible as trying to guess the limits of the universe. I could not imagine living, counting down the time, months, weeks days, and everyone discussing how they want to go out. Fight the sickness or take the pills being freely distributed that will allow the victim to go to a final sleep as opposed to a horrible end of suffering. Imagine being faced with the decision to inject your infant child, or let them go, knowing that if you die first they will suffer alone with no care at all.This story, despite the failings in character portrayal, is an extremely powerful dystopian tale and one I highly recommend. Actually, I wish that every world leader and person of authority in the military should be required to read 'On The Beach'. Maybe-- just maybe-- it might give someone pause before going into a button pushing frenzy.
