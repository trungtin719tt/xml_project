How do I write this to persuade the uninitiated how greatPeace Like a Riveris without seeming like a freak?A cursory glance at the synopsis should've had me running for the hills. At its core, its about good old-fashioned family values, faith (read: religion), and "miracles" (read: divine intervention). It also features Zane Grey/Louis L'amour-influenced epic poetry (as penned by a precocious 8 year-old), narration by an asthmatic 11 year-old, desperadoes and fugitives from the law like Butch Cassidy, Jesse James, and the Younger brothers. Meh. I don't like old-timey Westerns, I'm not much for precocious kids telling stories, and, well, as for the faith and miracles thing, this "Doubting Thomas" subscribes more to Jon Krakauer's school of thought:: "Faith is the very antithesis of reason".(And, yet, were I to put Goodreads to use as it was intended and "shelve" my favorites, you'd find no less than three novels in my Top Ten with faith/spirituality as a centerpiece: David James Duncan's sublimeThe Brothers KandThe River Whyand John Irving's simply transcendentA Prayer for Owen Meany. And, so, with the latest contender for a spot on my top ten, Leif Enger's stunner makes four novels with spirituality at their nexus. Go figure.)Peace Like a Riveris not exactly plot-heavy. (There's certainly a plot here, but it's one you'll want to drink in as the story and atmospherics envelop you). It's a story (set in the early 1960's in the cold, barren farmlands of Western Minnesota, and the even colder, even more barren Badlands of the Dakotas) of the Land family: narrator Reuben, an asthmatic fellow relaying the events of the book in retrospect; father Jeremiah, a mostly-ambitionless, schoolhouse janitor and ultra-pious disciple of God (and conduit to, or source of many of the aforementioned miracles); Reuben's younger sister Swede, whose poetry serves as parallel allegory to the actions of their older brother; and Davy, whose actions to defend his girlfriend and sister from a pair of thugs land him in jail...and worse.Indelible characters (particularly Ruben, Swede and Jeremiah, as iconic as Scout, Jem, and Atticus Finch inTo Kill a Mockingbird) unforgetable dialogue, vivid you-are-there scenery, and a story to keep you turning the pages till the wee hours (yet slow enough to savor every sentence) are all components of a near-masterpiece. I urge you all to give Enger's 2001 (!) novel (his first of only two penned) a read, no matter your receptivity to stories of spirituality and faith (and the Old West) It's a keeper.Highly recommended.
