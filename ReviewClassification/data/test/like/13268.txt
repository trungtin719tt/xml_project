4 starsWhoo! Finally! I finally finishedThe Reckoning! Again, I'm reminded of the memories of the time I enjoyed reading the Darkest Powers trilogy. And now that I finished re-reading them, I have nothing but bliss from reading them.So, The Reckoning. I'll be honest, it's been years since I last read the book and most of my memories of it were a bit shady. I remember the end, but the beginning and the middle were a blur to me. I thought there was a lot of action in the beginning, but apparently not. Not to say it was bad, but I was way off. Like, a lot. -_-Anyway, I enjoyed the book a lot like the previous books! This one took me less time to read since I wasn't that busy so I flew through it.Even though I liked it, my main issue with this, and I'm sure it was for a lot of people, was that the majority of the book took place in one spot. Which, listen, I'm okay if most books take place in a specific area, but I wished there was more. Luckily there was plot progression and secrets being uncovered that made it enjoyable.I won't go into full detail about the plot because it is the final book, but I'll say that it was a fun ride! The trilogy may not be for everyone, but if you ever want to read series, check them out!VerdictI'm so glad I decided to read the trilogy again! Next up, theDarkness Risingtrilogy! (That is until I finish my school work. Damn you college.)Thanks for reading my review!-Cesar
