Review of the audiobook narrated by Scott Brick.Mystic River is a satisfyingly complex police procedural with well developed characters and a gritty look at the seedy underbelly of Boston. I'm a hair's width away from giving it 5 stars, but am settling on 4 for now - let's say a pre-rounding 4.5 stars. I read and loved Shutter Island years ago (right before the movie came out) and have been wanting to read another Lehane book for a while now.This was a heavy book to listen to. Not so much dark or disturbing, but full of a steady stream of raw emotions. Anger, loss, love, fear, regret, hope - something at all times. Never dull. The characters are well developed, interesting and - you guessed it - full of emotion. I did question their motivations at times when they seemed to only be acting a certain way to advance the plot.The main theme is that of the loss of childhood innocence. We see the factors that make this more likely for some than for others (sometimes it just takes one choice), the lifelong impact on the individual and how it can also affect the lives of close family and friends. Lehane masterfully weaves this into the main plot of the book and it adds depth and realism to the characters.This is the fourth book I've listened to narrated by Scott Brick and I'm a little conflicted. Because he doesn't change the tone of his voice much (he does accents, but that's about it), he's best in books from a single perspective or with few characters. Large casts of characters are not his strong suit. This book is somewhere in the middle, with only a few perspectives, but many characters. I do really like his delivery though so I found it enjoyable as long as I was paying close attention to who was supposed to be talking.Final verdict: 4.5 star story, 4 star narration, 4 stars overall (on the fence about rounding down though)
