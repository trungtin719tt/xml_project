I read this when I was very young. Young enough that anything with a sexual connotation was interesting to me. Even really perverse deviations like this.A collector of butterflies 'collects' a girl and holds her prisoner. His deviation is far deeper than merely sex. But of course, sex is implied all the time.There are two sorts of kept women, those gold-diggers who actively sought it, and those trophy wives who had never planned for it and had been actively courted. This is a trophy wife by force, not a sex slave but a 'wife'.It's a very original story, writing at it's finest. And it's creepy, very very creepy.Thanks toLoederkoningin&gt; for inspiring me to write this review.There are a lot of excellent reviews on GR about this book, but in my opinion they all give far too much away. The book is like an onion. The outside skin, then the world within, layer upon layer. And at it's resolution, quite unexpectedly there is a tiny green shoot. Every detail you know about the story or the characters will take away a layer for you.5 star read, a gold five star.
