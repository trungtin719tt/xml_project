I'm giving this book five stars because I definitely thought it was amazing. BUT ... like every other Coelho book I've read, it let me down in the end.How can he articulate so many nuggets of wisdom, often through characters the writing of which expresses the irony and profundity of their insights, and yet packaged in stories with such cliche outcomes?!?! So many of his books explore the ephermerality of love, the moment, the permanence of change, the fleetingness of forever... and yet, his characters always seem to end up living "happily ever after."This one was about my favorite topic(s): sex, pain and suffering, pleasure, enthrallment, identity; the stories we tell ourselves about ourselves ("trust me, I'm telling you stories"), the rationalization of emotion and spiritualization of the mundane--Hey: the mystery of life.Maria--a prostitute--is exposed to an evening of sado-masochistic role play with a "special client" and finds freedom from herself and her desires during orgasm, tied up and whipped. Then another lover (another "special client") convinces her to not to go down that path, that freedom can be found testing the limits of desire, not the limits of pain. They have their own little role play--their relationship is based as much on fantasy as the other. After a night of bliss, she leaves him to go back to Brazil, cherishing the memory that can be spoiled by "real life."But, then he intercepts her in Paris with roses (it was their destiny! ick) and they live happily ever after.So, to sum up (as E just pointed out): The dirty parts I liked. The ending, not so much.That's my review. Happy reading.
