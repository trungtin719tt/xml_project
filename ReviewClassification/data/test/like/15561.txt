1 Million Bibles are sold every week.....4.7 billion sold....no other book comes anywhere near that record!It is unique.I find it strange that some say, 'I don't believe the Bible' that's like saying 'I don't believe History'...go to the British Museum and see for yourself all the artifacts and the Biblical references to the places mentioned in the Bible.So many lovers ofWilliam Shakespearedo not seem to be aware of the fact that the Bard took part in translating the King Jame's Version of the Bible into English.Like a bit of proof? On Shakespeare's 46th birthday he translated Psalm 46....count 46 words from the beginning of the Psalm and 46 words from the end.....he did it to put his personal mark on this translation!As for the recommendations in the Bible.....yeah I think its great to love our neighbour as ourself....I think to put others first.....instead of this Age of the Ego, this Age of Me-ism....is wonderful....imagine that....no war, no violence, no abuse, no stealing.....what was it John Lennon wrote about in 'Imagine'?
