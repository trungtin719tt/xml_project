easily one of the best books i've ever read in my life. just completely floored me. i don't give a shit about history, war, america, the military... i don't care about any of this stuff. like, at all. but this book was amazing. i just cried the whole way through. for every single character. even the ones who lived. especially the ones who lived.this was like aBleak House,A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,The Book of Ebenezer Le Pagetype situation. i forget books can be this good.
