This Thos. Hardy novel will either break your heart or leave you cold. As someone from a disadvantaged region with an inferior secondary education, I identified strongly with young Jude Fawley, his dreams and aspirations, and his cross to bear: despite plenty of smarts and initiative, late 19th-Century England would deny him educational opportunities because he lacked "background." Not as much romance in this 1894 novel as in most Hardy works, and it certainly can get rugged at times, but the same can be said of THE MAYOR OF CASTERBRIDGE. JUDE, I firmly believe, is one of Hardy's best.
