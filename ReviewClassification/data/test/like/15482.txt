Well written &amp; so plausible that it's scary, it's also survived the test of time very well. Written over 50 years ago in 1957 by engineer Nevel Shute Norman, an engineer who owned a firm that made secret stuff for the British government, it amazed me by how the politics &amp; cause of the war are still so possible.The book follows about 6 people for the last 6 months of their lives. There is no explicit sex or violence. The northern hemisphere has been turned into a radioactive wasteland &amp; the radioactivity is slowly moving south. Australia has about 6 months to live &amp; they know it. They keep their civilization going. No 'Mad Max' scenarios. Just law abiding folks who know the end is coming.It's fantastic &amp; horrifying &amp; depressing, but also neat on several levels. Shute shows us people at their very best after the very worst has happened. The coping mechanisms they use &amp; the little problems they have &amp; overcome. it's quite a fantastic journey &amp; well worth the time to read.I've never seen either film made from the book &amp; don't think I care to since they screwed up the endings according to Wikipedia.
