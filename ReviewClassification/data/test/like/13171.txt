Bravo Palahniuk, Bra-ha-vo!Man am I late to the Palahniuk party, geez. This book was amazing, his writing impeccable. The man can weave sentences in ways very few can. I agree this man's writing should be taught in philosophy courses. To review a book that's starts with this:"If you're going to read this, don't bother.After a couple pages, you won't want to be here. So forget it. Go away. Get out while you're still in one piece. Save yourself....What happens here is first going to piss you off. After that it just gets worse and worse."I mean how do you do that? The first chapter just grabbed me, it really beats on the "little cooz" boy and makes you really feel for him, Victor Mancini, the star of the story, if you could even call him that. Victor, the "stupid stupid little boy" AKA the hero maker. I mean have you ever heard of someone going to restaurants and purposely choking on food so someone could save them and then play off of their personally remarkable experience by hitting them up for money to help support himself and pay for his mother's medical bills? Crazy!As many people have stated this book is not for everyone. It just isn't, and I can tell that by the many bad reviews it has gotten. To them I shake my head, I LOVED IT! It is definitely an acquired taste though and there is a select group out there that this book is spot on for. This book you will find addictions galore, sex, death, religion, pain, profanity, blasphemy, and much literary repetition that could drive the avid reader or English major wonky. Definitely a good introduction to Palahniuk."Masterpiece" isn't the right word, but it's the first word that comes to mind.See also: ProfoundSee also: Unique
