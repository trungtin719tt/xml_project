Never give up the fight, and that even when there seems no way out the way of the warrior, win or lose, is the correct way.Books are such a wonderful thing that it teaches you all and me being very curious, we have become best friends now.This was one of the best autobiographies I have ever read. The determination of papillon is beyond explanation. The tattoo on his chest of a papillon really meant something, he was never meant to be caged. An awesome journey, many things to learn from and will always remember him when I feel down as how he never gave up. A great read!
