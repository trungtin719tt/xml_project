I have read this book several times over the years, but it has been a while since the last time I read it.One of the things that amazes me about Koontz is his ability to create characters that pull you into the story and root for them. The main characters, Travis and Nora, overcome difficulty early on in the book and it is clear that Koontz wants us to be on their side. Additionally, there is the absolutely pure character of Einstein (the Golden Retriever) who it is nearly impossible NOT to like. But buried deep in this book Koontz gives the reader an interesting choice. He presents two very different portraits of evil and allows the reader to decide for themselves what the true definition of evil is. I felt challenged to examine the concept of inherently good vs. inherently evil and while Koontz appears to give easy answers to these questions, the characters representing these differing ideas made it clear that there are no absolutes.As with many of Koontz's books I find this story satisfying on many different levels. It may not be War and Peace, but it certainly is enjoyable. Come to think of it, War and Peace isn't enjoyable at all, so really in many ways it is better than War and Peace. But more importantly, I don't feel like punching myself in the face for wasting a day reading it. (I still haven't forgiven you Dan Brown.)
