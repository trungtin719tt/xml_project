This book was SO GOOD! I really really enjoyed it!The world building wasn't super solid - I think that was my main and only issue, but the rest was so great. It's hard to compete with PJO and HOO, but this is still such a great book from Riordan. I also appreciate that though it's still about mythical gods, it's not an exact copy of what PJO is. It's super different and stands on its own as a really unique and interesting story.I love Carter and Sadie and I'm really excited to read the rest of the trilogy! GONNA BE FUN!
