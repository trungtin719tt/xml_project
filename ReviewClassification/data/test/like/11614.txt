What a great classic horror story! It just may be one of the best, because of the year she wrote this booktruly makes it unique and a precursor of all or most of the haunted house stories to be written thereafter.The movie The Haunting old b&amp;w based on this story is excellent and truly scary and creepy especially for that eraand so eerie and suspenseful and no blood and gore just an old fashioned scare the wits out of you haunted house story!
