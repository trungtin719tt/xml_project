Best romantic YA book of 2010! Simone Elkeles delivered again, with another rebellious, gorgeous and intelligent Fuentes brother stealing our hearts.SPOILER ALERT!!! In this second installment of three in the "Perfect Chemistry" YA series, our favorite struggling couple, Alejandro "Alex" Fuentes and Brittany Ellis are back and are now 20 years old and still attending college in Colorado. A minor character in the first book now takes center stage - middle brother Carlos Fuentes, being sent back to the United States from Mexico by his mother and uncle to give him a chance to escape a life of crime and gangs.In Fuentes style, Carlos immediately makes it clear to big brother Alex and saintly Brittany that he doesn't need them or their sympathy and help, and that he would rather be in Chicago or back in Mexico than see his complacent, do-gooder brother continue on the path of higher learning and a better life. Of course, Carlos doesn't have a choice in the matter, and begins high school immediately, where he meets Kiara, the daughter of Alex's professor. Kiara is a nature girl who gets high on walking, hiking, jogging and any physical activity that keeps her happy and healthy. Add to this, she has two idealistic and organic parents, and one nifty little brother - enough to make Carlos want to gag. Needless to say, Kiara and Carlos don't hit it off, despite poor Kiara's best efforts to be his school buddy his first week in classes. Carlos is soon lured back into bad habits by the disgustingly beautiful Madison, a girl who is nothing but trouble. No sooner than Carlos decides not to take up Madison's offers of her body, Carlos finds himself framed for possession of drugs at school. Before all else is lost and Carlos is headed for prison, in walks Kiara's family to the rescue, offering to take Carlos into their home and rehabilitate him."Rules of Attraction" follows a similar pattern of awkward friendship just like Alex and Brittany, but Kiara and Carlos blaze their own trail on the path to true love. Carlos finds and excellent father figure in Professor Westford, a man with his own shady past who has a beautiful family and a great career in academia. Although Carlos rails against the goodness of a family who don't know him but embrace him anyway, he begins to slowly make personal changes, and takes notice of Kiara. Kiara who is true to herself, has her own problems, namely battling with a stuttering problem, being dumped by her jerk of a boyfriend by text, not having any girlfriends to speak of, never has been to a high school dance, and gets picked on at school by the likes of the snobby Madison.Kiara and Carlos through witty banter, close-up fights, and moments of closeness begin to understand each other better. The romantic scenes are tastefully done, and Elkeles makes sure the message of safe sex is there without hitting you over the head. Never too far away from Carlos' thoughts are his mother and little brother, and his longing for his country that is rife with the crippling problems of the drug trade. Carlos never dismisses his heritage, and his love for Mexico comes through in his shopping and cooking, sharing his culture with the Westfords through dinner. Carlos never denies his Latino heritage, but there is room in his heart for a girl from a vastly different background and color, and you can't help but root for them to find a way to be together forever, much like Alex and Brittany. I highly recommend this book for teenagers, grades 8 and up, especially for Simone Elkeles fans, and for teens looking for an intelligent romance book with enough humor and drama, and a realistic interracial couple that do get their happy ending. Another smash hit for Simone Elkeles!
