This book has been chosen for a discussion in the21st Century Literaturegroup that starts next week. I am not normally interested in dystopian fantasy novels but the last two Atwood books I read (The Blind AssassinandAlias Grace) were so good that I thought I should give it a chance.For me this is a very difficult book to judge, as throughout the book my reactions were oscillating between picking holes in the science (and it is always dangerous reading any predictions once a few years have elapsed) and being impressed with the power and completeness of Atwood's imaginative vision, however bleak her judgment of modern humanity.The book is told from the perspective of the self-styled (Abominable) Snowman, who believes he may be the last human survivor and is entrusted with looking after a group of weirdly childish and innocent mutants he dubs Crakers, and defending them from various genetically engineered hybrid predators. The sections alternate between the present and his memories of his life before the catastrophe, when he was the childhood friends with the megalomaniac genetic scientist known as Crake, who has both engineered the disease that has wiped out the rest of humanity, and masterminded the development of the mutant children. The Crakers have been genetically programmed to remove humanity's most destructive features and to adapt to their degraded environment. There are obvious parallels with Biblical stories, particularly the Garden of Eden, but overall Atwood's vision is a relentlessly bleak one.The book is quite an easy and compulsive read, but I am not sure it left me wanting to read the rest of the trilogy.
