A fascinating, impeccably researched, and beautifully written account of Gavrilo Princip. By retracing his journey from a small, impoverished village in Bosnia to a street in Sarajevo where he shot dead Archduke Franz Ferdinand, Butcher manages to recreate not only the man but the broader history that enabled two world wars and the bloody conflict in Bosnia. It is a far reaching and unflinching look at the instincts--noble and base--that drive our species.
