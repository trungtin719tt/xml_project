I wasn't sure if I was going to give it 4 or 5 stars, because this book is very good, but it does has one mayor flaw that I found to be annoying.Meghan and Ash. When you think about it... What does she really know about him, besides that he's gorgeous and 'icy'? He tried to kill her several times now. I don't know but that doesn't exactly scream boyfriend material to me.Don't get me wrong, I nearly creamed myself when I read he has a silver stud in his ear. Add the billowing coat and I'm sold. But having those kind of feelings for somebody who is still a stranger smells a little too much like Bella &amp; Edward to me.To give you an idea of how bad it was sometimes... I'm into romance and I go aaaawwww and OMG! every time a guy in a book does something even remotely cute/sweet/romantic. But there was a part where I laughed out loud; This was me being very inappropriate. Like laughing at a funeral inappropriate. I won't give away any details, but there is a scene where Ash is standing there while Meghan and her entourage are running through a door. When Meghan looks back, the door is falling shut and she sees Ash standing there with (I forgot the exact wording) a trace of a single tear frozen to his cheek. I think even Ironhorse would have hidden under the bed when he heard me laughing. It was alittlebit too much. I know, I'm horrible. It should have been pretty and amazing and all... To me it was just cheesy, over the top and hilarious. But! *very serious face* The situation was very very grim and I did feel sad about what was happening. But that specific part... Nah. It didn't work for me.However, I like Ash a lot and I also liked the way this book ended, even if it was pretty predictable. (yes, I'm a very complicated creature)I adore Ironhorse. I liked him in The Iron King (when he speaks, his voice booms in my head, I love it) and now he's one of my favorite characters in The Iron Daughther. Grim still takes the lead though ^^.
