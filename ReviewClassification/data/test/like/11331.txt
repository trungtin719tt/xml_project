Pure gold in humor! 4 unforgettable characters: Stephanie Plum, Joe Morelli, Ranger and Grandma Mazur. Let's do a lil' recap:Stephanie: Your everyday girl... with great humor, a bit of sass, lots of determination and an inability to know her limits. But each and every time you root for her to win!Joe: Honest. Smart. Good-looking. Apparently great in bed. Knows his food. Wants to make Stephanie happy. But knows his limits.Ranger: Everyone's secret freebie. Apparently a god. Attitude that won't quit but turns you on at the same time. Always finds you just in time, that is, before you get yourself into too much trouble.Grandma: OMG, can you be any funnier? She has a gun. And she shoots it often. But she's whacked out most of the time. I NEED to meet her.So... 20-something books to go in the series, but this first one will hook you right away. I need to keep on reading.
