I had picked up and put down this book so many times, trying, without success, to make it through the first 100 pages. It was only until a co-worker and i decided to form a "one-off" book club in order to read it before a theater adaptation by a local company that i made any real progress. even with a clearly defined reason in hand, the first 100 pages can be taxing; it's best to read slowly, savoring the flavor of the words even if you can't quite grasp all the meanings. however, hang on because somewhere around page 120 the whole book suddenly opens up and the story just -clicks- into place. i like to think of it as the sunshine finally breaking through the seemingly impenetrable grey, Oregon rain clouds. Once that shift occurred it was hard to put this book down. the prose became easier, the side stories made more sense, and the characters had such a grip on me. i absolutely loved this book and am looking forward to reading it again and again in the future.
