I'm always so torn when it comes to Nicholas Sparks books. Especially with this book because I was really torn between 3 or 4 stars.The Guardianwas a pretty good story about finding a new love after an unexpected death. Julie was left two things after his untimely death: a puppy and a promise. After mourning for a handful of years, Julie has decided it's time to dip her toes into the love pool again. One day she meets Richard and there's an instant attraction. After a couple of dates, Richard believes he loves her. Meanwhile. Julie is seeing this other guy named Mike.Unfortunately things aren't all happy go lucky for Julie. Once she turns down Richard because she is with Mike, who is one of her late husband's best friends.. well, let's just say that he doesn't handle it well. I mean, no one handles rejection well.. but damn, this guy was crazy.Richard was probably a great villain because he was one creepy dude. He made me cringe so many times.. I loved it! He would call her all the time and just hang up.. it reminded me of like middle school or maybe even elementary school. When you would get with your friends and prank call you crush but instead of saying anything just hang up.Overall, this book was good. I don't really know why I was so hesitant about the star rating.. but then again I'm weird.
