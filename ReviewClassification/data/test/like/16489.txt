I'm crazy for books about people surviving against the odds. (Just saw Redford's new movie. Great.) So of course, I had to read this one. Plus it's by one of my favorite writers. This one was especially fun because the woman could barely make it in suburbia, what was she going to do in a desert full of creepy crawly things? Molly Brock is now my hero.
