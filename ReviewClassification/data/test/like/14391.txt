I am not normally a fan of evangelical novels, but "Christy" is an exception. The titular heroine is an idealistic young girl in the 19th century who finds herself moved to volunteer as a teacher in an impoverished Appalachian town. Christy struggles to understand her pupils, their insular mountain culture, and ultimately her own faith and what it means to her. Unlike many evangelical novels, faith is not the character's sole concern: Christy spends plenty of time worrying about how to get new books for her students, how to afford that beautiful black hat on a teacher's salary, and how to choose between the handsome minister and the gruff Scottish doctor who both appear to be courting her. Disease, death, weddings, moonshine whisky, and lethal clan feuds all have their place, painting a marvelous portrait of the vivid Appalachian culture.
