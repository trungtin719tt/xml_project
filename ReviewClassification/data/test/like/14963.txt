Where the magic happenshttp://toughcriticbookreviews.blogspo...Ever since I read Tammara Weber's Between the Lines series I have been obsessively counting down the days, the hours, the minutes, the teeny tiny nanoseconds until her next release. I was beyond intrigued with her writing style inBetween the Linesand even though I was a little indifferent (the story just wasn't for me, but her writing was absolutely phenom--wait for it...enal) I wanted more, I craved more and reading between the lines of her first few books (kick ass pun, I know) I new greatness was on the way; I needed more. More! More! MORE!! I knew her future books would be completely smothered in greatness sauce and sweet baby Jesus that future is here. That future is NOW!Easystarts off with a colossal mind shattering BANG! There's no verbose introduction or ad nauseam plot setup; no typical "it took me a few chapters to get into the story" reaction. The story will get into YOU! The first few pages will grab you and never let go.After the intro heard round the world, the plot took a turn that came extremely close to ruining my book buzz. I assumed I had the plot all figured out; I assumed the "thing" I figured out would be annoyingly dragged out throughout the entire book. I assumed! I assumed! I ASSUMED!! Well, you know what they say about people who assume...I'M AN ASS!!!! Tammara Webber makes you think you know what's going on until you don't! I've never been more relieved to be wrong in my entire life!Yes there's language, yes there's drinking, and OH MY GOODNESS yes there are sexual situations. You spend a great amount of time (sweet agonizing time) waiting for Lucas and Jacqueline to um..."connect". However, the wait is made bearable by a lot of "foreconnecting"! It's steamy Divinyls hot! It'll drive you absolutely wild! My one and only complaint was after all the toe curling "foreconnecting", the actual "connecting" was a little disappointing. The climax was a little anticlimactic (*giggle* and puntastic).Greatness knocked and Tammara Webber answered and the answer wasEasy. Easy to fall in love with the characters, easy to get hooked on an amazing plot, easy to agonize over the fact there was only 10 pages left, and easy to be left wanting more! And that's exactly what I want from Tammara Webber, MORE!
