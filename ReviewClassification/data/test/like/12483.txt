[reread] 01.29.18: added another star this time roundMy penultimate Jane Austen novel.(nooooooo!)For me, it took too long to get going. Not until they arrived in London that I started to get curious about how the story will unfold and what will happen to the Dashwood sisters. Elinor, I liked well enough but I found Marianne to be too self-righteous and annoying. She did turn a new leaf in the end but I think it came too late for me to start liking her at that point.Owning to the fact that because ofHER,I had to deal with a selfish man namedWilloughby.And even after I thought I was in the clear, had tosuffer through hislong arse, asinine speechof how hepitied himself(view spoiler)[for having to give Marianne up in order to marry hisvery wealthy wife...(hide spoiler)]ARE YOU KIDDING ME?Insufferable man!Get lost already!I'm afraid I was not partial to any of the men in this. Can you tell? Ha!The only one with Y chromosome who was a bit interesting was Colonel Brandonbut he had such a small role in the book. I wish we could see more of him! Even Mr. Palmer was entertaining to read about. As for the rest, I hated Willoughby (yes, needed to be point out again) and Edward was... well, he was kind of boring.All these main characters in this book made me appreciate, probablyfor the first time,the 'mouthy' characters in Austen novels. I know, I know, I'm shocked myself. I never endeared myself to any of them before. Although I was real close to do that for Miss Bates in Emma but ended up didn't - she was okay but that was all.Here, I loved it whenever Mrs. Jennings and Charlotte/Mrs. Palmer were in the scene.Delightful in contrastof several insipid, stoic characters.
