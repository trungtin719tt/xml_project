This is a wonderful little novel about the internal conflicts of the modern man. Selfishness masquerading as selflessness. Our admiration of freedom, yet our inclination towards slavery. Our critique of the living, and honoring of the dead. admitting guilt, not for repentance, but to make guilty of others, so as to make oneselves, in turn, less guiltyThe fall recounts a man's fall from innocence, to hating all that is mankind, with all it's contradictions, wishing some form of master would float out of the heavens and just tell him what to do. The contradictions that bother the narrator so much, are the exact contradictions that he is manifesting through his own speech, therefore causing him to hate himself. Is that not the final, greatest contradiction of all?It is impossible to read this novel without drawing parallells to Dostoevsky, particularly Notes From Underground. The unreliable narration, the contradictiory Speech, the half-truths, and most of all, the "preachy" (not that that is a bad thing at all) nature of the characters.The discoveries in this novel are simple yet profound, endlessly quotable, and will probably have to be read on several occasions to truly digest it all.
