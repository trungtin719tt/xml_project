Well, to all the readers who are baffled by the 'opinions' and 'interpretations' of the authors here, who are supposedly the translators with a 'Rudimental' knowledge of the original language in which the text is present, please read The Bhagavad Gita by the Indian sages and authors who were (and are) well-versed in Sanskrit. I would recommend the one by Sri Paramhansa Yogananda or by A C Bhaktivedanta. You will, then only, revel in the full knowledge and the depth.And to some of the 'readers' who are deeming this book as some holy text or limiting it to one religion, Hinduism, please, let me know where the world Hinduism is mentioned in this work. The Bhagavad Gita is for all - Sri Krishna loves all - those who love him are loved and those who don't love him are loved equally - he is, was and will be. We are, have been and shall be. Nothing ends - nothing begins. Sri Krishna is nothing and everything!
