It's hard to know where to begin - the back of my edition proclaims, "The earthy, torrid story of a lusty, yelling, Paul Bunyan of a man and his battles with society." (In fact, it proclaims that all in caps.) That sort of describes an aspect of the book, but mostly it's kind of like those ads for action movies where they play up the love story angle to try to get the women to come and see it - you know how they cut together the 5 minutes of time actually devoted to the supposed love story and then have a voiceover of something like, "a love that wouldn't be denied"? Like that.Okay, let me back up and explain a little about the bones of the book. It's about the Stamper family, who came west to Oregon sometime around the turn of the 20th century. We get to know Henry, the patriarch of the family, who came to Oregon and found his occupation logging and trying to "whup" the land. He has two sons: Hank, by his first wife, and Leland Stanford by his second. The second wife eventually leaves him (she was from the east and not the kind of woman cut out for living in a shack on the shore of a river in the middle of nowhere Oregon), taking young Lee with her. Lee leaves with not much feeling at all about his father, but a hatred for Hank because Hank has been carrying on an affair with Lee's mother. Years later, Lee is a college student in New York when he receives a postcard from his family in Oregon requesting that he come back and help out with the family business. Lee comes back, much to everyone's surprise, but he returns with complex motivations.He gets to know his family - irascible Henry; his cousin Joe Ben, who is the self-appointed ray of sunshine; Viv, Hank's wife; and of course brother Hank, who Lee immediately sets about sizing up and deciding how best to take his revenge on. Against this backdrop is the drama the family is embroiled in with the town, involving a loggers' strike and a deal the Stampers have made with a lumber company. A multitude of themes are at work in the book - what family means, loyalty, the need for every man to prove himself, whether any man can truly be an island, revenge and its price, the lines between love, obsession, and duty, strength and weakness and what defines each are just a few.The writing style is a little confusing at times - Kesey employs a few tactics that can be difficult to follow at first. In order to cover several viewpoints, he will jump between scenes of what different characters are doing and saying at any given moment in time. He uses parenthetical or italicized text to give a character's thoughts on whatever is going on. He also switches from third-person to first-person narration at the drop of a hat, and the first-person narration is not always by the same person, even within the course of a few paragraphs. These techniques can definitely be hard on the reader, but they're very effective once you get into the rhythm of it.I really loved this one. Recommended for: people who like stories about the wilderness and man's relationship with it, people with daddy issues, people with mommy issues, people with brother issues, lumberjacks, and people who like to read descriptions of rain.Quote:"This is an insidious malady chiefly common in that mythical organ that pumps life through the veins of the ego: care, coronary care, complicated by galloping fear. The go-away-closer disease. Starving for contact and calling it poison when it is offered.... Never accept candy from strangers. Or from friends. Sneak off a sack of gumdrops when nobody's looking if you can, but don't accept, never accept ... you want somebody taking advantage? And above all, never care, never never *never* care. Because it is caring that lulls you into letting down your guard and leaving up your shades...."
