First Read December 2010 : 3 starsSecond Read November 2014 : 3.5 starsWeird. Before this series re-read, I didn't expect to like Butch's book less than I did the first time, and V's book more than I did before. That turned out to be a complete switcheroo. I didn't end up down-rating Butch's book, but I decided to raise my rating on V's. I think I was so annoyed with Jane's "solution" in this book the first time I read it, that it hampered my enjoyment of the outcome. Now that I've gotten used to how everything turned out (since I've read the entire series), it doesn't bother me as much now as it did back then.As for the series re-read overall : this is still the same guilty pleasure cheesiness that people either love or hate. BDB is comfort food to me - it may be fatty and serve no "healthy" purpose, but it's fun and satisfying nonetheless, as long as I learn to laugh over the ridiculousness and not take it too seriously. It's kind of fun to be reading an "old familiar" set of books at the moment and not having to worry about reviewing every single one of them. I just threw a note in with this book since I hadn't reviewed it before.
