A pre-Harry Potter young adult series that was a guilty pleasure for me at age 26 to be reading in public. But I couldn't put it down. L.J. Smiths characters were a little flat, yes. Her settings felt 2 dimensional to me and I often couldn't get a grasp of what exactly the characters were really like as people, sure. But that doesn't mean the story wasn't spot on! Once I ignored the flaws in Smiths construction of her Sunnydale-esq town with it's Vampire drama lurking in the shadows of a popularity battle between 2 high school girls, I became addicted. I literally couldn't put the book down. I just couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next.Vampire Diaries reads like a CW teen drama. In a good way! Which made me wonder why this hasn't already been adapted to film or TV yet.Forget that other, hallow, vapid vampire series-Thisis the Girl-meets-Vampire story to read. Same plot- only L.J. Smith does it better!
