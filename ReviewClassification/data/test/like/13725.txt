I can't even remember how many times I have read this book over the years &amp; every time it has a profound effect on me. Strangely(this probably won't come as a surprise to those who have been effected by this book), just yesterday I saw my tattered copy of this book on a long ignored book self. I saw it - my heart skipped a beat, I grinned widely and went about my business. Today, I come across - quite by accident, I might add - reviews here on Goodreads. To me that is a knock on the head kind of nudge that I can't ignore!Illusions means different things to different people and as a born again Christian I know I am in the minority and will no doubt shock 'my kind'. That's all right with me though - my Messiah shocked people all the time!
