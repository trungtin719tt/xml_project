Titular Zorba is Don Quixote &amp; Sancho Panza both. An idiot savant, &amp; yet damn if wisdom doesn't occasionally spurt out of that mega-mustachioed mouth. Un-P.C. &amp; misogynist to the extreme, he belongs in the annals of literature-- the creation that in itself is all the plot that the novel requires, since it does not have one to begin with. Interest throughout this ebbs &amp; flows like the Meditarranean sea along its coast.
