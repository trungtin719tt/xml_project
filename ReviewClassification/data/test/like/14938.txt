I cottoned onto the Southern Vampire Series because I saw the "True Blood" ad campaign by HBO. It markets a synthetic blood beverage, so natch, I was intrigued. Basically, I was led to this series which features a telepathic heroine by the name of Sookie Stackhouse. For whatever reason, I thought this was a young adult series (it is SO not, btw) and on shallow reflection, I think it's because of her name: Sookie. I mean c'mon. It sounds like a sound you make to call pigs to you. However, other than her weird name and some pretty bad editing, this series, thus far, is just good plain, slightly porno, FUN!In a nutshell you have a 20-something virginal blond telepathic waitressing in rural Louisiana who hooks up with a sexy vampire. Trouble abounds in their relationship, and in the town, and complications arise due to the affections of another, more powerful vampire, a Werewolf, a nasty coven of Witches and two shape shifters. Our heroine goes from being perceived as being a freak of nature by her fellow humans to a truly hot commodity within the supernatural world. I find Sookie's struggle to deal with these attentions endearing.It would have been so easy for the author, Charlaine Harris, to add a serious subtext to this series with the emergence of Vampires into human society and their struggle to mainstream as a metaphor for racism and the battle for civil rights. However, this story is told from Sookie's perspective and Sookie is a pretty simple, straight forward gal who just doesn't delve into murky socio-political territories. You could argue that Harris is taking the easy way but I'll just call it consistent characterization. Maybe Harris herself doesn't bother herself with such thoughts but why hold it against her? Not every book has to be a deep examination of the human experience.I'll tell you what this book is though: a lively creation of an alternate reality where creatures humans always assumed were fabricated nightmares, have essentially "come out of the coffin." But Harris doesn't limit herself to vampires and I give her a lot of credit for that. She plays with other mythological beings and crafts these really fun murder mysteries set in the Deep South and throws in some steamy love scenes all the while. (Is it considered necrophilia if you do It with a vampire? Just wondering.) It's been a long time since I've had so much fun reading a story like this.
