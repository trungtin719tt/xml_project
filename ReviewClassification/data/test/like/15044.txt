I love this book! A djinn with an attitude (who had me constantly chuckling to myself), and a boy bent on revenge. Great characters, fast-paced action, fully-realized world with a cool magic system, what more could you want?What I appreciate most, though, is that the characters face real danger. None of that false suspense -- you know, like the ones you see on movies/television likePrison Break. Apologies for the fans, but it really irked me whenever Michael Scofield is in the tunnel and the guard is approaching his cell to check on the prisoners and it seems like Michael is gonna get caught, but then he miraculously materialized under his blanket!Well, you won't find any of that nonsense here! In this book, when you do something dangerous, you're gonna face the consequences. This, of course, open doors to deliciously unexpected plot twists that keeps you reading until the dead of night.Bought from Amazon, 14 Nov 07
