June 2010- if derek and chloe do not get together in this book, i think i just might die. really.September 2012- I'm always so disappointed when I finish this series. Like, "But... what do you mean it's over? We were just getting into some major character development..." disappointed.I almost wish this series was turned into a tv show just because I like the characters so much.
