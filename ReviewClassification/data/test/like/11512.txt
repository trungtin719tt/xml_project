Finally finished the sixth book in the Outlander series. It took me over a year to read not because it wasn't an enjoyable read, it was, but in typical Gabaldon style it was a saga of a book. One that I found I could leave and come back to. Which I did for a while until I got close to the end and then realised I just had to finish it. Now I'm feeling a little forlorn that I won't have this to keep me company but thankfully there are two more in the series to read and so I have book 7 waiting for me. I don't need to say too much more about how wonderful these books are and how awesome the characters are. Those who read them know and those who don't....well in my opinion you are missing out. Do yourselves a favour and immerse yourselves in the lives of Claire and Jamie.
