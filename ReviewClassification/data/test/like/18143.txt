A time travelling, sword swinging, science laden, probability speaking, historically interesting, magnificent tale!Even though Crichton is a popular author, I think he's underrated. At least that's what I think in the two books I've read (the other being Jurassic Park). I must read more of his work. Anybody got any suggestions?The format of this book is perfect. The way each chapter ended with a cliff hanger reminded me of George R.R. Martin. It creates something that you just don't want to put down.Absolute class! Any fans of suspense, time travel or just thrillers in general need to read this. Five well earned stars.
