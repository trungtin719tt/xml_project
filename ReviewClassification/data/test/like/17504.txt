Reading the title of this memoir, one might think it bears a heavier reliance on religious practices, and chronicles adherence for success in life. The title, however, is more a response to the overwhelming challenge recounted in this author's experience, and ultimately an answer. Ms. Nikolov describes in excruciating, (occasionally unnecessarily so) detail the experiences of living in a home fraught with the horrors of physical abuse and extreme sexual violence levied by both parents, apparently in cahoots. The story continues, displaying the permanent destruction brought about in the author's life by this dark start to her life, through drug and alcohol addiction, prostitution, and depression. It struggles in part with too many details about family issues which the reader gets at the beginning, as well as a slow resolution to the story. However, the author presents a unique twist just as it seems the story is ending, involving new horror, but this time involving another family member demonstrating the generational affects of abuse and assault on one's children. It culminates with a positive outlook and hope for the future. Ms. Nikolov displays a strong character, for adult readers, but not recommended for younger readers.
