I remember going to B&amp;N and seeing this series all the time. I bought Twilight(guilty), among other books, and those books just wouldn't budge from the same shelf as the rest of the supernatural. I decided to give them a try to see what all the fuss was about. The whole never tell a human about you or fall in love with them thing is kinda cool and cheesy. Read the books about 4 years ago and re read them this year just to remember marvelous Ash. He is who kept me going through the series more and more. His character is just so arrogant and mysterious as to his past actions. Love the series. All 9 short books of them. Great job, L. J. Smith.-------------------------------------------------------2016. Still good.
