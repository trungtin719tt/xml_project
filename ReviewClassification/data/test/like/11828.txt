If you want to get to know Campbell's ideas, there are better works - especially "Hero with a Thousand Faces" and the four-volume "Masks of God" - to read, but this series of interviews, which one can also watch on video, remains a good introduction to his worldview and approach, and had a big impact on me when I first encountered it in my 20s. The psychological approach to myth can hardly be called "traditional" in the Guenonian/Evolian sense but it remains a useful one nonetheless, since it can be a gateway to understanding its higher dimensions.
