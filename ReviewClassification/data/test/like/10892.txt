2018 Subjects Specific Reading ChallengeI have 30 books with specific subjects that I need to readBook 16:A book by two or more authorsStephen King and Peter StraubMagical adventureFirst Sentence:On September 15th, 1981, a boy named Jack Sawyer stood where the water and land come together, hands in the pockets of his jeans, looking out at the steady Atlantic.Having readThe Adventures of Tom SawyerandThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnjust recently; it is easy to see what have sparked the idea ofJack Sawyerin the minds ofKingandStraub.The Talismanis a combination of the original"Tom Sawyer Adventure"and the all known"King Horror".I haven't read any books byStraub, but I'm planning on getting my hands on them very soon.Even though this book felt liked it dragged on in places, and the pacing felt odd; looking back now I see how artful and masterful the weaving of story was setup.The places this book took me to, the emotions it awoke in me - it is the work of master storytellers!At first I thought of going straight to the next bookBlack House; but then discovered there is graphic novels. So undoubtedly I will be reading them first.
