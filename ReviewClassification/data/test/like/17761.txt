One of the best "make lemonade out of lemons" books I've read. Warm, witty, real.Told by Noel Strachan, an aging solicitor who is the trustee of Jean's estate, this story unfolds quietly.Jean is a strong, delightful woman; just the sort needed in the development of a section of Queensland, Australia that was left as a ghost town after the gold rush ended.Although a story of love and connectivity, this isn't a sappy love story. It's a solidly told story of a determined man &amp; woman who want to forge a life together and how they did it.I'd love a wallaby as a semi-pet, too. The descriptions of homestead life in Queensland is lonely but also very lovely.
