This is the book that started it all for me. I've always loved reading, but this is one of the first books I can really remember absolutely devouring. I believe the series isn't what it used to be after 100+ books, but this first arc and the journey we go on with Fireheart will always remain one of my favorites. I've read it countless times and never get tired of it.This book is the very first in the Warriors series by Erin Hunter. In a forest four clans of wild cats live in constant turmoil. This book focuses on ThunderClan, and an apprentice named Firepaw who joins that clan.
