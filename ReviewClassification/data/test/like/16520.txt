We are in Mississippi, in Jefferson, imaginary Yoknapatawpha County town where Faulkner located many of his novels. It is between the two world wars with a racist south, still recovering from the civil war.Lena, pregnant girl, comes from Alabama to join the father of the child. A house is on fire. A murder has been committed. We will then follow the fate of Joe Christmas, and parallel those of the Reverend Hightower and Joanna Burden.It is a very dense book. The atmosphere is heavy. Nothing is trivial. Each character has an unfortunate fate, tragic view. Faulkner describes much suffering among his characters mired in religion, in racism and hatred.This atmosphere is served by a beautiful writing, poetic and sensual. A writing that severe in us the feelings it evokes. Faulkner place his story in a nonlinear way. What I sometimes lost. But I remained glued to the story, even if the reading had to be in small doses, for all the reasons mentioned above. And I think he will stay me something of that reading for a long time.I will continue the discovery of this author, although I'll let a little time to immerse myself in this reading so rich and deep.
