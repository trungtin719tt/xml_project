(I'm too busy to do a plot summary and there are already so many out there so here is my very biased review)I really loved the experience of listening to this book. Engaging narration (by Kevin Freed and Katherine Kellgren) on the audiobook and I've always been a bit infatuated with Egyptian mythology. For me, this book was more enjoyable than the Percy Jackson series. It felt a little more mature (closer to YA), a little more "timeless" (not so many contemporary references and not such a colloquial style), and just a more deeply developed story with multiple layers of emotions and motives.I loved the brother-sister duo; it was great how they didn't languish in the stereotypical bro-sis antagonistic state for very long and quickly came to appreciate each other's unique talents and begin to feel friendship. Also, these siblings did have a lot to be "jealous" about given that after their mother's death they were separated at such young ages and each was bound to find something more appealing about the other's life. Older brother Carter got to go with his dad on trips around the world, learning a great deal from his father and having all kinds of adventures. Younger Sadie stayed with her grandparents in London, a stable life of going to school, hanging out with friends, etc. Each circumstance, and their natural-born talents, combine to make them a very important and formidable duo now that the Egyptian gods are stirring again and the fate of the world rests in their adolescent hands.The cast of supporting characters are a great deal of fun; I won't mention any as part of the charm of the series is discovering the new ones that pop up along the way. Suffice to say Riordan has really done his homework and if you are at all familiar with Egyptian mythology you'll find yourself chuckling over how cleverly he's integrated it into this story--and if you aren't familiar with it, chances are the book will inspire you to learn a little more.Finally, I think it's really cool that Carter is homeschooled and that the fact isn't really a main focus. Of course the typical "socialization" issue comes up, but since he never had a home-base and moved constantly with his father from one place to another I don't think this can be blamed on the homeschooling. Meanwhile, he is portrayed as a capable, thoughtful and intelligent young man and I say three cheers for a homeschool hero appearing in mainstream MG/YA literature ;-)The audiobook is a delight and the novel is perfectly suited to this format as the story itself is set up as a "recording" that Sadie and Carter are making. The story shifts between the two narrators (two chapters to Carter, two to Sadie and so on as in the book) and it's quite lively and engaging without being repetitive or confusing. I must say in a few cases I thought Kelgren and Freed could have been a little more in sync with how they vocalized the characters, and I'm afraid Freed's Sadie sounded rather like an old Agatha Christie grandmother sort than a 12-year-old hip Londoner but that is only a small criticism and did not detract from my overall enjoyment of this delightful tale. I'm eager for the sequel!
