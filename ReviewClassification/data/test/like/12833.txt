This is my fourth Toni Morrison novel but the first one to grab hold of my collar and shake me about. After only 2- and 3-star experiences - and a twenty-year hiatus - I finally understand how she came to win so many important literary prizes, including the Pulitzer and the Nobel.In "Song of Solomon", Morrison puts a lot before the reader and revels in paradoxes. Her characters are startingly unique but also archetypal. Her treatment of racial identity is both specific and universal. And her representations of individual worth and community value are often skin-tone superficial but also bone-deep. She is clear-eyed and impassioned but she does not preach. She refuses to lead her reader by the hand toward any particular judgment and avoids drawing facile conclusions. What she delivers is an exploration of a color-blind shared humanity viewed through a Black American historical and cultural sensibility. It is profound, authentic, and magnificent.As an interesting side note, this marks my second encounter in four months with a protagonist called "Milkman". As was true in Anna Burns' much more recent novel, Morrison's Milkman is the lightning rod that attracts and conducts his neighborhood's powerful energies; the maypole around which everyone else cavorts."Somehow everybody was using him for something or as something. Working out some scheme of their own on him, making him the subject of their dreams of wealth, or love, or martyrdom. Everything they did seemed to be about him, yet nothing he wanted was part of it."As is true of the carnival of Life, there's a lot happening beyond that maypole dance, and it's all worth investigating. I encourage you to read this book and see what you make of it, especially if you're in the mood for a modern classic.
