The Awakening Fate in Motion by Suzanne BoisvertStory starts out with Lainey and she's in the pool just relaxing. Like sign of the hawks overhead as many movies I'm recently watching have animals that will make a difference in their lives.Also a man who's in a mine and discovers a new thing that his sister is taping...Japanese psychiatrist who's going through some signs of something is wrong.James who is investigating things that don't make sense.Like individual stories and how they all have some common things.Information about the clock I find fascinating as it holds more than you can see.James feels he is the chosen one but his mother is rushed to the hospital...she's always talked about Knights Templar, aliens and theres confusion with a link to the government and presidents of the US.Interesting how they learn of their powers and how they are drawn to one another...Like the idea of how they have to use their powers...aliens come into play and hated to hear of bombings similar to 911 day in NYC.Liked all the travel and learning all about the different components of this whole book, wow how it all comes together.This book covers a lot of different genres: mystery, sci fic, romance, travel, crime, etc.Ends with acknowledgements and about the author and her other works .Received this review copy from the author via the publisher and this is my honest opinion.
