I randomly decided to listen to this because I wanted to watch the movie. It turned out to be a fascinating, yet disturbing mystery read. I couldn't stop listening, and came to care for these messed up characters. If you enjoy mysteries and thrillers, this is a must read. However, be warned, the content is pretty graphic.
