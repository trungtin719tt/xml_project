This is a wonderful, light, fluffy read. It was the first real 'chick lit' book I ever read and it got me hooked. The character is vivid and fun, and I can identify well (a bit too well!) with Becky Bloomwood and her retail therapy issues. I love the use of the present tense and first person narrative, I think it works brilliantly. I have now read all, except one, of Sophie Kinsella's books, which are all in the same vain, and they are fantastic reads within the 'chick lit' genre.
