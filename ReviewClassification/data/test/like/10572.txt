Why did Anne have to grow up so fast?The first book was fabulous! Lots of fun mischief but the second has her at 16 already! Where did those four years go?Laura Ingalls Wilderdidn't skimp out on the childhood.I enjoyed this book - seeing Anne blossom into a young school teacher (aside: Totally not fair that everyone get such great jobs out of high school?? Same with Laura Ingalls Wilder. They just handed out jobs to anyone who would take them!)A pet peeve of mine was really played upon.All kids are precocious angels.Yes, Anne has some struggles but you know from the start that she's going to overcome them magnificently.It's a little too predictable. And the precocious moments were bordering annoying.Also, did anyone else feel for poor Dora? Her twin brother, Davy, is acomplete bullying snotyet Anne and Marilla justadorehim (they even admit that the care more for that little snit)?!Sure Dora is quiet, but she is dutiful and obedient anddeserves twiceas much attention as they are lavishing on that horrible Davy.Still loved this book though!!Audiobook CommentsRead by Barbara Caruso and she really let this audio shine.Blog|Instagram|Twitter
