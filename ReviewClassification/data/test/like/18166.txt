Humanity or a majority of it uncomplainingly goes through a routine of daily life : sleep, wake up, eat, work, (fill in the knick knacks of family life), sleep again. Gradually there occurs a settling down of sorts and this becomes a comfort zone. Any intrusions or slight derailing of this humdrum of activity is seen with irritation by most of us. Personally my emotions are reserved to only two when met with people who break free of all these socially imposed dogmas : perplexity or scorn. It was then that I met Alexis Zorba and he broke and remoulded most of my prejudices about humanity and also about life !To my limited spectrum of such emotions was introduced a third one : envy. The kind of envy that rears its head when you get to meet someone who laughs in the face of life and kicks its balls in when faced with all the ugliness that the monster called life can muster. Zorba with his rascally shades of character and bawdy humor trivializes even the mightiest of life's blows. What has he not been ? A soldier, mercenary, lumberjack, miner, serial seducer of women are only some of the medals pinned to his lapel. To add to this, he is a fine cook and a philosopher to boot. By philosophizing you need not think of Plato or Marcus Aurelius or the other bearded wise men ! Zorba takes the mightiest of life's dilemmas and in the most simplified manner devises an explanation for them. The monologues he makes are sheer brilliance and unmatched in their profound understanding of human nature. There was many a point of similarity between the narrator and me and this made it a comfortable job of slipping inside his skin and listening to Zorba. On the windswept Cretan coast at night, with nothing but the stars for company we sat. Only a camp fire to warm our wary bones we talked on and on into the night until the first traces of dawn lit the far horizon !My point of contention with this novel is something that many an observer would have pointed out : it's treatment of women ! They are sidelined as objects of sexual satiation and as obedient bystanders at most times. There are flashes of a few good characters at places but mostly there is an oppressive air about this. The following Buddhist song quoted in the novel will give you the picture :Who then created this labyrinth of hesitation, this temple of presumption, this pitcher of sin, this field sown with a thousand deceptions, this gateway to hell, this basket overflowing with artfulness, this poison which tastes like honey, this bond which chains mortals to the earth : women ?We can perhaps look at the history of the nation and say that this was rampant during the timeframe of the novel. However, quite a lot references did not sit well with me during the tale. This truly was a deterrant !Zorba underwent a metamorphosis during the story for me. By the time the tale was told, he became Zorba the Great ! This book does not beg or cry to be read, it deserves to be read !
