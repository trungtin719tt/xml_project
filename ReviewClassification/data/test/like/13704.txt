ILOVEDthis book!! I read it over and over and have given copies to several people.The book starts off with a "handwritten" and smudged story, written like books in the Bible, by a auto mechanic who discovered the Divine in himself and was followed by throngs of people,who called him a messiah, until he had to disappear.Then the "real" book begins: A young man flys around the country in his airplane, supporting himself by selling flights in his plane. One fateful day, he meets a strange individual who seems to have amazing abilities, including (one of my favorites)preventing insects from smashing on the windshield.I feel that this book deepened my spirituality, and reinforced my desire to live life more peacefully, and with great kindness. I only wish I could perfect the "no-bugs-killed-on windshield" trick!! (Remember the Kleenex commercial about the monk who saves the spider, turtle, and fish, then after he blows his nose is dismayed to see that Kleenex kill germs? That is somewhat like me: I am always helping various critters outside--I don't like to kill anything. However, I don't worry about bacteria, molds, dust mites, mosquitos, and cockroaches. I am a hypocrite in that way!)
