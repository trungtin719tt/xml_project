Really enjoyed the inventiveness of Jasper Fforde's The Eyre Affair. The premise of the story is that original manuscripts can be stolen and then changed, not just that manuscript, but all copies of say, Jane Eyre. Thus, these original manuscripts are viewed as absolute treasures. There are also literary portals which intersect with the 'real world' which make it possible to change what happens in our favorite novel. And there's also time travel. And an alternate history which skews how we view this reality about 80 or 90 degrees. In Fforde's novel, our heroine, Thursday Next, tracks down a master criminal, a manuscript and interacts with the characters of Jane Eyre. However, the story unabashedly takes a backseat to literary puns and allusions and simple craziness. The world Fforde has created, a world both obsessed by books and with direct access to books, is a world book lovers will want to live in!Sitting down with Jasper Fforde for fried rice, eggrolls and great discussion during a break at the Casper Humanities Festival!!
