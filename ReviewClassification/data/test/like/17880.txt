This is the 20thDiscworldnovel so, technically, I've read this out of order (I haven't read #19 yet) but it being Christmas made me and my fellow buddy-readers mix it up a little because it was too good an opportunity to pass up.It is almost Hogwatch Night, the Discworld's version of Christmas and the Hogfather (Santa) is ... a little different. For starters, he's gone. And when he does show up after all, he's a skeleton and his pixie is ... well, Albert plus a considerable number of sherries. Death has taken over from the original Hogfather in order to save the universe, sort of.The Death of Rats is getting Susan, because if anyone can stop true catastrophe from striking (which it will if order isn't restored since Death isn't too good at being human - or, rather, too good at it), it's the half-human-half-Death governness with the poker that makes any monster run for cover. Oh, and he's aided by the raven he befriended last time.After a brief period of denial, she goes with the pair to look after her grandfather. After all, he did expressly forbid her from getting involved.Unfortunately, there's a very creative assassin, too, and the Auditors are egging him on (they really should know better from their last plot). And Ridcully and the wizards - along with Hex - have their hands full as well when helping both Death and Susan.Each and every group of characters was hilarious. From Hex only working when it's given its teddy bear and the ever complaining raven, to the terrified monsters and Death of Rats squeaking excitedly. Then there are also the contemplative musings of Death with Albert and/or Susan. There was fun, there was suspense, there was the signature humour as sharp as Death's scythe, ... In short: another perfect addition to the series.For a better look at what I mean when I say this novel is very deep and contemplative, please have a look at all the quotes I highlighted - because I scarcely have words.Moreover, this had a peculiar seasonal feel to it what with all the magical beings coming into the world and us seeing our own traditions and customs through the distorted lens of this flat but oh-so-well-rounded world.
