This is one of those rare moments when I bump a 4-star that I read many years ago up to 5-star. Usually a book isn't quite as magical on the second read, though with authors like King the rating normally stays the same as before.But here, I realize that I underestimated just what The Talisman did for me. More than once I thought that it felt like Tolkien. I was often reminded of The Dark Tower (which I had not yet read during my first visit to the Territories). A Mark Twain boy's adventure even came to mind, blending with the Looking-Glass element of flipping back and forth between the pollution infested tired modern world and one of magical wonder.Fans of Harry Potter should like this as well. Not because of any magical jumping candy frogs or a really awesome sounding name like "Hermione", but because this is where a young boy is set on the path to becoming a man. Not just aging and growing up, but learning about the important things in his life. Friends. Loyalty. Family. Honor. Integrity. And just flat out doing the right thing.Jack Sawyer grows up a lot in this book, much like Huck Finn, Frodo Baggins, and Harry Potter before him. Yes, he goes on an adventure, like they did. But more importantly, he learns what it means to remain true to those that call you "friend".
