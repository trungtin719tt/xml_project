Just another day in Cat's life!"If anyone's under a spell, Justina, it's me. Your daughter put one on me five years ago, and I haven't broken free of it yet. Oh, and you'll be delighted to know, we've decided to resume our relationship. Don't bother with congratulations-trust me, your expression is congratulations enough."-Bones"But I'm not going to let you or anyone else decide what I do with my personal life anymore. You don't have to like Bones. Hell, you can hate his guts for all I care, but as long as I'm with him, you will have to tolerate him. So will Don and the others, or...or I'll leave and never come back."-CatBones is the sexiest vampire ever! He was even better in this book. I loved how he handled Justina (Cat's mom). His love for Cat was unconditionally and unwavering. He fought for her, searched for her, and never gave up on her. I loved Bones jealous side, but I feel he acted like a saint, because I would have killed Tate. Cat was as bad ass as ever. I love that she really shows some growth in this book, standing up to everyone, and not letting them trash talk Bones, or all vampires in general. She has a confidence in this book that was just sexy. And a smart mouth that had me laughing hard."You know the old saying. Once you go dead, no one's better in bed."-CatHe wore a purely masculine smile that had passed smug and hovered near conceited. I couldn't stop shaking, especially when he kissed me and I tasted blood and other things on his tongue. "Oh, Kitten," he growled. "You have no idea how much I enjoyed that. I've already spilled myself inside you, bloody hell, I thought you'd castrate me with your pleasure. Do you know how long you've been whipping around from the effects of my bite?" Not a clue. "Five minutes?" To my shock, my voice was hoarse and nearly unrecognizable. He chuckled. "Try twenty, give or take a few. The police have already come and gone; Annette sent them away. I think the neighbors thought someone was being murdered."-Bones and CatI missed Bones so much in the parts of the book when he was out of the picture, but I still loved Cat so much that it didn't take away from my enjoyment of this book. That first time Bones said "Hallo Kitten" I squealed, bouncing up and down in my seat, clapping like a idoit yelling Yay Bones is back! Bones and Cat have such a strong connection. There is some ex drama in this book and of course Tate drama(Tate is one of Cat's team mates, but he is in love with her). OMG OMG OMG chapter 32. The sex in chapter 32 holy hell, it set my body on fire, melted my bones, made me start shaking, and left me basking in the afterglow. Fuck but that was the single best sex scene I have ever read ever. Ever! Bones is such a dirty naughty boy Dayum! I wanted to stab Bones's ex Annette and I was so happy when Cat beat the shit outta her and then of course stabbed her!"I am going to knock the slut out of you, Annette," I gritted between clenched teeth. "And that should take some doing, you uppity English tramp!"-Cat"I didn't miss, bitch. One flick of my wrist and you're a bad memory and an even worse smell. I think we need to have a little talk, woman to skank. I know why you're doing this. You want me to leave him again, but I can save you the oxygen in your words, because it won't happen. Bones forgave me for deserting him and running off for years, so you can bet your overused, group-orgy twat that I will forgive him for one bad mouthful of you. Now, are we very clear on that?"-Cat"Not everything, but some things. I knew without a doubt I'd fallen in love when we met. Then I knew I'd do anything to make you feel the same way."-BonesTons of action, amazing characters, and a great plot. I love this series and I can't wait to read the next one. I am a Bones and Cat fangirl for life!"You'd better not stop fucking me," I snarled, and a decadent grin lit his face. "Because if you do, I'll drain you dry." Bones laughed, savage and exultant. "You'll drain me dry, but not my neck, and you'll beg me to stop before I'm finished," he promised before abandoning himself to the battle.-Cat and Bones"Feeling better, mate?" he inquired of Cooper. "If not, you will soon. Don drained a pint out of me just now, Kitten," he said with a grin. "Seems the head pathologist didn't want to stick me himself. Poor bloke was quite jittery, though I can't imagine why." "Could be because you made dinner out of his assistant, amigo," Juan dryly commented. Cooper hadn't heard that. He swung his gaze to me. "We're letting him eat people?" "Apparently," Tate snarled.
