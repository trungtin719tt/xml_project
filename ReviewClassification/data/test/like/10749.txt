Basically, every single one of these books makes me want to break into song and dance!They got the UNSEELIE oooooooout!!Shoulder. Chin. Shoulder, shoulder, shoulder. DOUBLE DREAM HANDS!!!!There may be minor spoilers in this review. They are mainly just spoilers about the general feeling of the end result, definitely not about any specifics or plot twists. I don't think it's any big spoiler to say that by the end of this book, the Unseelie are mostly wiped out of Dublin. Most people probably assumed that would happen or at least hoped.As I sit here wearing my "Dublin rocks" t-shirt (I'm not exaggerating), pondering and daydreaming, I have come across a great revelation.I am ruined.I am ruined for every single other urban fantasy. I am ruined for every other paranormal romance. Hell, I'm ruined for every other book EVER. How could I go back to YA after this? How can I go on in urban fantasy when I started at the top? How can I ever read another book again?!?! Of course, I'm being melodramatic but somewhere inside, I feel it's true. I know I'll get over it. Eventually.While I loved it, I had quite a few issues with this book, so here we go:1.The Dani Perspective- Dani is a relentless spitfire. Unfortunately that means what often spews forth from herisfire and it's painful. It burns my eyes and my brain. I love Dani but enough with the rambling, woman! I felt like every time we were dumped into Dani's head, it was tedious and unnessecary. A technique that is used by writers of lesser talent to rachett up the tension between the scenes that you actually want to be in. KMM is better than that. She doesn't need to use this ploy. Not to mention, it's annoying as feck inside Dani's head.2.The Gimmicks- The Dani Daily, the quotes and song lyrics before every "part", the conversations with the Sinsar Dubh, switching of perspectives. Once again, KMM is better than this. And if all these things are so important to the mythology of the series, where were they in all the previous books? Why fling these on us now? We didn't need them. All it did was take away from time I'd rather be spending with our main characters.3.The info dumps and recaps- By the halfway point, I felt like almost nothing had happened. So much time was spent rehashing past events and reintroducing red herrings and 'clues'. This was happening much more often than was necessary. Along with tons of internal dialogue and speculation. Am I this? Am I that? Is he this or that? Blah blah blah. Just get to the action.5.Lovetastic Endless Forever Love- Yes, its what we've always wished for! But as soon as Barrons and Mac got together and (sort of) declared their love, I was bored. I know that's childish of me but I wanted hate sex! Not loooooove sex. Boring! I know that once again I'm being melodramatic but KMM basically turned us into Pavlov's dogs, training us to drool every time Barrons acted animalistic. And she did it with good reason. I felt the scenes thereafter were a little too cheesealicious. And apparently,(view spoiler)[Barrons has amagicwingding!(hide spoiler)]Oh damn, I'm drooling again...MEEEEEE-YOW!4.And the thing that pisses me off the most- I still don't know what the feck Barrons is! I mean,I know"what" he is, but I don't know why or what the hell it has to do with the rest of the story. It's like she took two completely unrelated stories and mythologies and meshed them together. It frustrates me quite a bit. But do I care? A little. Would I take any of it back? Hell no.The way I see it is: it's about the journey not the destination.Much the way I felt at the end of Lost -What the faaaaaa?What the batman was the smoke monster? Maybe it was Batman! The effing writers don't even know!!And Battlestar Galactica -Why the frak?I still don't know what the bejesus Starbuck was? Was she Jesus?? Hell if I know! Hell if she knows!Sure, I was disappointed that I didn't get the exact answers that I wanted. I'm not always sure if I got ANY answers (mainly with Lost). But regardless - the journey was incredible, intense, and inspiring. If I had been hung up on the answers, I never would have been able to feel the full range of the emotions of the characters. I wouldn't have been able to vicariously live out adventures through the people in the book or on the screen. If I only focused on the logic and found myself unable to suspend my disbelief, I'd have the emotional range of a robot (well, these days that might be becoming less and less limited but you get what I'm saying, I hope.)Maybe life isn't always about the answers, maybe it's about the search.I love it when you get inside a book. You become the book - flowing out of and into it like some sort of monster, helplessly attached.KMM's books are the Sinsar Dubh and I am the Beast.Overall, I was consumed by these books. I loved the series, the story arch and the characters. What an amazing journey! I feel likedancing around throwing confetti,riding a magic carpet through the sky while singing, andslathering my face with birthday cake!!DOUBLE DREAM HANDS EXTREEEEEEEEME!!!I don't know what to do with myself now. I'm going to have to revert to the hermit version of myself, who can only be consoled by eating peanut butter and apple slices while watching Buffy or Battlestar reruns and is onlytrulyhappy while watching and singing along to the Buffy Musical "Once More with Feeling."We've all talked before about who should play the characters in a movie, but I've changed my mind -- I don't want a movie. I WANT A FECKIN TV SHOW!!!! I want to see Barrons every damn week. Not just two hours of glorious hotness and beauty in one year. I wanttwenty-twohours!! For years to come. Don't you want to see someone who looks similar tothison TV?Seriously. With the mega success of shows like the Vampire Dairies and True Blood, why hasn't someone come up with something to compete or stand on the same level but from a different mythology. With the right people at the helm, thiscould. This could surpass it. Not to mention, I would love to see Kristen Bell on a series again and she's perfect for Mac. God knows it would be difficult to find a man hot enough to play Barrons, but it would be so worth it when they did.I'm actually getting goosebumps talking about seeing him on my TV every week.Really,only in a TV show, could the characters fully be explored and fleshed out. Only then could we really experience their changes. Shadowfever was the #1 NYT Bestseller. That HAS to speak for the power of it's reach and it's fans.I know nothing about websites or blogs but pleeeeeeease - if there is anyone reading who does, start some sort or petition for a TV show based on the Fever series. Or a twitter campaign or a facebook page. Hell - do them all! Andpost a link HEREand everyone sign up!! I will post a link on my review and anywhere else I can!Gorgeous!
