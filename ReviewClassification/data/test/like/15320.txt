***November 2018 Update***So this one wasn't quite as action packed but a lot happened. Not only does Sookie have protection of the Shreveport Were's now we has Vampire protection as well. We also got to meet Hunter - he seems like the cutest little boy and he's a telepath as well. Also we get to meet Niall - Sookies great grandfather in this one, another Fairy. He is an interesting character. FINALLY Eric remembers everything from his time with Sookie - things with them should be picking up soon!!!!!!This was one of my favorites because there is a lot going on in this book. The last book didn't have a lot of action so this one makes up for it. Debbie Pelt, man that woman pisses me off to know end. I really enjoyed all the Eric in this book. I am sad Quinn is gone though he was delicious. I also love Sam, he is always there when Sookie needs him. I think as much as I like Eric I would much prefer Sookie and Sam together....
