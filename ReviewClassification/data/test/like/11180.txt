This was a re-read and I own a physical copy of the entire series!Prince Caspian was such a good book to read, being in an adventurous mood at the time, this was one of the best picks to go with. I felt quite fulfilled by the end and happy to return to the lives of Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy. They arrive back in Narnia one year in their earth lifetime but over a thousand years in Narnia's lifetime. Everything is in ruins when they explore what used to be areas full of life. The talking animals were fun to read about and the fast pacing really worked well for this story-line. The movie is really good as well, ending however was quite emotionally and I generally forgot how upset I was as a child as the final curtain drew on their travels. Highly recommend!
