2016 -I just finished my year-long quest to read everything Dark Tower and listen to everything DT I could find on audio. There is a very differentfeelto the tale when read to you by someone else. I loved it, but sadly, the final CD broke about halfway through. Weird, right? I think it may have been God's way of telling me toreadthe end, not listen. That brings up a very interesting thing that just occurred to me.I don't want to spoil anything, but for those who have read it (and had their hearts broken) does our continuing to read past the warning cause a reset? Is it our, the readers, fault? If I stopped listening after the epilogue (coincidentally, when my CD broke!) would there have been success?My head is spinning and I need to think about this more.2009 -I finally finished. Let me begin by saying that I think the readers who complain about the ending are...whining! It was perfect. I don't want to post spoilers, but personally, I believe thatTHIS TIMEhe will actually complete his quest. That one mistake was made, something left behind, he obviously has it this time around...task completed. It just took a few "drafts", if you will.I realized in this book, that as much as I loved Roland's Ka-Tet, Susannah was important to me only because of her interaction with "the boys". I didn't like her as well without her love of Eddie and Jake to wriggle in my heart. The care she took of Patrick wasn't enough to keep my feelings for her strong. Having said that, I felt she left the tale with awhimper, as opposed to theBANG!I felt her contributions deserved. That's not a complaint, just an observation.A friend has been in love with Eddie Dean since his first appearance. Although my love came late, I love Roland. In this installment especially, I fell head-over-heels in love. No, he isn't the most sensitive, sympathetic sweetheart, but if Roland Deschain loves you, although you may die a tragic death, your life will have been worth the living. He willNOTforget your love and your memory will live forever in the field of roses. Each time he said "My dear" my heart would melt a bit more than I felt was possible. There was never a more faithful, honest, protective man of his true friends. Yes, being important to him probably brings a sad end, but it's a sad end worth the trip.I had no problem with King's insertion of himself into the story. As he explains, and I have always felt, fantasy is so much more believable with a realistic touchstone to anchor my belief.HEwas my anchor here. I know he painted himself differently than he really appears, but wouldn't we all? It doesn't make his contribution to the story any less important or central. KingISGan for Roland's world. He certainly wasn't going to come right out andSAYthat, but we, the constant readers, know that. HeSHOULDbe there. How could the tale be spun without his presence?When Roland speaks the names of his fallen comrades, and loves, at the end of his path, tears ran down my face. Hundreds more died on the journey to his quest, butTHESEare the deaths he felt. The deaths that made him the man he has become. The man I have come to love more and more with each installment, but mostly withTHISone. In this one the cost of that walk up the Tower steps was tangible to me, the reader, and I criedFORhim. Not justWITHhim, butFORhim.I am completely certain that this go-round, he succeeds, and that's exactly the ending I would choose. As King says, life never ends with a happily ever after, but give the hope of SOME happiness, and I can accept that. Roland deservesSOMEhappiness, or at lest the feeling of a job well done. I think at the end of this round he will have it.
