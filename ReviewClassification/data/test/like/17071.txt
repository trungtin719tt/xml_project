3,5 STARSI wanted to read this book for a long time and now I finally took the time and did it. I love reading PNR books with plots that have action, romance and are overall just pure magic to read about. It's just something about the fictional worlds that can make you forget about the stressful daily life. So when I finished this one, I don't know if I had too high hopes or maybe it was something else, but I expected more from it. I always say simple is best and that also applies to this writing style. Sometimes I couldn't enjoy the book quite as much because of that. What I did love is the action, that we've got plenty of and but what I was missing was more romance, more soul bonding and expressionism about what they felt. We get both POVs but I would've liked for the characters to talk and open up more about themselves, especially Anna. She's been though three years of hell and all the abuse would leave scars on anyone. So I felt like that issue wasn't really resolved. For me, I felt like their relationship wasn't build up well enough for me to believe it or be completelly comfortable with it. I enjoyed Charles's character. He is definitely a good mate, who's patient and so caring. I didn't like the scene in the prewuel with his ex but it's fine. We can't get everything we want. I did like the rest of the characters and I wonder if they'll get their own stories. My heart broke for the poor rough wolf and Asil. I wished they'd get their happy ending but their loss make their lives just a little more special.Overall, I did like this story. It's a great PNR book, with lovely characters and since the wolves want to become more public in the next books that follow, I think this might make for an interesting series.
