Don't let the cover, description, cover reviews, or hell, even the title throw you off on this one. It looks like a cheesy paperback. Possibly even a twisted romance novel, but believe me it's not.It takes place in a world where instead of going to the moon, money went into bioengineering. Of course something went wrong a virus got out, in tomatoes. Like a plague it started wiping out humans, Inlanders however (people and beings with mystical abilities, witches, weres, pixies etc.) were immune. Well except for the Elves. They went completely extinct. It hit them worse than humans. By the time the thing was under control the population of regular humans and Inlanders was roughly the same. No longer feeling the need to hide, being as they were no longer the minority to be prosecuted, the Inlanders became open about who they were. Therefore regular humans and Inlanders live openly together.Well for the most part. There are prejudices. If you think that is a bit complicated, it's only the back drop. But don't let that scare you. The story is quite entertaining.Racel Morgan, witch, is a runner for the IS the inlander version of FIB. Basically the FBI or Police for naughty or rather evil Inlander's. Long story short, she breaks her contract with them and their best runner, Ivy (a living vampire) with her. So there's a death threat out on her head. She doesn't have the money to pay it off so she goes for the next best thing. She'll crack a case so good they'll have to leave her alone. Of course it means going after Cincinnati's best loved, most powerful, and due to his refusal to say whether he's human or Inlander, most neutral political body, Trent. It's not long before Rachel Morgan has more on her ass than a bunch of angry and magical assassins.I will grant that the first 20 pages or so of this book are a little bit cheesy. Ok a lot a bit. But in an amusing, we-know-it's-harsh-but-it's-just-to-pull-you-in kind of way. For instance she catches a leprechaun using charms that are a yellow moon, green clover, purple heart... ha. But after I was introduced to the intelligent back story, these quips were easy to forgive. And I promise eventually Jenks the nonstop talking pixie becomes less annoying, even to Rachel.As for the smutty romance part that the cover of this book in some odd ways seems to impart, forget about it. Romance is the last thing on Ms. Morgan's mind. Between disguises, almost dying, and spending an unruly amount of time as a rodent, she just doesn't have the time.The book was action packed, and kept me guessing. When I returned to it, it was like returning to a weekly drama. I liked it.I have only a few small complaints. 1. I think the slightly cheesy beginning could throw some people off. 2. Sometimes Rachel's inner insecurities don't reflect her outer actions, but perhaps that is the beauty of her character. She's so insecure she HAS to look tough. 3. A few minor fight moves in the last big fight seem to get pulled off a little too smoothly. After keeping it clumsily realistic for 320 pages, I wasn't ready for a perfect toss to trip and down a guy. But alas, minor complaint. 4. Sometimes the character of Rachel bothers me a bit. But just a bit. It's actually a good sign that I'm taking her seriously as a character. So yeah, I guess that's not really a complaint.Basically this is a first book a decently lengthened series, that I plan to purchase the rest of. It is my sinful little delight stacked up there with all my educational and political outlook books and good strong straight fiction. Hooray.I recommend it. The latest book is in Hardback and just came out. I can't wait to catch up to it!p.s. Harrison doesn't answer all questions, in fact she does a fine job of raising a few at the end, and you know what, I don't mind. That' s rare, but maybe it's because I know there's another book out there :)
