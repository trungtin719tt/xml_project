Ok, wow. The ending for this series was everything I could have hoped for. Every loose end from the series is tied up by the end, and we get closure with each of the main character's. Getting to finally "see" the Dark Tower was such a relief, after 6.5 books of searching for it, Mr. King will make you feel as if you're standing at Roland's side the rest of the way. I highly recommend this series as a whole, but would suggest reading a few books before going on this journey: Salem's Lot, It, Insomnia, Hearts in Atlantis, and The Stand. Reading these before The Dark Tower series will make it that much more fulfilling by the end of the journey. I've read all those books except for Insomnia, so there were some references that went over my head!Dark Tower 7 - 5 starsDark Tower Series - 4.5 stars
