It seems that for me Mitch Albom can do no wrong!This is my fourth novel by him and I thought it was wonderful! Albom seems to have an incredible ability to take ordinary situations and the inevitable pain of life and make them magical.For One More Day focuses on Charles (Chick) Bennetto, a middle aged man with a failing marriage, obscene amounts of debt and an inner grief he's never gotten over. He hits rock bottom when he is left uninvited to his only daughters wedding.We watch as Chick tries to take his own life, and in doing so enters a kind of dream state where he is able to spend one more day with his deceased mother.Chick is so relatable. He is all of us at some point - unsure of himself, mediocre, desperate for love. So to watch his pain and go through what he goes through is so hard and really hits home.Mitch Albom has done it once again and I was teary eyed by the end!
