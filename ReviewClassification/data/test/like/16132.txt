Oh Chuck, there isn't a book of yours that I've read that didn't leave my brain feeling pretty fucked up. Eventhough I love you and your amazing writing style, I had to give this one a 4. I didn't find it as "exciting" as your other books. The basic story idea was great, and as always you had the female character who's so fucked up she just adds to the story. I thought it started out strongly, but as soon an Tender Branson (the main character) got lost in his fame I felt a little bored. I also thought the ending could have been a little more dramatic. Otherwise, as always Mr, Palahniuk, I salute you. You are one hell of a writer.
