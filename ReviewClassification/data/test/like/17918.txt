I Will Survive[condensed 6/27/16]Maybe the first notable Western novel hitting a favored theme in the arts: the ugly duckling's transformation into a swan and turning the table back against her rejector with a big ...This brings to mind a song likeI Will Survive(Gloria Gaynor):weren't you the one who tried to hurt me with goodbye?Did you think I'd crumbleDid you think I'd lay down and dieOh no, not II will survive...Pushkin's one-of-a-kind novel-in-verse set in Russia in the early 1800s is told in 389 stanzas of iambic tetrameter. In it, Tatiana falls deeply for Eugene Onegin while he visits her home with a friend who's engaged to Tatiana's beautiful younger sister Olga. Tatiana, at the time rather plain, confesses her love for Eugene in a letter. He politely rejects her, in favor of pursuing shallow, vain Olga, putting him at odds with his friend (and into a duel).Years later, Onegin sees the now extraordinarily beautiful Tatiana at a society ball in St. Petersburg and becomes obsessed with winning her affections, despite the fact she's now married. Saying anything more would be a spoiler.Pushkin's Onegin is apparently the first among a long line of fictional Russian "superfluous men," a character type Pushkin borrowed from Lord Byron and his "Byronic hero," a miserable, cynical, passive man, usually borne from privilege, full of himself yet deeply sensitive.Tolstoy compared Pushkin's storytelling to Homer's. By comparison, Dostoevsky condemned Eugene Onegin as a "Western intrusion and [the] glorification of Tatiana as the exemplar of Russian womanhood." Professor Stanley Mitchell notes Russian "[r]adicals and conservatives fought over Pushkin's characters as if they were real people."Recommended for change of pace, especially if you enjoy epic poems.
