Vonnegut,Kozinski,Christopher Moore and now Chuck Pahlaniuk have tapped the black humour of all the mainstream sacred cows, with stylish grace and the prescient ablity to extrapolate the consequences of our most innocuous acts.Another commonality: they all have the uncanny ability to transform our feelings for their ungainly, unlikely,unlikable, sometimes even rather repulsive oddball freak heroes from clinicly detached to warm and fuzzy. Quite a class act.We may not like them, but they are us. No matter that we are not flitting about in our private jet nor yet hijakking someone elses flight,not slogging through dense undergrowth or along remote mountain passes, we can see the logic in the exteme actions of the characters, and can easily place ourselves in the action.If you can get past the truly awful bits at the beginning and want to know anything more about a powertripping,manipulative, emotionally stunted slob, you may read on to reluctantly accept that this is an apt archetype for the kind of people the system (church,state, and economic)are churning out. CP has brilliantly exposed the paradoxes of power and the vacuum in the soul of American culture.CP's irony is consistently in your face but he can also be subtle. His trick of pagination starting at the beginning of the end with the countdown to zero, was not something GR could handle. My reading graph for this book is hilarious. But how fitting the metaphor for societies negative progress.The Irony of Names...First, the irony of Tender being the generic name for boys brought up to obey without question,the authority and the rules instilled in them by their elers.This entailed suppression of all the qualities, compassion, emotional depth and sensitivity to ones own as well as primarily the feelings of others,that most prominently define the origianl meaning of the word.That Our Hero continues to use this name, almost as a pseudonum,even when discarding his uniform of faith, confirms his passive/accepting character. He is lost without instructions, yet he feeds on praise and goes through severe withdrawel when deprived of his audience.That our unflappable heroine, the plucky and prescient Fertility Hollis, believes that she is sterile,gives her the protection she requires for the most distressing aspect of her job as a surrogate mother, the possibility of actually having to conceive and carry off a pregnancy. I think CP is rubbing it in here with his imagry of a depraved and barren aspect of the abundancy that surrounds us, always hungry for more. I found it rather chilling that Fertility acheived her blase attitude to the disasters she predicted by accepting the fact that it was useless to warn people because not only would they not believe her, they would question her ability.It is interesting to note the wide variety of responses posted for this book on GR.I can see that some people might get bogged down in being offended. I thought it was great reading and a wickedly accurate assessment of the situation here as it is evolving.There are also scattered about this terrific, provocative book some really basic and practical helpful hints for stain removal and basic houshold micro management.
