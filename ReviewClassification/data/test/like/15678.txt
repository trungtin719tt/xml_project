i began this book several years ago. i thought it was a non-fictional journal, and once i found out that it was fictional i couldn't get back into the book. Since that time, my mom and sister have pleaded with me to finish this book, as it is an all-time favorite for both of them. i finally heeded their suggestion, and i am so glad i did! i devoured this book and couldn't wait to read each day. set in the late 19th century and written as a journal, it is a captivating story of a feisty, determined woman, sarah prine, and her experiences in frontier arizona. the early journal entries are poorly written, as sarah is mostly illiterate. as the book develops, sarah's writing becomes more and more polished, mimicking the character herself. by the end of the book, sarah is a polished, literate, hard-working, capable, devoted mother, wife and friend. she is someone that i respect and look up to. without giving too much away, the love story in this book is one of the best i have ever read...it will leave you ALWAYS wanting more! the book climaxes about 2/3 of the way in and then kind of comes down from there. it's not tied up in a neat little package at the end, which is usually how i prefer a story to end. but this time it didn't bother me because that's how real life is. you will not be disappointed if you read this book. you may even want to read it again...
