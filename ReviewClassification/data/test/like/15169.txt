I love this series. I also love the True Blood series that's based on this series of books. I've always been a believer in not reading the book if you're going to watch the movie, read it afterward but for this series the rule doesn't apply. They've changed the series so much from the book that I can read the books and still enjoy the HBO series. I enjoy both and this book follows right along with the previous Sookie Stackhouse installments. Ms. Harris has a penchant for leaving me hanging on the edge of my chair fixed on the words of her book. The only problem is that I keep blowing through the books at a rapid pace and everything around me is put on hold until I get finished.Have you watched the HBO series? No? Do it! And read the books right on through without worry because after the first book the storyline between the HBO series and the books take different paths. You'll enjoy both.
