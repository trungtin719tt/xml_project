How could this be anything other than enjoyable, when it was penned by George Eliot? Although this was a simpler story with a more overt theme than others, likeMiddlemarch, it still provided plenty of food for thought. It's a simple tale of faith lost and regained, the redemptive powers of love, and the powerful effect that human connections can have on our lives. Lovely, and highly recommended for lovers of classics and excellent writing.
