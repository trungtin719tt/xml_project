Wow.At first, I was really skeptical towards the book. Junky and Trainspotting had had a very different input about heroin and the course of addiction you undergo with the drug, and I was even surprised when I researched Hurbert Selby Jr. and found that he had been addicted to heroin after being subjected to experimental drug treatment as a cure to his tuberculosis.The first half of the book is too happy. With occasional heroin use, the characters are not concerned about heroin sickness, their sex drive is off the roof and they're way too in love with each other (yes, that's you, Harry and Marion), for the novel to try and depict a realistic narrative on heroin usage.All this, however, the future planning, the construction of their own american dream, in some sense, was necessary for the ultimate demolition that the characters go through. Hubert Selby Jr. strips the characters of any decency and humanity, refilling the hole with addiction, an insatiable hunger that feeds on their own wrung out bodies. It is truly incredible how Selby managed to paint an unrealistic, in my eyes, image of happiness, only to battle it with the most realistic description of the withering away of human will. Kudos to Selby for creating the most heartbreaking requiem for a dream. No one gets saved and the futility of the events makes you want to stare out of the window, curled up in a foetal position, lightly rocking back and forth.When it comes to futility, Sara Goldfarb was the epitome of it (I don't want to spoil anything, but just know that no one is saved). Upon getting addicted to diet pills that make her lose her appetite, shit hits the fan. "Now the shit really hit the fan. It must have hit something because it sure as hell wasnt floating around the city." Selby even wriggles enough black humour to make it bearable, at first. Anyway, back to Sara. Her character is surely the most depressing one out of all. She definitely gets the short straw in the whole deal, basically because she's already pitiful to start off with, so Selby saves the worst for her. The events she undergoes could have been avoided with such ease it's even predicable she'll end fucked up, but the extent of fucked up, no way would I thought that. She just wanted to be on the show :(.The destruction of the selves they were at the start is complete, being reduced to nothing, writhing in their own sickness, craving, pain, disease, regret, coldness... Wow, just wow Hubert Selby Jr. you fucked the characters real good.I need to comment on the prose style as well. Next to no punctuation, jargon used consistently, no speech marks and speech imitated as each character talks ("Hey, whats the matta with me fa krists sake? I know where we can get the bread, Marion. You think she give us the braid? Sure. No sweat. An we/ll be able to pay her tonight anyway, right? Right on baby, they ave each other five." Tyrone and Harry discuss borrowing money off Marion, Harry's girl), it is at first hard to understand, not knowing who is talking when, IF they're talking or if it is narrative, but once you get accustomed to it (relatively easily), your eyes glide through the page, the lack of punctuation in moments of psychosis and madness, adding to the sense of breathlessness and confusion. Truly a work of art. With this experimental piece of prose, Selby has truly managed it to be a successful experiment.Yes, the novel is about addiction, that's highlighted through Sara Goldfarb, her addiction to the television and eventually her diet pills, but it is also, as the title indicates, a requiem for a dream, and what a brutal one it is.Finally, on the cover of the book, there is a review by Lou Reed, 'If you read this, be careful...'. At first, I thought it was a warning referring to the first pages, depicting such a picturesque scenario, heroin doesn't seem harmful, good ol' Reed warning the reader as to not fall into its trap, but as the novel progresses, it cannot possibly be a warning, the novel enough to scare an addict out of their habit. I just wanted to emphasise how much the 'idyllic' scenario of the beginning is essential to provide such a striking contrast. I have my own interpretation of Lou Reed's review upon having read the book, but I'll spare it as it's not important.I feel likehttps://www.goodreads.com/review/show...(beware spoilers!!) says everything I wish I could say and more.
