This was, without a doubt, one of the most powerful and well-crafted books I have read in a really long time.Elements that made this book outstanding:1) It started with a map and a family tree. Talk about setting yourself up for success!2) The personification of emotion. This might not make sense unless you've read the book, but wow it was powerful.3) The use of fairy tales from the main character to describe situations.4) The sense of complete mystery and suspicion: I was always questioning everything.5) The use of dramatic lines. You know when an author brings in an epic moment-stopping line? This was full of those awesome drops!6) The moment. There's a moment where all is revealed and IT WAS PERFECT.7) The consequential understanding. Everything suddenly clicked into place and it was glorious.8) The side characters. I think sometimes side characters can feel inconsequential and here they felt really important.There weren't very many things I didn't like, to be honest, but there was one:1) The title. It does't make sense to me. I don't want to say anything in case spoilers, but I don't think it's the perfect title.Two final things:1) I have a theory. I have a theory about this book that I'm really excited to discuss so I'm going to make a video about it!2) This book really made me cry. Like explode cry. Lots of tears. And I've only ever cried at 2 other books.I absolutely recommend this book, to everyone who likes books, because MAN, THIS WAS A GOOD BOOK.
