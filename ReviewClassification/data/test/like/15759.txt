4.5*I loved this book.I thought it was a little long, and at times I got bored, which I justified by putting myself is in the shoes of those poor jurors who spent all that time in court. Besides, the unraveling of Marlee's secret wasn't that great. I don't know; it seems a little flimsy. Her parents died of lung cancer because they smoked, so she spends her adult life and her inheritance making tobacco companies pay.We also don't really know why Nicholas/Jeff goes along with this, the whole living in secrecy and moving around every few years, following every single tobacco trial. Well, other than the fact that he loves her, and, predictably, doesn't like tobacco companies either ever since he worked at a law firm. Overall, I would say that this novel lacks a few details that could really flesh out the characters and provide the readers with their motivations. However, it is pretty appropriate that we don't know a lot about these characters: the Jury, this twelve-headed justice monster, is such an important amorphous character in this play. Also, we only know about Marlee and Nicholas what they want us to know about them. And they choose to remain in the shadows, disclosing little bits of information as deemed necessary and so that's what we'll know.Finally, I don't understand the stock market so I really don't get how she made so much money short selling, so that big reveal was lost on me.All of that being said, I gave this book those five stars for a reason. It was incredibly engaging. This book was a mystery, a drama, a moral dilemma, all wrapped in a magnificent bundle. I enjoyed it a lot and would definitely recommend it.
