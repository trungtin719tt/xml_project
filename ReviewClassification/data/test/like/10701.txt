SO SO SO SO GOOD! Yelena was amazing and had such great character development in the story. The romance took the back seat in the book and instead focused a lot about the conflict at hand. So good and Valek....SWOON!!I just got the second book in the trilogy Magic Study and cannot wait to read it!I'll be talking about Poison Study in my March Wrap Up video!
