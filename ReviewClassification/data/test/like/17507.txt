Love is the Answer, God is the Cure is the story of Aimee Cabo Nikolov and her incredible life. It is a fascinating book about all the things that she lived through in her life, from abuse to addiction and more things than you can imagine.I wasn't sure what to expect from this book. With the mention of God in the title I was concerned that it might be preachy but it was not at all. It was the opposite actually. At the beginning of each chapter there was a prayer that went along with the content of each chapter, and Aimee discussed her faith and how it helped her survive without trying to push it on to the reader which I really enjoyed.This is a very important story, and should be read by anyone who has struggled in their lives so they know that you can come back from Hell. I would like to thank the author for sharing her story with the world, it took a lot of bravery. I hope that it is able to help someone in their journey.
