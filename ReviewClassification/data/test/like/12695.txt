It's probably safe to assume Neal Stephenson is some sort of freakish genius, along the lines ofDavid Foster Wallaceor someone. I felt at times while reading Cryptonomicon that I was readingInfinite Jestagain, which isn't really a good comparison since the books have nothing to do with one another. Except this is my review and this is how I roll. Both authors can cram an exorbitant amount of information in less than 2000 pages, and to read it all makes ones head hurt, but in a good way. Like you're learning something. Stephenson takes his readers from WWII to the Internet boom of the 90s, discusses cryptography ad nauseum, and seems to know an equal lot about war, math, mythology, computers and technology (both of the 40s and the 90s), the Seattle grunge scene, and Cap'n Crunch cereal. Not necessarily all in that order, and that's leaving a lot out because there's not enough space here to write about it all. (Which is why Stephenson's book is almost 1200 pages long.) Then, for good measure (or maybe to show off?) he even makes up a whole fictional community as well. Jeebus, man! Way to make the rest of us look like a bunch of pansy-ass losers.I'm not going to even come close to pretending like I understood everything in this book. I suck at math, and I know the basics of computers, and I don't eat Cap'n Crunch cereal, so really the Seattle grunge scene is all I really have any remote knowledge about, but that doesn't really count since I haven't even been there in person. I'm glad I read this because it was a wild read and I didn't hate it while I was reading it, even if it was over my head at times. There were graphs and illustrations and algorithms and stuff to give it some validity, and maybe someone much smarter than me could make sense of it all. As it was I just enjoyed looking at it and pretending I was learning something through osmosis.This was so much better thanSnow CrashorThe Diamond Age: Or, a Young Lady's Illustrated Primer, but that's entirely personal opinion. This kind of spy stuff is much more exciting to me and makes more of an impression on me than the other two I've read. I'm sort of nerdily excited to readQuicksilverand the rest of the Baroque Cycle now because I guess it has a lot of familiar character names, but I have no idea if they're as good as this one.One star knocked off for being insanely wordy. That may be genius, or it could just be overwriting.
