What can I say about this book. I loved it!!!I would never have picked it up normally but having seen it recently on BBC, a great adaptation by the way, I was interested in learning more. You know the type of stuff I mean, real feelings and inner thoughts that you can only guess at from the screen.I really liked Margaret. She's a very strong character and the family depend on her totally. She's loyal and loving while still being quite a modern woman for her time.She manages Henry very well. Knowing exactly when to push forward with him and when to withdraw. That is until that fateful day. Then afterwards, I think life gets better for her in that regard and she's not so 'careful' with him and he seems to accept it and respect her for it.This is a very prosy book. There are chunks of it which baffled me at times and had me wondering was the man wool gathering while writing it. It could have been shortened a bit and it wouldn't have detracted from the story.So reading this has encouraged me to read more of the classics. I'll definitely try another of his books.
