Forrest Gump is one of those books that I've always wanted to read but worried that I'd seen the movie too many times to approach the story with fresh eyes.But, I walked by it at the library yesterday, decided to check it out, and finished it today. It turns out, the book has very little in common with the movie, and it really stands on its own as a unique story.I loved the movie, but, after reading the book, I see now that the author, Winston Groom, was going for more of a modern retelling of Gulliver's Travels. Forrest Gump of the novel is not the "wide-eyed innocent" as he is portrayed by Tom Hanks. He's rougher around the ages, has multiple encounters with the ladies, and uses words like "shit," and quite a lot. He's also a large man, like Gulliver, and an "idiot savant" rather than just "slow."The story is completely outlandish; it's a tall tale, and it lacks the great nod to Americana that the movie gives, but it's consistent in its Voice, and, though conveyed to the reader through a strong dialect, it is often funny, and, sometimes, heartbreakingly sad.I can't imagine having unleashed such a popular icon as Forrest Gump. It's amazing to think of writers who have accomplished this rare deed. This book reminds me of two other books-turned-into-popular movies: The Wizard of Oz and The English Patient. Why? Because they are well-written stories that were read by visionaries who then transformed them into something different, rather than altered them and ruined them as a film. When that happens, I feel that a novel and movie can stand side by side and not detract from each other's artistic contribution.
