Thank God this is a work of fiction.If the book had even the tiniest modicum of truth it would render trials by jury obsolete.As a work of fiction, it is a very enjoyable read.I enjoyed all the manipulative skulduggery of both the tobacco industries team and to two wunderkinds who are trying to sabotage the tobacco industries attempts to avoid paying a gross amount of compensation to a widow who lost her husband to lung cancer.The lengths that the tobacco magnates are prepared to go to in an effort to corrupt the jury would make the CIA look like a bunch of amateurs. But not to be outdone, the two wunderkinds, one in the jury and the other one on the outside, are just as good at the art of skulduggery.Ridiculous, but really enjoyable.Recommended for readers who like a page turner and don't mind reality being stretched really thin.
