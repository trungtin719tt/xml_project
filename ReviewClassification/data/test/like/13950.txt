Oh my gosh. Why did I do this to myself? Did I just think,"Hey, I haven't cried and felt miserable in a while. I should fix that."Or what?Yeah, normal Jilly doesn't cry. If I'm really upset I'm more likely to spiral into a dark depression and retreat from everyone and everything. You know, like a well-adjusted person. But tears? No, not a thing. Yet, this book brought a few.Maybe the old tear ducts need a good cleaning once in a while. It's probably healthy.Next time, this is how I'll clean them.Anyway, read this one if you want to cry. Or, if you want to get really scared, because truthfully, all of the early signs of Alzheimer's are there for most of us.Forgetting words and using "thingy" in place? CheckForgetting where something is? CheckForgetting what I was looking for or why I came in that room? CheckForgetting to go running? Double and Triple Check. Okay, maybe notforgettingto run exactly, but I don't run. Is that a sign? Do I have it?Hypochondriac kitty shouldn't read this book.To be honest, I didn't really like Alice all that much before she got diagnosed, but her descent into Early Onset Alzheimer's was brutal. Nobody should have to go through that. The story did a great job showing us the horror of losing your mind. And, scaring the ever-loving crap out of me.In other words... Unless you really need to clean those tear ducts, or you know someone going through this and want understanding, you should probably stay away. Read something happy and funny instead.Or, read this story. This looks promising.
