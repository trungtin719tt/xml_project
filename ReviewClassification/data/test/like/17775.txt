When the opening sentence in a book includes the words "he was riding in the Driffield point-to-point" I can say my interest was piqued! Driffield is about 20 miles from where I live and I know it well.So I started this one with a smile and wondered where we were going...We went a long long way from that small Yorkshire town..Jean Paget our main protagonist was working in Malaya at the time the Japanese arrived during WW2 . The Japanese army took many prisoners including Jean and 31 other women and children but having no camp for women made them walk all over the country in the blistering heat to find a suitable place...During this time she met Joe Harman an Australian 'ringer (cowboy if you will) ' serving in the army..This is a wonderful story of heroism, far off places, Australia and Malaya, native people, life and death, love and hardship.I cared for the people in this book, the old solicitor Noel Strachan who tells the story is such a lovely, well drawn character too.As well as the afore mentioned Driffield there are also mentions of Hull (where I live) and Goole which again is place near to me...:)If you've not read A town like Alice I highly recommend it...The book is a little dated, in some respects it reads like watching an old black and white film, (which I love) but it doesn't detract from the story...So 5 lovely shiny stars and a place on my 'books I'm passionate about' shelf...
