This is my first reading of the ancient Greek play. Like so many stories that are part of our cultural consciousness, I thought I was very familiar with the plot but was so wrong. I asked my husband what he knew of Oedipus Rex and he said the same thing I was thinking: man murders his father and marries his mother=oedipus complex ala Dr Sigmund Freud.That, of course, is what happens but the true tragedy is that it was not intended. In the opening scenes of the play, Thebes has been plagued by failing crops, barren women, etc. and the people want to know what has angered their gods. Creon, Queen Jocasta's brother, has sought the advice of an oracle who says King Laius was murdered and they must bring his killer to account, either by exile or death, to make things right again. Tiresias, the blind soothsayer, is brought to court and asked to identify the killer and he names King Oedipus. At first, Oedipus thinks his brother-in-law is involved in a plot to gain the crown for himself. But then the truth begins to slowly come to light as various twists of fate are revealed. The moral of the tragedy seems to be that the fate the gods have planned for a person cannot be avoided.Excellent tale! No wonder it is still so popular after over two thousand years! I look forward to reading the rest of the trilogy now.
