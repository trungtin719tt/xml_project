So an Idaho School District is considering the possibility of banningThe Namesakefrom their high schools reading list.I don't know about other parents, but I trust that my kids are not going to read this beautiful novel and somehow plunge into a life of drug abuse...Also, I might be mistaken since I read it a few years ago, but I don't recall that the use of recreational drugs is an essential part of the plot of this novel...http://www.americanbazaaronline.com/2...
