Charming, ranging, generous, memoir of Paris, stuffed full of memorable lines ("Never Any End to Paris") and packed with the luminaries of the expat era. How weird to read a book where Joyce is just sort of around, where Gertrude Stein and Alice Toklas squabble, and where, in an excellent moment, Fitzgerald's face turns into a death mask while drunk. All along, Hemingway's first marriage to Hadley is at once extolled and mourned. I read the Restored Edition, which in some ways I regret, especially after reading about the interventionist edit and suffering through repetitions, but this is an infectious breeze, one that will infect you with wanderlust. Hemingway is an odd caricature of himself, but there is a charm to his wanton masculinity that makes him hard not to like.
