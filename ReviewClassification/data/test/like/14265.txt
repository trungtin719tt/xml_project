Definitely Dead4 StarsSookie must travel to New Orleans at the Queen of Louisiana's behest to finalize her deceased cousin Hadley's estate. But someone doesn't want her arriving in one piece, and the suspects range from rogue weres to treacherous vampires to Sookie's former lover, Bill Compton. Can Sookie stay alive long enough to find out what's going on?Series note:Hadley's demise is recounted in the very short novellaOne Word Answer, but it is not necessary to read it to follow the events in this installment.In terms of the plot, there are, once again, several intertwining threads that raise the question of how one small yet snarky woman can get into so much trouble in such a short period of time. In addition to a group of newly turned weres who want to turn her into kibble, Sookie finds a severed corpse in her garden and a rabid vampire in a closet.With all of these goings on, it should be difficult for Sookie to even think of having a love life, but our intrepid herione has no problem in this department either. With Calvin, Alcide, Bill and Eric more or less out of the picture, Sookie's new beau is Quinn the huge and hunky tiger shifter. Only time will tell if he is her match made in heaven or hell.All in all, Sookie's adventures are a laugh-riot and should never be taken too seriously. Looking forward to the next one.
