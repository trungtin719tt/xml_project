This book is breath-taking in its suspense.I am not sure if I should call the antagonist, Zobrist, a mad or futuristic person. Like all the antagonists of Brown's novels, he is apparently intelligent.But, to quote Shakespeare -There is method in madness.(fromHamlet.Even the author does not seem to portray the character of Zobrist as a cruel person like his other antagonists. Because, though Zobrist's solution is drastic, the issue of population increase in the world is very real.In this book, the hero and the villain are the same person.
