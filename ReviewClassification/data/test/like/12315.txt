It took me a long time to read this despite being very diligent about it. I rented it from the library, and woe, I had to re-check it out after 2 weeks. It was frustrating because I originally started reading it in order to take up the time it would take for the library to get in the other books I wanted to read. The problem wasn't the story, it was the old-ish language used. The fact that the book was insanely thick with small print didn't help matters either. I do have to say I have grown very fond of the word knave. I will randomly say things like, "What saidst thou, knave." My family probably thinks I'm nuts.Now for my thoughts on the story. I really liked the way the book incorporates the four stories of the Jewess (another word I have grown to like a lot), Ivanhoe, the king, and Cedric. They flow in and out of each other nicely. Rebbecca is the most awesome woman in the book. She defends her chastity with her life. Who among us would do the same? To be honest, I don't think I would. Of course, chastity now is not what it used to be. I read in the prologue that people were originally upset that Ivanhoe and the Jewess were not married in the end. I was happy that Ivanhoe married Rowena instead. It really wouldn't have worked out with the religion thing. I do wish that she had met some great Jewish guy though. She really deserves to be happy. I thought Athelstane was really funny. I don't really know if he was supposed to be used for comic relief or to frustrate the reader, but I always laughed at him. I do have to say that I was kind of glad that he "died." When he came back, I knew that Cedric was going to start with his tricks again, but I'm glad that he didn't avail in the end.
