Those who know me, know that I am not a religious fanatic by any means. Would it be ridiculous to adopt my beliefs in theology from this Anne Rice novel?? This book delves deep into the idea of creationism as well as the eternal struggle between God &amp; the devil since the beginning of time. All of the ideas revealed here were very intriguing and totally believable, despite their grandeur. Perhaps that is why I was so engrossed by the story.I was especially drawn in by the introduction of the devil, who is portrayed in a very different light than he is commonly otherwise known. In this story, the devil reaches out to Lestat, a guilt-ridden immortal soul, who has, in his dark past, committed heinous acts and whose personal constitution disavows any belief in God or the devil, but seeks to repent for his misdoings. It it at this juncture in his life that the devil chooses to reveal to Lestat, the truth about what lies beyond the realm of the living and undead.The devil is prepared to offer Lestat a true sense of salvation if he helps him to prevail in his continual battle with God, which the devil claims that he, himself, is winning. In order to allow Lestat to understand how all things, in heaven &amp; on Earth came to exist, the devil takes him on a poetic sojourn to both heaven &amp; hell.This novel was a beautiful characterization &amp; intrepretation of religious thought. It did not fail to enchant &amp; fascinate me. I only gave it 4 stars because I felt that some of the scenes were a bit too graphic for my taste.
