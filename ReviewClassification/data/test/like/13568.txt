Dr. Pierre Arronaux along with his manservant Conseil and Canadian Harpooner Ned Land are captured and imprisoned inside of the submarine known as the Nautilus after mistaking it for a sea creature and attacking it on the USS American Naval ship The Abraham Lincoln. There they meet the Eccentric and adventurous Captain Nemo who tells them that they are going to remain on board his vessel forever to go on an extraordinary tour under the sea. Will the men be able to ever get home or will they stay on the ship until they die? Can they stop Ned Land before he does anything stupid? Read on and find out for yourself.This was a pretty good and interesting read as well as the first book I have ever read by Jules Verne. I have heard of this book from some of my friends who have loved it and seen the Disney film they came out with which I may watch in the future. I thought the scientific and technical parts were interesting and to go on an underwater tour to see the marine flora and fauna would be awesome to do! If you enjoy classic literature and books about under the sea then be sure to check this book out. It is available to get at your local library and to buy wherever books are sold.
