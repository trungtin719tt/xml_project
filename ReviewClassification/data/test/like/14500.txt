This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I've read and I'll look for another. This book grabbed me from the first chapter, clearly written and intriguing characters and, even though I had a pretty good idea of where the plot was going and didn't really have any surprises, I still really enjoyed the story and how it was told.Logan Thiebault is a great character and I really wanted him to find his way and his HEA. Without too much detail, his experiences as a marine and how that affected his life were well-told and made him an easier character to understand, even the idea that he didn't really quite understand himself was easy to believe. His dog Zeus was a nice addition to his story, the fact that the dog was truly his best friend. I'm glad I took the time to read this one.
