The actual plot is... Just Pratchett really, a plucky yet reluctant hero/ine must save the day as reality itself is being royally buggered through the power of magic and a maniac villain, etc, while we have vignettes of the best and brightest of the Unseen University acting their usual selfish, gluttonous and dim selves, etc, etc. Perfectly enjoyable and the antagonist feels especially malevolent this time, though I still can't decide if Susan Sto Heilt is a troubled woman desperate for normalcy or just a shitty Granddaughter.What makes this book an utterly delightful piece of Holiday literature is the side story, involving a seven foot skeleton with a pillow shoved under hisSantaHogfather outfit, riding through the sky on a pig drawn sleigh beside a stubbled, alcoholic 'elf' and a magical gift sack, with a plan to bring Hogwatch cheer to the land as best they can. These scenes are ridiculously cosy, sentimental and funny, with lessons about what children really want for Christmas, the crassness of certain types of charity, a barrage of Chrimbo imagery and 'the true meaning of the season'. I wouldn't really blame you if you missed every section that didn't feature Death in it, and I'll probably end up doing just that next year to get me in the Christmas mood (because having to listen toFairy Tale of New Yorkin November sure as shit won't do that for me).
