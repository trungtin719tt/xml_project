In Secret Vampire Poppy is diagnosed with terminal cancer soon after summer vacation starts. Her best friend James is a vampire of the Night World. He can save her by making her immortal, breaking the two basic rules of the Night World: don't fall in love with a human, and don't tell a human about the Night World.In Daughters of Darkness three vampire sisters leave their isolated home to live with their aunt in a rural town. Their brother Ash is sent to track them down, but falls in love with their new human friend.In Spellbinder two witches fight over a human boy at their new school, using black and white magic.I read this book after reading the Twilight series and it kind of reminds me of that. The writing is a little simplistic, but it's written for teens. The stories are good enough that the writing style can be overlooked, and it's easy to follow. I really enjoyed watching the different relationships play out. The first two stories deal with vampires, which I'm a big fan of. The third is about witches, and even though I don't really like witch stories, I found this one to be an enjoyable read. The laws of Night World are very strict, and anyone that breaks the laws is sentenced to death. This puts an urgency into the storyline as each character must choose how far their willing to go for true love. I'll definitely be picking up the rest of the Night World series.
