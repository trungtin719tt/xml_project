This is the most stunning, life-changing book. I am a Bible fan, and so I am quite familiar with the principles taught by Jesus Christ. This book is a similar book, but it was written by prophets in the ancient Americas, instead of Palestine/Middle-East area.The prophets likewise taught of the coming of Jesus Christ, and lobbied for improved Christian morals among the people, and were lead by the Spirit of Lord.I find the language very New Testament (Old English) style, but very clear, and its easy to cross-reference with the Bible (since there are cross-references throughout).I have actually read this book a number of times, and I actually am not getting tired of it. It seems to invite the Spirit of God into my day, so I have been reading it in the morning. Its a very inspiring book. I highly recommend it.
