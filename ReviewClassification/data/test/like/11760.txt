I have been meaning to read this book for a long time so I decided to tackle the 600+ pages this week.I loved the film and enjoyed the book almost as much. I have read that there is a debate as to how much of the story is Charriere's own experiences but nevertheless it makes a great read.Even though some of the adventures do take a lot of believing he obviously lived an extraordinary life and this book is well worth reading.
