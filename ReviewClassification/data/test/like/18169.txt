"The Life and Deeds of Alexis Zorba" (as it was originally titled in Greek) does not follow the form of a conventional novel. The plot is simplistic: it is the story of a young idealistic scholar and his friend, cook, and foreman Alexis Zorbas who go to Crete to embark on a lignite mining scheme. The content, however, is at once a compelling snapshot of early 20th-century life in Greece and a profound Socratic discourse on the meaning of love, life, and living. "Zorba" requires patience--one must understand that its progression resembles an afternoon at a Cretan taverna more than a walk down 5th avenue--but when read with care, it will change your life."Boss, everything's simple in the world. How many times must I tell you? So don't go and complicate things!"
