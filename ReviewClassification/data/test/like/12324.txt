I came to feel like the contour bird. I wanted to fly around the Sierra foothills backward, just looking. If there was no longer any sense in pretending to be interested in where I was going, I could consult where I've been.From myangle of repose,this book grew on me slowly, a sprawl of words initiated from a cinch slate of exposition that grew and expanded into layered lushness, much like the frontier-era American West Stegner writes about. Swollen with depth and complexity, the story of Susan and Oliver is told from the perspective of their grandson, Lyman, a fifty-eight-year-old retired historian bound to a wheelchair, unable to move his body because of bone disease. Lyman's wife has deserted him for his doctor. Studying his grandmother's letters and recreating their family history and legacy, affords Lyman a daily routine and something to look forward to each day, something to keep his mind off the pain. And Susan Ward, his grandmother, is an illuminating character. A successful artist and art lover, she finds herself in the middle of the uncivilized West with her engineer husband, Oliver, who will start and lose many jobs on his quest to becoming successful. They will fall in love, raise a family in shacks across the country, lose optimism along the way, and still maintain a 60-year marriage, despite setbacks. Years later, their grandson would trace the history of their love, life and travels through letters that his grandmother wrote to her best friend.What really interests me is how two such unlike particles clung together, and under what strains, rolling downhill into their future until they reached the angle of repose where I knew them. That's where the interest is. That's where the meaning will be if I find any.This novel, whose excerpts are taken directly from Mary Hallock Foote's real letters, won the Pulitzer Prize for fiction in 1972. How befitting that the father of Stanford Writing Program writes so beautifully and profoundly of his deeply loved western center of America. As usual when I read his novels, I find a piece of myself within one of his characters. Like Virginia Woolf inNight and Day, he reminds me that feeling simpatico with a character transcends race, culture and place. In fact, transcendence of time is what this novel does well. Susan and Oliver strive for a dream that would outlive them and find itself in their legacy, in their offspring and the offsprings of those who make a living through them. They traverse the West, taking risks that not too many couples have and despite their heartbreaks and turmoil, they create a historical legacy that leaves a mark in places they've been, a legacy which through their grandson, becomes transcendent. Their love, their relationship, transcends time.
