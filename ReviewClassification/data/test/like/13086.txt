Spoiler Free Review4.5 STARS out of 5Genre: YA Paranormal RomanceSeries: Book #4 in Hush Hush Series'Scott didn't like the answer he kept coming back to.If Nora had done this-If Patch had helped her-It didn't matter how carefully they'd covered their tracks. They'd miss something. Everyone always did. It was only a matter of time.'~Inner monologue of ScottFinalestarts with Nora stepping up as leader of the Nephilim. Well trying to at least, she is met with heavy opposition. Not only is it widely known that she is dating a fallen angel. Patch. Nobody understands why the black hand appointed her "a human" suddenly turned a Nephilim to take his place. Needless to say she is not trusted or accepted amongst the Nephilim. And this is not good because Cheshvan is approaching. (Unfortunately fallen angels do not have the ability to feel. At all, not kisses, touches, cold, hot or pain they get nothing. Cheshvan is the one time of year angels can posses the Nephilim after forcing them to swear fealty. Then and only then are they able to feel via their Nephilim vessel.)"You have to choose Nora. You can't be loyal to us and Patch. You're making an admirable go of it, but in the end, loyalty is about taking a side. You're either with the Nephilim or against us."~DantePatch and Nora may have killed Hank but that has nothing on what they are up against now. Nora made an oath that could cost her and her mothers life if she does not lead the Nephilim against the fallen angels. Which means War, so in order to carry out the oath she must destroy all fallen angels. This is clearly not an option because she is in love with Patch.'I'd lost Patch before, and not to be melodramatic, but death was preferable. Patch was in my life for a reason. I needed him. We were two halves of the same whole.'~Inner monologue of NoraNora and Patch stage a break-up to convince the Nephilim she is 100% on their side, while Patch finds out everything he can about the fallen angels plans. Nora will work within the Nephilim. Of course not everything goes as planned. In fact things take such a bad turn I was unsure how Nora and Patch would survive."You're a strong girl, and your mine. But strength doesn't always mean brute force. You don't have to kickass to be a fighter. Violence doesn't equal strength. Lead your army by example. There's a better answer to all this. War isn't going to solve anything, but it will tear our two worlds apart, and there will be casualties, including humans. There's nothing heroic about this war. It will lead to destruction unlike anything you have ever seen."~Patch to NoraThoughtsLots of twist and turns in this book. We get a few new characters and Dabria makes some annoying appearances. Seriously, I hate that chick. Marcie was... well Marcie. And Vee really stepped up, I wish we could have gotten a little more of her. While I personally would have liked some more romance I still was satisfied due to the plot-lines which had more twist than a damn pretzel. I quickly zeroed in on the characters and the story and was left SHOCKED quite a few times. And the ending....I LOVED IT!!!This series has allowed Becca Fitzpatrick to carve a nice spot in YA-PNR and I will continue tot read her work. She is an author that can pull you in to her world with the snap a finger. I highly recommend this series to anyone who enjoys YA-PNR's.My RatingsCharacters- Patch and Nora are Lovable but I hated a lot of the othersWriting Style- GoodPlot/Storyline- Suspenseful with lots of twist and turnsSteam Factor- PG-13Overall- I loved it!
