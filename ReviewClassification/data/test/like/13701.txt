From the first chapter this story gripped me and hardly let me put it down! Though there's nothing really happy or pretty about this story, the way Yates tells it is masterful. It's all about the hypocrisy of the American dream and how poisonous it and masculinity can be. There aren't any likeable characters here, really, and there isn't supposed to be. Yates examines the post WWII, suburban haven we now think back on with nostalgia, but which during the day rarely came close to its superficial happiness. I loved this book so much, the in-depth character and culture study it provided. This is an odd sort of book to recommend, but if you're interested in the psychology of characters and want it presented to you in excellent writing, read Revolutionary Road.
