This was far more engaging than The Stand and better written. That is my opinion. I was engaged from the first chapter. I might have cried a little at the end of the book. My heart was in my throat at the beginning of the novel with the vivid description of a nuclear holocaust. There is no war, it is just the end of everything. The various stories of survival of our characters, "good and "bad", kept me reading. It touched my claustrophobia in a way that I had to stop reading for a few minutes here and there. I liked the supernatural bits, they did not detract from or make the story seem silly or over the top. I would recommend this to anyone who might like to read about the end of the world. I am glad I finally read it.
