WHO AM I?Where is the Jess that hated the first book in this series?Oh, I know where she is.She's in the man dungeon, with Rhage, learning how wrong about things she was.Rhage.Hubba hubba."I know all about you, and everything I see is beautiful. Everything I see is mine.""I'm not yours.""Fine. If I can't have you, then you do the taking. Have all of me, part of me, a small piece, whatever you want. Just please, have something."Seriously, this book? Blew the first one out of the water.Me likey.Sure, I'm totally against what happened in the middle there.(view spoiler)[THERE IS NEVER AN EXCUSE FOR GOING OUT AND BANGING OTHER WOMEN I DON'T CARE WHAT SORT OF CURSE YOU HAVE, YOU FIND ANOTHER WAY.(hide spoiler)]And I side-eyed the hell out of some things, but I was able to let most of it go and just enjoy this for what it was. A smut-filled escapade with a dragon-vampire-man and his lady friend who happens to be dying of Leukemia."I'm not a man, Mary, even though parts of me look like one. What you just had is nothing compared to what I want to do to you. I want my head between your legs so I can lick you until you scream my name. Then I want to mount you like an animal and look into your eyes as I come inside of you. And after that? I want to take you every way there is. I want to do you from behind. I want to screw you standing up, against the wall, I want you to sit on my hips and ride me until I can't breathe."I can't give full points because the story didn't actually end - and I skipped every single lesser section because they are the actual worst. But overall,Rhage got that magic peen that makes me forget to rhage about things.Bring on Z's book. My body is ready.4let-me-feed-you-maryStarsThanks for the buddy readHeather!
