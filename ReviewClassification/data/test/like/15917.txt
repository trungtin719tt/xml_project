This is a book that celebrates the introverts among us. While Ferdinand's bull brethren wrestle each other, in hopes of being chosen to represent at the bullfights in Madrid, Ferdinand likes to just sit under the cork oak, and to observe the lovely flowers. Ferdinand's mom is worried about him, but she comes to realize that he isn't unhappy; he just rather enjoys spending a lot of time alone.I do wish that Ferdinand had some friends, as his complete withdrawal from the world resembles schizoid personality disorder, perhaps more than introversion, per se. Surely he could have found a bull friend to observe the wonders of nature with him?...maybe he just needed to move to different town and find more like-minded folks.Anyway, Ferdinand eventually gets chosen as el toro for la corrida. Leaf, IMHO, does a Hemingwayesque job of describing the wondrous spectacle of bullfighting, without altogether shying from representing its ruthless provocation and violence. Flags fly, the bands play, banderillos march with their ribbons and pins, mounted picadores trot in with their spears,and the dashing red-caped matador bows to the ladies. While bullfighting doesn't work out well for our dear Ferdinando, we, as Michael Stipe says, all go back to where we belong, and our bull eventually gets to return to his cork tree to watch the flowers forevermore.
