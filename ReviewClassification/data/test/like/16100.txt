The guardian is another great book by Nicholas Sparks. Though I must say he has done better work I still enjoyed reading this one. Like the majority of his books the sadness of death is expressed through his writing. I must say though, at the beginning of the book the story was pretty slow and didn't completely have my attention unlike say The Last Song or Dear John. But by the middle of the book it had me completely captivated! I just couldn't put it down. The whole mysterious Richard story and true self becoming unveiled. It is also not just about love between people, but the bond between a girl and her dog. It tells about the true loyalty and friendship between Julie and her dog Singer. And how he fought tp save her to the very end. This book though slow in the beginning was pretty good and I recommend it to others whom enjoy thrillers, with romance etc.
