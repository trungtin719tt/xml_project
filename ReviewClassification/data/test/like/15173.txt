4.5 stars.Pretty much from start to finish, I adored All Together Dead. Sure the reveals in it were pretty damn glaring but I definitely was entertained. It was interesting how Harris wrote it with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. It certainly brought more dire circumstances for the Louisiana group at the summit.Sookie's romantic life wasn't holding this book down at all, it's quite obvious, at least to me, who she's meant to be with. ERIC. Judging by his actions/comments and even Pam's comments, he cares deeply for Sookie. There are some telling signs from Sookie as well. Overall, I gotta say they have the best chemistry. I can't see how they wouldn't end up together, no matter that Quinn seems like a nice guy.Quinn's history is finally told, why he's so well known (and even awed) among the supes. It's pretty tragic and I do hope he gets a happy ending with his love life, that is unless Harris decides to assassinate his character or something a la Bill, LOL. Just to note, I do think he and Sookie make a nice couple but I don't think it'll work out.Bubba was not in here besides a passing mention but Pam had her largest appearance ever so that did tide me over. I continue to think it's hilarious and awesome that she backs Eric/Sookie. I mean I know it's loyalty to her master, she wants him happy but part of me thinks she believes they make perfect sense as well. Besides her interest in Sookie's love life, readers finally hear who Pam was before she turned and how she came to meet Eric. That background was long overdue, let me tell ya.Barry the bellboy from Living Dead in Dallas appears with a bigger role as telepath to Stan, the now King of Texas. He and Sookie kind of bond over their shared abilities. I thought it was nice for Sookie to have someone like him to talk to and experiment with. I enjoyed their friendship and hope they can get closer together since in this book they ended with differing choices.The different plots were great. I still believe that non-Bon Temps locations provide the more exciting and action-packed stories. New supes introduced, suicidal assassins, traitors, vampire judicial cases, misplaced caskets and luggage, a mysterious multiple vampire murder, weddings, blood exchanges...fun, fun stuff.
