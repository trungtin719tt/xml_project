The Christmas reading par excellence!A CLASSIC RE-IMAGINED ONCE AND AGAINI can't tell how many times I have watched some adaptation or another of this classic story......Bugs Bunny, Mickey Mouse, Kermit the Frog, the Real Ghostbusters, live action films, animated TV specials, etc......since this is one of the most adapted stories of all time.A truly Christmas classic.And this one of the few books that I think one hardly can deny that it's the novel that defines a genre, in this case:Christmas.In popular genres like Science-Fiction and Horror, there are several books competing for the title of the lead book in the genre.While in other genres like mafia, we haveThe Godfather; and in epic fantasy we haveThe Lord of the Rings, that there is a more common acceptance that those books are the lead ones on each genre.And certainly, in books about Christmas, the impact and relevance ofA Christmas Carol, not only put the season back in the conscience of people but define the very spirit and message of the holidays.CHARACTER REDEMPTIONEbenezer Scrooge got into the fields of the most popular book characters ever.And indeed, a key factor for a book character to become effective with the readers is change, since any character that ends quite in the same state that he/she started on the beginning of the story, hardly can be named as a good book character. And Scrooge changesa lotin this story, so he didn't only became a popular character but the embodiment of a type of human personality.Humbug!I was so familiar with the story that I could "tell" it to anyone by memory, however I never actually read the original book.I knew the story only from the several adaptations in media.So, I thought that it was a very good moment to read the classic novel.I loved it.First, I didn't know that the chapters weren't named like that but instead, Dickens opted to named them "staves" since it was a "carol" (xmas song) what he was writing.Moreover, the division of the story is just perfect since Dickens used the right number of "staves" to tell the story, denoting the perfect structure of the storytelling.Great details that you only get on the reading experience of the story.Also, not only I re-experienced yet again the immortal story but I met some details that I didn't recall to be mentioned in the adaptations that I have watched.(view spoiler)[One of the spookiest details that I met on the reading was the mention that Marley's Ghost had been present in the company of Scrooge basically every night since his death, but only until that moment he was able to be visible in front of him. The very notion of living in a mansion where a ghost acompanies you every night without your knowledge is way scary! Also, I found quite interesting and impacting the part of the "children" named "Ignorance" and "Want". I don't remember to know about those details in the media adaptations. So, it was priceless to know "new" facts about a story that I have met so many times in my life.(hide spoiler)]So, even if you have watched so different versions of the classic tale as me, if you have the chance of actually reading the book, please, give it a chance, you won't regret it!God bless us, everyone!And Merry Christmas!
