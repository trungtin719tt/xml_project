I was totally mesmerized by the Mary Poppins books as a child and I remember sitting in the library (it was a kind of nursery for me with my mum being the librarian :) reading and re-reading them any time I could get my hands on them (they were popular and in demand - not easy to get).Still felt the allure while reading it as an adult: a nice, cosy walk down Memory lane.
