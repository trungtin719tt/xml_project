My apologies to Olivia, I know you weren't blown away by Action Barbie and her gang of new friends, but OMG I loved this.Another one of those books I can't read in public. Not because it's full of smut, but because I constantly feel like making out with my Kindle.That'show much I loved reading this book. I was constantly grumpy for the past few days, without having a real reason.Conversations with me pretty much went like this:Person: Kim?Me:WHAT?So after having to reanimate a few of thosepersonsI put 2 and 2 together and realized it was because I felt anxious every moment I wasn't reading this book.There was not one dull chapter in this book, I kept wanting to find out what would happen next. I love how certain questions were left unanswered, questions that a lot of other series already elaborately explain in the first book.I'm not very girly myself so I don't really get the whole pink thing, but it didn't bother me. (I was lucky enough to keep Alicia Silverstone out of my head during the entire book!) I heard a some things about Mac before I read this and I was expecting I would hate her guts. But nope. Love her. I even felt bad because I laughed during her encounters with V'lane. The first one was just funny, the second one was... um... I'm trying to find a way to describe this without giving anything away... I don't know... I read that part and tried to imagine myself in Mac'sposition. I'm sure my low levels of feeling horrified don't even come close to what it must be like.I pretty much went into high school crush mode the moment I met Barrons (but I didn't know why yet, and I'm still not sure if I have a reason). I'm so intrigued, I feel like bursting out of my skin. I'mthisclose to booking a flight to Ireland. I'll even swim if I have to.I would dive into the second book this instant if I wasn't reading 3 other books already, but if I don't force myself to read those first, I'll spend all my time reading this series. And maybe it's not a bad idea to drag this out a bit. I might have to give my Kindle to somebody so I can't start readingBloodfever. But I don't want to end up in jail for assault and battery, or even manslaughter, 'cause I'll know I'll say "don't let me have my Kindle underanycircumstances" and then regret it 3 seconds later.*dreamy sigh* Oh Barrons. Where have you been all my life?
