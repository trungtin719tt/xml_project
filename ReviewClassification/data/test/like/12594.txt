Second read in 2018:In my opinion, this is a modern classic. A heartwarming read about a pre-teen girl in a small town in Florida, living with her dad. She is growing up without a mom and has recently moved to a new town and feels a little lost.This is a powerful read about family, community, love, friendship, loss, and a wonderful dog who ties it all together. It will make you laugh and cry. Please give this book a try. I promise it will touch your heart. The audio and book, six stars each. Yes it was written for middle grade readers but there are some wonderful books in this category and it shouldn't be discounted. I really need to read every single one of Kate DiCamillo's books because I've loved every one I've tried.First read in 2014:Before GR, I used to think children's books were just for children. How off base was that? This is a lovely story that will make you laugh and cry. There are universal themes of love, friendship and family, and the love of a pet. I really think authorKate DiCamillois special, as I've loved three of her books, all written for children. It takes a special gift to be able to appeal equally to kids and adults, and she has it.Don't pass this one by because it's a kid's book. You'd be missing out. I listened to this the whole way through; never read the paper book at all. I can highly recommend the audio performance as well. Just what I was looking for: a book to remind me that there's good everywhere, and you just need to keep your eyes out and look for it. Thank you, Ms. DiCamillo.
