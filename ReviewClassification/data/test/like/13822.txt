****MANY SPOILERS!*****This is one of my favorites out of the whole trilogy! I found it really hard to make it through without getting teary-eyed when Zane died ecspecially since I could almost feel Tally's pain the way Westerfeld wrote about it and since Zane had had the surgery so Tally wouldn't be disgusted with her anymore. I found it interesting when Maddy found a cure for being special but Tally once again fought her way out of it. It was a big shocker to me when the person saving Tally from being de-specialized was Doctor Cable but once it was explained, I understood. She didn't want her best work to go away forever or in other words, her special specials.
