I'm currently reading this book, I was at the library and just picked it up not really knowing what it was about. Anyway, as soon as I started reading it I couldn't stop. It's one of those books that you cant put down. Infact I have been late for school a few days because I stay up so late reading it.It's not a very large book. But the story is incredible!From what i've read so far it is about a girl who lives in a strange city called Ember, where there is no such thing as the sun. The whole city is lit by lights. Because 300 years ago, people called the builders decided to create the place. Ember is now in danger of dying away, because all the supplies are running out (the builders built giant storage places and filled them with supplies) And nobody knows how to make anything themselves. Another problem is the generator, recently their have been frequent power failures that last only minutes, but without the power their is no way to see, or do anything. Then one day the main girl finds a strange letter that seems to have been written by the builders. I wont say anymore, as to not spoil it.
