This is sort of like a "greatest hits" collection of Lovecraft: all his well-known stories are here, like "The Call of Cthulu" and "At the Mountains of Madness." Reading these stories back to back, though, you start to notice a few things; the racism and xenophobia is hard to miss, but also, most of these stories have the same plot. Lovecraft changes the setting and nature of the horror in each story but after reading a few you can pretty much predict how each story is going to go because they all follow the same pattern and narrative structure. I almost sprung for a collection of all Lovecraft's stories, but I'm glad I stuck with this one.
