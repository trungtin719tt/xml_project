The Man in the High Castle by Philip K. Dick, winner of the Hugo Award for best novel, is classic, very good science fiction.It is the story of a segmented and defeated United States after the Axis powers won World War II. This alternate history actually began in the thirties as Roosevelt is described as having been assassinated. Taking a roving perspective amidst several characters and some loosely connected interwoven storylines, PKD explores a world where America is divided into three distinct sections and controlled by either Japan or Germany.The story also explores racism as well as common PKD themes of confused realities and subjective perceptions. Most interestingly is that there is a book within the book, written by the man in the high castle, where the allies won the war.
