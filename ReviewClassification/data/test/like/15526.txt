***Spoilers***Well, I am thrilled that Eric and Sookie's relationship is back, sorta. But nothing is really ever how it appears in this series, and none of their time together seemed 100% normal to me, like there was something important we still need to know. The more blood they exchanged the more I worried that Eric will end up dying at some point. I hope not :( Although he is controlling to a degree that would piss me off royally in the real world...it fits his personality and job description as sheriff so well that its hard to question, anything else would be against his nature. I think Harris is slowly evolving him into his deep feelings for Sookie.Bill...ugh. Is it sad part of me was hoping he WAS dead at the end? I just want to see what direction the series would go if Sookie WAS attached to someone (by someone I mean Eric of course), and the endless circle of "who will it be?" was over.I am so sad Claudine and Trey Dawson are dead; Sookie needs all the allies she can get.All right, now that is done. Time to wait another year for #10...
