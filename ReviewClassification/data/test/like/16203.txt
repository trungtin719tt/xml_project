How that I'm working in a bookshop, I need to be familiar with books that we sell often, like this series. And my coworker and friend told me they were fun. And oh boy, she was right. I highly enjoyed this!It is a fun series with adventure and a bit of a fantasy element, like LOTR junior but with a completely different setting and much more speed and events and adventures. It is 12+, but suitable and fun for any age. (Technically, my age of 27 is 12+, of course :P) very suitable for boys, but of course also a fun read for girls.My library has an app for audiobooks, and this one (and the rest of the series!) are available there. I love this, because this is included in my membership anyway. When i bike to work (half an hour), I'm able to listen and thus read a book while I would have listed to random music otherwise. I love this, more reading time!I enjoyed the book and I enjoyed it in this format. of course, if I'd read it, it would have taken me less time. But I listed to this on moments I was not able to read a book (have you ever tried reading a book and driving a bike at the same time? BAD idea), so it feels like this is an extra read or something.I will definitely continue this series!
