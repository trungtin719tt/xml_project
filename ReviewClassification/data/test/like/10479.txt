Oh man. Lover Eternal just breaks my heart. Rhage and Mary are exceptional characters. Together, they are mesmerizing. Who knew that a womanizing warrior like Rhage could love someone like Mary. They are so different from one another. What I also loved was the fact that Mary was a little hesistant with Rhage. She didn't just fall into his arms because of his looks and reputation. She is a smart woman who sticks to the truth about life, which is that it only happens once. With her health on the line, Mary takes cautious steps in this book where she learns to trust and love someone else.Mary and Rhage just may be my favourite couple of the BDB so far. Their love was believeable and if put in the same position as Rhage was, I think I would make the same decision he did. Thank the Virgin Scribe for her compassionate heart, that's all I have to say. This book is truly a happily ever after, and it couldn't have happened to a better couple.Favourite Quote:Butch came around in front, twisting his shirt he'd taken off into a rope. Thanks to all the lifting they'd been doing, the male's chest and arm muscles were thickening up, and he hadn't been small to begin with. He couldn't pull the kind of iron Rhage did, but for a human, the guy was a bulldozer."You're getting into some kind of shape, cop.""Aw come on now." Butch grinned. "Don't let that shower we took go to your head."p. 117,
