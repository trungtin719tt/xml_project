Ever intimate in tone, Shakespeare's sonnets reflect upon the relationship between love and power, in addition to considering the many forms attempts to ward off oblivion might take. Most of the sonnets are addressed to the so-called Fair Youth (1-126), some to the Dark Lady (127-154), but all the sonnets share strikingly similar thematic and formal concerns, to the point at which the two sequences read as variations on the same set of topics. So many of the sonnets express simple thoughts, but Shakespeare's melodic language and inventive metaphors make them pleasurable to read.
