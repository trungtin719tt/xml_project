i found this book at a salvation army when i was 17, i had no idea who sartre was, i just liked the description on the back and it sounded really depressing which i was into at the time. i kept trying to read it for the next five years but could never get past the first ten pages or so because it would just bum me out too much.i finally read it when i had just graduated from college. i'm glad that i waited that long because i don't think i would have gotten the joke until then. in much the same way that i'm glad i didn't start listening to the smiths until i was out of highschool. like i would have just taken it all too seriously before that point in time. now i listen to the smiths to cheer myself up. if you get that then you'll love this book.
