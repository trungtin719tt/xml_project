When I learned about Helen Keller, the impression I was given of her was that her life was ~so miserable~ until she was graciously granted a teacher who showed her the world and how to communicate. This book posits Helen's life as that of a blessing, one where she had moments of hardship, but she still felt guided by an excitement for life and experiencing new things rather than being revolted by them.This book was so fascinating because it painted a different picture of a historical figure I thought I knew. It also reveals the extent of Helen's absolute genius to be able to learn and communicate as extensively as she did despite her disabilities. That Helen was so intelligent and driven to learn was really inspiring, and I liked listening to this on audio.
