This a book which has two stories (Princip's journey and the author's journey)being told simultaneously while a third story (the author's time in Bosnia and Herzegovina during the war in 1990s) acts as a filler.Since the author didn't travel a conflict zone like his previous two books,you may not enjoy the slow pace (for which I am docking a star) with lots of history.But this book tells about one serious attempt to find out "who was Gavrilo Princip?".There is a lot of material in the book which you are not taught in history classes.Furthermore alongside Princip we also come to know a lot about Bosnia and Herzegovina.Some parts in the book are boring while some take us back to 1914.All in all it is a must read for those having an interest in history's greatest assasin.
