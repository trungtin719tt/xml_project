This book was amazing! See my full review onhttp://www.msjmentions.blogspot.com.From the very beginning, I loved this novel. I loved the concept. I loved the characters. I loved realizing that my students would love this and that it would be a wonderful tie in with teaching about the brain and even theme in literature.I have honestly been telling all of my friends that they are required to read this book. I even have one committed to doing so! YES!OK, the first thing that I want to mention is how realistic the characters are. For example, near the beginning of this book, Bernard moons his whole class. I've actually been mooned by a student. Another thing that you come to expect as a teacher is that students often think creatively when we expect them to think more logically. In my two years as a teacher, I have learned not to ask why a student does something. They either won't know or I really don't want to know. Bernard is a perfect example of this aspect of junior high.As previously stated, I loved the concept of this book and that it can be used to teach theme. In a sentence, the theme could easily be stated as "It is important to use both creative and logical thinking." This theme is blatantly obvious throughout the entire book. Heck, Bernard is on a mission to save Floyd from only thinking logically! I think that this is an important concept for middle school individuals to consider. It is difficult to mature into adulthood while maintaining a healthy level of creative thinking. I love that this book will inspire children to keep that part of their thinking alive.I strongly urge you to read this book! Please let me know what you think!
