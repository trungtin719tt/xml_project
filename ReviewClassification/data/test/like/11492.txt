"For magic consists in this, the true naming of a thing."- Ursula K Le Guin, A Wizard of EarthseaI rarely venture into YA fiction. Less often still do I pick up and read a book of fantasy. There are exceptions. When I trust the author, we I think there is art/beauty/originality lurking there, I will often venture into spaces and places I usually avoid. Ursula K Le Guin died last year and I started reading her bit by bit, largely focusing on her Hainish novels/cycle. I needed more women in my 2019 plan, and Saga Press recently (on the 50th aniversary of the publishing of Book 1 [this book]) published a wonderful omnibus, illustrated, edition:The Books of Earthsea: The Complete Illustrated Edition. So, I figured I might as well get into the Earthsea boat and give it a go.I loved it. I didn't read much YA fiction when I was a kid. I've read more with my own kids when they were younger, but mostly skipped over this stuff. At the time, I'd rather read Bradbury or Vonnegut. My sister-in-law drives me nuts with her books with swords and dragons. I usually ignore the pulp. But THIS. This is great stuff. It is essentially a Bildungsroman with Taoist elements (equalibrium, etc). It is carefully plotted and spare. She isn't flitting around talking too much about the dragon or the gold and jewel -strung lair of the dragon. She weaves a story about very human things: jealousy, fear, guilt, pride, friendship. The risk was worth it. The journey to other islands in this fantasy archipeligo will continue. I also think it is strangely fitting I finished it on Epiphany (bring on the Mages/Magi).
