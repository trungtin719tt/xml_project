I am a fan of this series. I haven't caught up yet- I think the next I will be reading is Cold Days. Many of my goodread friends are also Harry Dresden fans and there seems to be a general acknowledgement that the first three books are good but the series gets better over time. I've always agreed with that. Then audible had an offer on Stormfront and as I had heard good stuff about the narrator for this series, I jumped in for a reread.Well- this was fantastic the second time round. I remember when I first read this, I wasn't completely sold on the faeries or Bob. But now I realise with hindsight how brilliant the first book is! It's all here right in the first book.Harry Dresden: his skills, his wish to do what is right and good., his chivalry, his practical applications of magic, the faulty technical equipment around him... All this, plus the realisation of how far he progresses as the story line continues through the series.I had to upgrade this to a 5 star read. Urban fantasy doesn't really get much better than this.
