It was disquieting to read this Edwardian classic again after a lapse of over fifty years. Incidents I had remembered so vividly turned out to have happened differently (I was so sure Mr Wilcox had told Leonard Bast to leave the Porphyrian directly, not Helen's passing his remark along) and that the final scene was Charles killing Bast. I felt it is still an excellent anatomy of social class on the eve of the First World War. I also felt the characters were less like real people than cultural projections. The Schlegels perfectly exemplify Mathew Arnold's Hellenes, the Wilcox's the Philistines, and Leonard Bast desperately trying to transform himself into a Hellene but dragged down into the Populace by Jacky - a wonderfully vulgar creation. It also reinforced my belief that Forster burned out early as a novelist because he was morally and spiritually a very shallow person, though very well intentioned and high-minded.
