Kinda disappointed.(view spoiler)[I love Tahereh Mafi, but it is clear that world-building and action-writing are not her strong suits. The action scenes felt rushed. Anderson died too fast and too easily. We didn't get to witness a large-scale epic war. The ending provided no real closure to the story. What happens to Juliette after she killed Anderson? How will a 17-year-old girl with barely a middle school education lead a global movement, let alone governing any country?(hide spoiler)]I wanted more.However, Warner, Kenji, and Juliette's emotional maturity almost made up for the things that lacked.About Warner:Dear Kenji:Hey, Juliette:And Adam:Edit after cover reveal:WOWOWOWOWOWOW I can't believe our "Ignite Me" guess was right! Good job Shatter Me fandom.Original:Here's an interesting observation: I've noticed that the titles Shatter Me, Destroy Me, and Unravel Me are all referring to the manners of what Juliette does to Warner. In Destroy me Warner said: "That this girl would know exactly how toshatter me." Then he went on and said in Unravel Me: "Youdestroy me." In addition to that, Juliette, also in Unravel Me, related to the term when thinking about Warner: "I want tounravel him."So....is it delusional to hope for the seemingly impossible?
