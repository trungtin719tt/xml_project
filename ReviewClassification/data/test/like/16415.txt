The Ocean at the End of the Lane by Neil Gaiman is a fantasy in theThe Graveyard Booksection of his cannon, with Young Adult elements but written for adults.LikeAmerican Gods, the book explores mythos and ancient mysteries and Gaiman is in rare form with a subject matter that resounds with disconnects between our mature selves and our inner child. Gaiman approaches the supernatural in his story in much the same way as Jo Walton did inAmong Others, using minimalism and a subtle shift in perspective.In many respects, Gaiman has become a fantasy writer in the tradition of Ray Bradbury. This was a very good read.
