Speechless!The Maze Runner was the first survival-dystopian book I've ever read and I can't express the pulse-pounding rush I get from this series and what brought other book of this genre come to life in my world.The Hunger Games, Divergent, Legend...it all started with James Dashner and I'll forever be grateful for his ingenious story telling that is 100% pure adrenaline. It ignited a passion in me that will forever be craved.The Death Cureis the finally conclusion to this heart-stopping world and I'm here to tell you that it's been onehelluvaride!!Now...I'm sure that with the ending we got that many people will feel either content with it or they may feel robbed.Me? I guess I feel a little of both, but I think that's how we're meant to feel, cause that's how these characters feel. See, these books are designed to keep the reader in constant wonderment. We don't know who to trust (with a few exceptions) we don't know what's real and we don't know which way the story will turn no matter how much we think we've figured it out. The methods WICKED used were horrendous and when push comes to shove, meaningless. After all that tragic, all that pain and all that torture (for characters and readers alike) the final answer was indeedright before our eyes...and yet, I've neveronce, during this entire series thought about it. I was to focused on what was going on and to panicked with want for my favorite characters to survive that I never looked at the could-be-solution.I was just waiting for the shucking cure!With that said, I'm happy with the way this ended. In fact, I think it's the perfect ending. It's filled with action and answers. It leaves the characters and the readers exhausted and exhilarated, but most of all despite the lost and despair it leaves us with hope, and that my friend is always a note I like my reads to end with.I've said this in my last two reviews so I might as well say it one last time. James Dashner is my hero! These books have been one of the most craziest, twisted and absolutely addicting books I've ever read and I can say this with a heavy heart... it will be tremendously missed.Congrats to James Dashner on such an epic series. You put your readers and your characters through absolute hell mister! But I've never had such a blast reading a series from beginning to end.Pure awesomesauce!
