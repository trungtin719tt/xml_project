I.Am.Speechless.This is easily one of the best series I have had the pleasure to read. I read all of the books back to back and let me tell you! Nothing ever prepared me for this epic adventure let alone the ending!I struggled to actually sit and write a review for the first two books, because I was so caught upon the adventure. I knew there was no way I could write a review until I read all three of the books. So instead of just reviewing The Iron Queen, this will be an Iron Fey review. Got it? Ok, off we go!The Iron Fey series is about a girl named Meghan Chase. When we first meet her he day of her 16th birthday, she is a normal, quiet, teenage girl struggling to fit in at school. However, when her brother is kidnapped by the fey, she travels to the Nevernever to rescue him alongside her best friend, Robbie Goodfell, who is the legendary Puck or Robin Goodfellow (unbeknownst to her until then). Along the way, she meets a Cait Sith named Grimilkin and the Winter Prince, Ash. She also finds out she is a half fey and her father is non other than Lord Oberon, King of the Summer Court. Along the journey, they discover a new breed of fey called Iron Fey. They are growing in number and threaten to destroy the Nevernever as they know it.However, she never planned on falling in love with Ash and he her. It is forbidden for summer and winter to fall in love. I loved watching Ash and Megan's love grow for each other in this series. It was beautiful. I did think that in the Iron daughter, Meghan got a bit obsessive, reminding me of Bella swan, but it can be over looked because this series is just that amazing.The character growth is brilliantly written. By the end of the series Meghan is no longer a shy girl; she is tough and knows what she wants. And even though Ash vows to protect her, he realizes that she has changed and become strong.The banter between Puck and Ash was classic. And I swear no one can insult and compliment someone in the same sentence the way Grimilkin did.The battle/fight scenes were epic! Very descriptive. I felt like I too was fighting besides Ash, Puck and Meghan.The best part of the series was the ending. The last book. Seriously. If you pick upThe Iron KingandThe Iron Daughterand are wondering what the hell I'm hyping this up for, READ THE LAST BOOK. It's one of the best books I have ever read. It was perfect. I think I cried for the entire ending. I felt the hope, desire, and love. I keep thinking there could have been another way Julie! But that is what I love about this series, it's realistic fiction. We don't always get what we want, no matter how hard we want it to be so. Living a fairy tale doesn't change that. And for that, I believe there was no other way to end this series with changing the book cannon.Hats off to you Julie Kagawa. That was truly remarkable.In the words of Meghan Chase,"It was...quite a ride. Wasn't it?"It sure was.I desperately look forward to The Iron Knight and any future works from Julie Kagawa's imagination.More reviews and more atCuddlebuggery Book Blog.
