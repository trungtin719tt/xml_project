Vimes is one of Pratchett's characters that has grown greatly over the course of the Discworld series. This book affirms Vimes' place as the traditional family man, a far cry from where Vimes was when the reader is first introduced to him inGuards! Guards!.The story itself highlights the growth of Anakh-Morpork as well as gives the reader valuable insight into the city's recurring, though not central, characters, such as Reg Shoe, Nobby, and Colon. Pratchett seems to really like Vimes, and in fact, Vimes seems to be the most human of all of Pratchett's creations. One wonders if Vimes is in some way Pratchett's own alter-ego. Along with Granny Weatherwax and Ridcully, Vimes represents in many way the old guard of the Disc.In this book, Vimes becomes use to his skin, to being called "his grace". He sees, perhaps, the need for such things as well as the use of politics. He doesn't want to go back to what he once was. Here, we see a Vimes at peace with himself, far more than he was inThe Fifth Elephant.Pratchett does not seem bored with his characters nor he is afraid to show the readers a pair of older lovers. Pratchett teaches us that we never stop learning or growing, not even as adults; nor can we fully disavow the past because the past helps us to grow.
