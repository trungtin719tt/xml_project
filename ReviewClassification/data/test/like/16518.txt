Don't pray over no body. I knew that I would figure it out. It was something I already knew. That's how you don't feel bad about wanting to know anyone. Don't expect anything. It doesn't get rid of the falling feeling when you think about them, though. Light in August is an ultimate societal kangaroo's pouch of claustrophobic guilt for me. Where does anyone belong?William Faulkner writes to me in my favorite way of being talked to in stories (anything). If I could have this in every book I read I would be so happy. It's like being a real person and you're trusted with something precious, like a soul or mortal heart. It is so simple, really, but I can't get it enough. The characters live in their world, they look at each other and I can hear what they think about each other and their lives. He says about her what she might say about him. He thinks he's lying and then you get an idea of what he thinks a lie really is. It's a brilliant way of doing it, really. What they are saying has vibrations and I'm not wearing any shoes and if they haven't swept the floor I can feel that too, if the author has told me so or not. I'm not told everything as the end all truth. This is this is that is this. Bless you, William Faulkner. I can't tell you how much this means to me. I don't have a lot of (useful) smarts but I have this. It's the constant of my life, my one true love and solace. I can read a book and see the ways it could go, threads to the past and hopes and all of that stuff. If I could write about this well I'd be one hell of a book reviewer. Characterization is the master(bater) of my heart. King and queen and off with my head.I was going to write something about unrequited love.Memory believes before knowing remembers.Joe Christmas is my character. My living and breathing person. My suffocated person that reflects from space time years away too late. There are some other great ones in Light in August but it is Joe Christmas that spurred my unrequited love (for a lack of a better word. You can call it Marsian love, or plutonic love, or like celebrating Christmas for something other than Christ). Will you think me too sick if I confess that I felt that bit of envy in my mouth (it tastes like your own mouth flavor but you aren't used to it for once) when I see someone aloof, mysteriously inside themselves even in the middle of the shit? It is sick because I'm no different. I want to be outside of me too damned bad, that's it. I know too damned well how Joe Christmas felt between the black and white people. Cold spot, hot spot. Hot and cold doesn't make warm. Somewhere else to be and he doesn't make a third triangle point, not ever. He was that to me. Everyone you can make out in the fuzzy color spectrum (are black and white even colors? They don't make warm) are written by a writer you can't read using your own what makes you you. I'll call mine my Mariel intutition for this review. (I shouldn't. It's paranoid as fuck.) Listen to their foot falls running from the jail that houses you. Look back at me! They don't. You don't know because the speed of sound travels slower than the speed of your people reading eyes. Keep watching their faces for that look you could have sworn you felt when you weren't looking. Don't open the letter from your hot and cold like menopausal lover because you might start to pray over your body too. The warmth is like the camp kids putting your hand in a bowl of warm water to make you pee. You could keep getting up in the middle of the night just in case. It is the worst when you expect to pee and it doesn't happen. I couldn't think of anything else. Better stay close just in case. Better stay close in case you could go on being the same and no one is going to pray for anyone else to be anything else. Better get it over with. I felt a little freaked out for talking to him in my head to please don't do that. I had no right.It was not the hard work which he hated, nor the punishment and injustice. He was used to that before he ever saw either of them. He expected no less, and so he was neither outraged nor surprised. It was the woman: that soft kindness which he believed himself doomed to be forever victim of and which he hated worse than he did the hard and ruthless justice of men. 'She is trying to make me cry,' he thought, lying cold and rigid in his bed, his hands beneath his head and the moonlight falling across his body, hearing the steady murmur of the man's voice as it mounted the stairway on its first heavenward stage; 'She was trying to make me cry. Then she thinks that would have had me.'Joe Christmas is going to haunt me. I always say that. What can I say? Somewhere between my left and right ear is enough company to keep me grounded. Who else? Who else!The minister Hightower in his walled in from the rest of the world house. The faces are never going to hint at passion again. His own big body is enough to weight him down in his chair by the wi(n)dow to mourn those he won't love. Byron Bunch the man who never told a lie because he didn't have the letter F to put in lie. Steal it! It's on discount over on Sesame Street. He won't. Hightower would move hell on earth to stop him. Can I confess thay Byron Bunch did not move me? The pregnant Lena in search of her if you could call him a husband (er) all the way from Alabama did not move me either. What was interesting about them was that they were monuments for other sounds to bounce off of. Why, you're right kind. I'm doing the right thing at my own expense. Really? And I never asked for nothing. He would ask in the doing. I wasn't moved because there was a little bit of I already knew that for me before they were done. I wouldn't want the right.I didn't think that the mistrust of their niggers or women was what was important. (It COULD be anything.) It was what they were willing to pray over. You know, what you would look at- first glance only- enough to call it yours. They allow Joe Christmas's desmise in their peace of mind for the thousand dollar reward. Next place. Easy peazy lemon squeazy. Hey, it's all the same. Look how far we have come, baby. It's interesting to me what is easy for someone else. Lena's slow reponse. I could time it in my mind from the corners of the mouth to the crease by the eye. It doesn't move much. It's all right! Sure, a baby. Yeah, that guy fucked me and I'm pregnant and look I knew it was going to work out. If Faulkner had a fault it was her profound sigh over Brown (the fucker). Don't know if I believe that. I think she was just waiting for her cue for the response again. Lena is Lena when she's in a place of her own (that she won't eat unless she is was a perfect touch too). The sigh is withheld, I think. Anyway, who am I to quibble? (I might take characters as too real...) I don't care so much about her state as a loose women in a world of men who will do for her if she looks like she might ask for them to do so. Those things don't have to be true. It's interesting that they took for granted that it was true. I kind of loved Faulkner for getting that right. People are fucking sexists and fucking racists and it doesn't have to be that way. The people in Jefferson took it all for granted. Joe took for granted what wouldn't happen in his limbo of that not really a color of black or white. He's no different and yet he haunted me because he was pining for something else. Hightower too, even if his was dead. Bunch's is a phantom like one of Lena's smiles. Call it my unrequited love. I want to see it the way through and not if I can already see its shadow there. I know I'm more like Joe because I didn't relate to Lena at all. I would never have trusted those people. It isn't a comfortable thing to realize and then the person you can relate to wouldn't trust you either.My unrequited love descriptor of all my time on this planet is Lucy in Peanuts sitting by Schroeder's piano bench. I would want a violinist. Put my ear to the wood and listen to its winds going in one ear and finding some place between the two. Linus's blanket is this. Faulkner's sentences hook me and its worm goes in one ear. My security is knowing this. I can read this. Don't pray over no body. If Joe Christmas was a killer? There was a Joe Christmas that wasn't. There could have been a Joe Christmas after that wasn't. Don't pray for something else. Don't kneel at the sacrificial altar for something else either. It's something I already knew. Something about not writing people off. Write them enough to live. I don't want to be Hightower and never again see on faces anything else but judgement. My unrequited love would be Charlie Brown's sad walk home between the black cabins and the safe white houses that really aren't so safe either. It's not finished. Will I have the right to want it? I'm no different so okay.When he went to bed that night his mind was made up to run away. He felt like an eagle: hard, sufficient, potent, remorseless, strong. But that passed, though he did not then know that, like the eagle, his own flesh was well as all space was still a cage.Faulkner is great. He has their cruelty and their bruises and their community of what people want. I don't know why I'm not giving this the full five stars, really, except that what I already knew like looking out of a window after the sound has already happened thing. It could just be one of those feelings I have that I can't explain very well. (That's also my unrequited love.) There is that thing where I wish I was invincible and no one would know what I was thinking either. You get where you're not sure if you're being laughed at or not to where knowing you're being laughed at is better. Damn you, Joe. Stop reminding me!The review that I was going to write that was rolling around in my mind yesterday was better than this, as always. Still, I hope this will mean something to someone, anyway. I don't see how it could but I hope it will.P.s. Sorry for the repost an hour or so later. Goodreads and Alice in her chair are fucking with me. I know it's a crime against goodreads. I hope you can forgive me.
