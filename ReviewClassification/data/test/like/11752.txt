This book is incredible. It is the TRUE story of a prison break from a penal colony in French Guiana which was later made into a movie with Steve McQueen--another of my favorites. If you liked Shawshank, you'll love Papillon.Henri Charrier, called Papillon for the butterfly tattoo on his chest, was convicted in Paris in 1931 for a murder he did not convict and was shipped off to French Guiana. It takes years and several failed attempts for Papillion to escape in this nail-biting story of amazing courage.The book has it all, sex (for a while Papillion has two Indian wives who are sisters), drugs and a little metaphorical rock and roll. I can't recommend it enough.Charriere wrote his autobiography in 1968, twenty years after he escaped.
