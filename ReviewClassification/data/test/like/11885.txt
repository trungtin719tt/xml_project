I originally read this book about 10 years ago, when the various pitfalls that ffrequently accompany YA didn't bother me as long as the story had something that could capture me - and this book, with it's absolute sanctuary of the Glass House, had exactly what I was looking for. I'm still very susceptible to a safe base/cosy home/preferably some sort of combo, but it was harder to overlook some issues this time. There's a touch of insta-love, the writing isn't what Rachel Caine is usually capable of, and - bad sin - a cliffhanger end. So it's fair to say that at least one of my stars is made purely of nostalgia.However, though I don't really enjoy Burger King any more, sometimes I just want to eat my daily calories in a single, glorious, greasy sitting. And this book is the enjoyable junk food of my bookshelf - though definitely less harmful. But it's fun, it's inoffensive, and it features a female protagonist who's actually strongly into science, school, and academics in general (even if it is initially handled in an omg-what-a-freak-I-am way).
