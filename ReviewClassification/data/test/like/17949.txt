As an example of smart &amp; savvy literature for smart &amp; savvy young adults 'Brainwalker' is one-of-a-kind, in a class by itself. Entertaining and phenomenally exciting in equal measure, it's an ambitious and adventurous work of fiction that manages to educate and inform in a non-didactic style that's super easy to absorb, even when the factual neuroscience is quite advanced. No-one can read this wonderful book and not come away feeling smarter and way more knowledgable about the both the human brain - and the human heart! 'Brainwalker never talks down to its reader and never ceases to demand anything but full engagement in a yarn that might once have been called 'incredible' - yet in light of recent scientific advances what Mundell &amp; Lacast have achieved can no longer be characterized as 'science fiction' but more accurately as speculative science 'fact'. It would come as no surprise to learn that movie studios were sniffing around this terrific book. After all, they wouldn't have to do a re-make, they can shoot 'Brainwalker' instead. A 'Fantastic Voyage' for the new millenium!
