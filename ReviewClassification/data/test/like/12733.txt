Sookie Stackhouse's life is as normal as a telepath can get. She has a vampire boyfriend, a house, a job, and friends. And then one day, the Merlotte's chef, Lafayette, turns up dead in Andy's car. Not to mention, she works for Eric on odd jobs, and he sends her to Dallas to do some investigating for the vampires.Once again, Sookie Stackhouse proves to be a (mostly) light-hearted, carefree paranormal series that is fun and fluffy and doesn't take itself too seriously. No, it isn't perfect. No, it probably doesn't have the most unique spin on vampires or shapeshifters, nor will it be a ground-breaking treatise on humanity or being alive or whatever. But the Sookie Stackhouse series never purports to be that, and that's just all right with me.The characters continue to be lively and fun. Sookie is a pretty good narrator. I like how she keeps upbeat and is able to investigate withOUT being rude (unlike Anita - though in this book she starts to analyze handshakes like Anita would and I broke into an Anita Blake cold sweat). It was a shame to see Lafayette dead (I don't remember him TOO much from the previous book, but he did seem fun), but other characters get time to shine, most notably Eric. Eric is most definitely being paved to be Sookie's newest romantic interest, and while I typically hate romantic triangles, I'm actually rather intrigued with this one. Up to this point, I've actually liked Bill, but in this book, Bill is beginning to be a little dry and dull and, most importantly, dominating. Not to mention, I'm really starting to get irritated at how each book Sookie and Bill break up only to get back together in a few pages.Other characters shine as well, such as Sam, Andy, Portia, and newbie (and new favorite), Luna.The mystery is pretty good; I like how there were two plotlines that were predominant in this book, Lafayette's murder and Eric's assignment for Sookie. It is neat to watch Sookie use her talents and skills to solve crimes and try to keep people alive.One problem I did kinda have is one I often do with urban fantasy/paranormal novels: the reliance on rape/sexual assault for drama. In this book, bad guy Gabe tries to rape Sookie. Then Sookie goes to an orgy where she is felt up. This is not the first time Sookie has had to endure sexual assault or near rape in this series. Not to mention, it's odd how very little these events seem to affect Sookie long-term. I know "Rule of Funny" or "It's a fun paranormal book, not a serious lit book!", but none-the-less, Sookie has had to endure quite the trauma in just two books. It's weird that she hasn't shown any sign of this trauma other than bruises that quickly heal.Even with the road bumps, I still found this fun, I dare say, more fun than book 1. The characters are interesting, Harris is setting up a neat little world, and I can't wait to learn more (as long as Harris drops the idea of an executioner in this world - I do not want to see grumpy, sexist Anita Blake in this upbeat world!). I'll definitely be loading up book 3 in my iPod tonight!
