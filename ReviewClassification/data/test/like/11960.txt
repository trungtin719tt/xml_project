Funny. Light. Completely brainless. Perfect beach book. The main character is a completely out of control shopaholic, and will go to any lengths to conceal her addiction while still feeding it on the sly. It's a thoroughly enjoyable book, but it has a fatal flaw, the flaw that made me give it a "liked it" rating instead of a "really liked it" rating. This chick drives me NUTS! It is almost physically painful to see her destroying her life for a new scarf or perfect shoes. Priorities, woman! Pay your rent, stop buying couture, and get a real life!There are several more books in the series, most of which I've read. I guess I'm a glutton for punishment when it's funny and entertaining punishment.
