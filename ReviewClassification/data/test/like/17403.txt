Hey, is it just me, or is "American Horror Story Roanoke" episodes 1-5 a mega rip off of this? Only those that have read House of Leaves can possibly know...As avant garde as any novel's got the right to be! It is all about condensing and expanding the parameters of the novel, heck, of the tangible object. It makes a case of molding the form like clay-doh; a book is stationary no more... (!!!)You open the book and a dissection, an exploration is made. You are the surgeon &amp; all this takes is your time, your attention, your very personhood! Can you imagine what Borges would have made of this?"House of Leaves": A damn necessary read. This will change your life in a compelling, unexpected way. Trust.
