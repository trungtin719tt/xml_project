A light-hearted children's fantasy book. There are mice, rats, badgers, sparrows, ferrets, otters, moles, a big bad snake and more.A fortress called Redwall in the middle of the Mossflower wood is attacked by Cluny the Scourge, an evil villain who is hell bent upon invading the Redwall and ruling over the folk of this small castle. The inhabitants are all kindly, non-warrior folk. But when the scum Cluny brings the battle to their doorstep, they rise to the occasion with wit and will and try to defend Redwall. Matthias, a brave mouse, goes on quest to find the sword of Martin The Warrior, who is the symbol that Redwall look up to while facing Cluny. Matthias braves many dangers and meets quite a few interesting characters along the way.I enjoyed every bit of this tale, though I have to admit, I needed time to wrap my head around the fact that most of this story is happening on a small scale of things, you know, what with mice and rats and all being the mail characters.
