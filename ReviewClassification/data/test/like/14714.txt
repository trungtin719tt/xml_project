Awwwwww...it'sover. *sniff* *sigh*I'm just blown away by JR Ward's writing. There hasn't been a real 'miss' for me in this series yet, but I was a little concerned about this one. Could JR Ward make me fall in love with JM's and (especially) the rather cold, butch Xhex's story? Not to worry, she accomplished that...in spades. Now my mind is trying to sort out all the reasons why I enjoyed this one so much. Once again, JR Ward packs her stories with so much info, so much description, so much plot, so much adventure, so muchgood stuffthat it took me twice as long to read it as I thought it would. But that is in part because I wanted to savor it slowly, and I wanted to make sure that I didn't miss a thing! This is an awesome tale of two survivors who overcome all sorts of odds to find happiness. So on with the review...As we leftLover AvengedXhex, John Matthew, Rehv and the Brothers were battling the sympaths and Lash up north in the sympath colony. Xhex disappeared, and it looked like she may have been abducted by Lash. WhenLover Mineopens, almost 4 weeks have passed, JM and the Brothers are searching for Xhex, and we find out that she is indeed being imprisoned and abused by the increasingly evil Lash. But Xhex is determined to find a way out from her imprisonment, and hasn't given up. She's fights Lash with all that she has, which of course makes Lash want her more. He's clearly obsessed with her, and he has big plans...Meanwhile, JM and the Brothers figure that Lash either has Xhex or killed her, they just need to figure out where he's stashed her. JM, in his despair, decides to tattoo his feelings for Xhex on his back. He may never see her again, but he will carry her with him through eternity...Xhex eventually escapes (after a heartbreaking scene where JM mourns at an invisible Xhex's bedside) and is reunited with JM. Now they must finally face the feelings that they have for each other, while planning the destruction of Lash. Will Xhex allow herself to feel something for JM? Or will she continue to break his heart?Wow, what can I say about JM and Xhex? I've always liked JM, loved reading about him in all the books, although I couldn't understand his attraction to Xhex. And when she treated him badly in "Lover Avenged", I was a little angry with her. But I knew JRW would have some explanation for her actions, and would most likely make her more likable. And she did, without taking away any of Xhex's kick-ass personality. She gave her a backstory that satisfied my questions about her, made me sympathize with her, and showed in "Lover Mine" that her character was able to grow and change and that she was worthy of JM's devotion. She may not be my favorite female in the series, but I certainly came to respect and admire her, and thought she was perfect for John Matthew. And it looks like there's a lot of story left for this couple, and I can't wait to see where it takes us.Besides the main storyline of JM and Xhex and their plan to destroy Lash and their growing feelings for one another,Lover Minecontains some tasty side plots. They are...*Blay and QhuinnBlay is tired of waiting for the promiscuous Qhuinn to realize his feelings for him, and with a broken heart, moves on with Qhuinn's cousin Saxton. Is it too late for Blay/Qhuinn?This plot just about broke my heart. Blay's longing for Qhuinn, Qhuinn's refusal to follow what was in his heart and instead follow a path that he thought was 'normal' and would be approved by the glymera, and then Blay's decision to move on...even though he deserved it, my heart broke with Qhuinn's when he realized that he lost Blay. When Blay opened that door to Saxton's room, I kept thinking "NO, don't go in there!"*PayneWrath continues sparring with Payne on the Far Side. Payne wants to leave what she sees as her prison for life on the other side, but the Scribe Virgin says no...until a sparring match with Wrath turns deadly. Will Payne finally get to meet the Brother who she thought was dead?Payne is an interesting character. Ward sort of left us in the lurch about what's going to happen to her. Will her injury be reversible? Will Dr. Manny be her HEA? How will she get along with the brother who she thought was dead? I can't wait to read her story.*Tohrment and DariusWard takes the reader on a journey that shows how Darius and Tohr's friendship began hundreds of years ago, while simultaneously revealing the sad circumstances of Xhex's birth and the family that did not want her. Some good stuff here. We learn a lot about Darius's past, the kind of man he was, and how he was a mentor to Tohr. I loved the whole connection between Darius, Tohr, JM, and Xhex. By the end of this book it looked like Tohr was finally getting himself together. I don't know if there can ever be anyone for him besides Wellsie, but I'd like to hope so. I want to see him happy again.*MurhderWe finally learn some of the details of what became of Xhex's first love, Murhder, and what he's doing now. It took quite a while for this side plot to unfold, and at first I had no clue how this storyline connected to the rest of the book and it took me a while to connect all the dots. But finally I had my "A-ha" moment, but by then that was the end of Murhder... for now.I don't know Ward's plans, but surely Murhder (who was a Brother before he went mad and disappeared) will surely come knocking on Xhex's door again, right?Some of my favorite scenes/quotes in LM:*JM leaving with Xhex's pillow after he broke down at her bedside*JM washing Xhex in the shower after her surgery, taking gentle care of her...Xhex cupping his face, saying he's a 'male of worth', kissing him...*Xhex telling JM he has beautiful table manners, and JM blushing*JM and Xhex's 'first time' in the stretching facility...HOT*JM taking Xhex with him on a journey down memory lane as he reveals his past to her*Xhex telling JM:"You're not half the male you could be because of what was done to you. You're twice what anyone else is because you survived."*Xhex, refusing to get all girly over JM:"I'll have you know that I'm not the kind of female who goes all dizzy, popping a stiletto off the floor just because some guy kisses her deep. You're not turning me into one of those females who goes gaga over her lover. Not happening. I'm not hardwired for that."*When Xhexfinallygets a look at the tattoo on JM's back*Xhex wanting to kill Lash not for herself, but for John:"You don't f*** with what's mine."*JM putting Xhex's needs before his own when it came down to destroying Lash*JM's long conversation with Tohr where he finally understands everything and says"Come with me. Do this with me."*Qhuinn realizing that he lost Blay and what that means to him...Life goes on...long after the thrill of living is gone...And a few that made me chuckle...*Qhuinn, telling Blay about Saxton:"He's a slut, a very classy, very elegant slut."*About Qhuinn's promiscuity:...he was Wilt Chamberlain with fangs.*Lassiter getting upset with what he's missing on TV because Tohr is hogging the remote:"Come on I'm missingMaury. Paternity tests, Tohr. You're button-blocking paternity tests. This sucks."*Z walking away (after a conversation with JM) with a pink baby bib stuffed in his back pocketAnd of course, the ones that had me tearing up...*Tohr's gift to Xhex*JM's mating gift to Xhex*JM to Xhex:"I would hold you up. I will ever hold you up and hold you dear, lover mine."Fans of this series will be happy to know that almost everyone (with the exception of Cormia and Marissa) is either mentioned, has an appearance, a small speaking role, or a larger role (Doc Jane certainly had her work cut out for her in this one). Wrath, Tohr, Doc Jane, and Rehv all had ample face time, and V, Z, Rhage, Butch, Ehlena, Trez, iAm, and Lassiter all were heard from. We also find out the identity of the mysterious No'One (surprising), and get some set ups for some possible follow up books. Clearly Ward is not finished with Blay/Qhuinn, Qhuinn/Layla, Payne,orTohr.One more thing that I must mention, and that is the gore in this book. Ugh! If it wasn't the oily mess that the dead Lessers leave behind that grossed me out, or the 'inductions' into the Lessening Society, it was the shocking physical transformation of Lash that was right out of a horror movie! Oh my. If you don't mind a little blood and guts, violence, and horror (oh jeez, the Omega...) in your books, then you'll love all the nastinest that JRW serves up. Lash's transformation was disturbing, gruesome...yet I couldn't look away! Truly horrific.So fans of the BDB, this is a good one. If you didn't care for Xhex before give her a chance. You might have to wait until around page 300 to see it, but she and John Matthew are hot together. True, she's different than all the other shellans, she's a tough customer with lots of rough edges, but I think you'll grow to love her, as I did.Verily, I would not steer you wrong on this. "Lover Mine" is not to be missed! 5 starsMy John Matthew...
