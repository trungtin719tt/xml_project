I read Zorba the Greek, originally titled Alexis Zorba, by Nikos Kazantzakis as part of my 2017 classic bingo challenge. Considered the 20th century Greek novel most known to American audiences, Zorba chronicles the lives of two unlikely friends as they attempt to build a mining empire in Crete. Later a movie starring Anthony Quinn, Zorba is an impassioned novel detailing Greek culture while also going in depth into the souls of two complex men.Our narrator first meets Zorba at a tavern in Piraeus. Although he has traveled all over Europe and is about to embark for Crete to begin a mining expedition there, he is known by sailors as a book worm. While his miners toil, the narrator is content pouring over a manuscript or reading the teachings of the Buddha. At first glance it is apparent that he is not well versed in the ways of the world, and, amidst the teasing of his companions, Zorba appears and insists on leading the team of miners. The two set sail for Crete, and both an adventure and deep friendship commence.While copper mining is the premise for this Greek classic, the novel centers on the title character Zorba as he pours out his soul to the narrator. The two share a meager hut by the beach, and nightly Zorba cooks simple yet hearty meals of fish stew, meat chops, bread, and wine. Over food, dance, music, and a Greek guitar called the santuri, Zorba regales his friend in the ways of the world. He spins captivating yarns about his travels throughout Eurasia and attempts to bring his friend away from books and into the world.In addition to Zorba's pearls of wisdom, we meet the characters in this remote Cretan village and learn of their way of life. National pride runs high at a time when Crete was a separate nation from Greece, and each country in Macedonia held distrust of her neighbor. Even though Zorba's presence fills a room, villagers are skeptical of him at first because he is Greek, not Cretan. Thus, the miners live away from the village, slowly building rapport with the town elders, all the while regaling each other with the stories of their travels.Although slow moving at times, I enjoyed learning about early 20th century Greek culture and customs. Centered around a Greek Orthodox calendar, the monastery and church as well as the protagonists' beliefs play a large role in the novel. We are regaled with traditional food, dances, and festivals that may not be well known outside of the Mediterranean. Zorba, even though he is worldly, still appears to be a religious person, and dreams of opening his own monastery together with the narrator. Although he attempts to conquer every woman he encounters including the town siren Dame Hortense, with whom he shares a special relationship, Zorba does not miss church on important festivals, making his a life of contradictions. Despite his and others' treatment of women, I viewed this as normal of the time and place and allowed myself to be swept up in Zorba's tales.Zorba the Greek merited inclusion on the Boklubben of Norway one hundred classic book list. Sad and wistful at times, it is a beautiful story of a man who is larger than life and an era gone by. The narrator, who appears to be a fictional character based on Kazantzakis' own life, weaves a poignant tale of his and Zorba's lives together as they attempt to conquer Crete. Alexis Zorba appeared as a man larger than life and transported me to another era where time slows down, and people slowly pass time by strumming the santuri while sipping wine and eating halvah. I thoroughly enjoyed reading this Greek classic, and rate it a full, bright 5 stars.
