This is the quintessential YA summer read. If all female YA characters were written to be like these girls, YA would be a much better genre.Four best friends will be spending the summer apart for the first time since birth. Carmen is going to visit her dad (and - unbeknownst to her - his new family); Lena (along with her sister Effie) are meeting their grandparents for the first time in Greece; Bridget is flying to Los Angeles for soccer camp (and a lesson in love); and Tibby is staying behind to work at a department store where she makes a new friend that will change her life.I love the way everything is handled in this book. The girls each have unique and complex personalities. They all discover that they are flawed and they all work to understand why they behave the way they do. They support each other, they love each other, but they also confront each other (in the most beautiful, patient, loving manner).The romance that occurs is much less about the guys, and much more about Bridget and Lena learning something about themselves. It's freaking brilliant and such a healthy way of depicting first love to teenagers. Also the male characters are lovely!! But also not the be-all, end-all or centre of the girls' worlds!What I especially liked was the portrayal of Bailey's leukemia. Most books likeThe Fault in Our StarsorMy Sister's Keepermake cancer out to be horribly grotesque and macabre, leaving you with a terribly bleak feeling in the pit of your stomach. I have long since wished the media would paint cancer in a different light, such as this book does. It's a part of life and it's something that has to be dealt with! The light-hearted, candid way that Bailey and Tibby address Bailey's illness and mortality issorefreshing.Ultimately I think this is a must-read for any young teen that has started consuming YA novels. Nearly 20 years later andThe Sisterhood of the Traveling Pantsstill holds its own.
