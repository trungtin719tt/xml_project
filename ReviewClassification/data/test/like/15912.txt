This book fascinated me when I was learning to read. I would read and reread it. I had a deep empathy for the bull, who found himself captive and with life in danger because of mistaken identification.The story and pictures were interesting and left questions open to my young mind that caused me to gaze in with my eyes and imagination to try to see what was beyond the pages of the story and beyond what was shown in the illustrations.I was raised in Bartlesville, Oklahoma. It was a nice mid-western town of approximately 32,000 residents. To me, Spain was a magical realm and the images of Robert Lawson provided sensory information of that place for my mind. I was so sheltered that I did not know crime existed in our town until I was well into high school. There were a lot of things about the real world around me that I was oblivious to.The idea of the bull fight as something people actually did teased my mind. I understood the concept, but thought it was something that happened so long ago that it was a part of history. I did not believe the people I knew would kill an animal for sport in that way (I believed hunting was different, because the hunter makes the death quick, and he is justified to hunt because he eats the animal). I also could not believe the people in my town would watch such a spectacle. I remember extrapolating that the people of Bartlesville were no different from the people any place else. Yet,therewas a story describing the bull fight as though everyone thought it was good fun. Andtherewere the illustrations showing the people and culture as though they were real.I didn't know what to think...And, poor Ferdinand. I was horrified.I remember looking at the faces and hats of the five men, in the illustration, who searched for a bull for the arena. I imaged what they were like and what their conversation was upon seeing Ferdinand during his rampage. I followed them home in my mind to see what the houses would look like for men who were dressed like they were.The corks hanging from the cork trees like fruit were a detail that really amused me. I discussed them with my mother.I have since read that "The Story of Ferdinand" was a cast off Munro Leaf wrote in half an hour to give his friend Lawson a story to illustrate. Regardless of how much or how little thought Munro Leaf put into the story it is true that children like myself have enjoyed the story and empathized with the Bull Ferdinand for decades.Throughout my life, every time I see a copy my heart leaps a little and I always want to open it to go into that world and see my old friend again. I love this book so much that I gave a copy to a colleague at her baby shower. It was an opportunity to share. I wish the enjoyment that I have gotten from that book upon every child.
