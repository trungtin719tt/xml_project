*** 3.75. ***A buddy read with the MacHalo Freaks!A very pleasant read in the world of Mercy Thompson. While I was reading this book it actually reminded me of the native American storytelling meets around the fire I used to go to with friends in the Summers... It had the feel and even the melody of those stories, which was exactly what the author meant to express, I am guessing...It starts with Anna from the horrible Chicago pack moving to the mountains of Montana to live with her potential mate, the very alpha male Charles. There are adjustments to be made, a new pack to get acclimated to, and to learn about each other most of all.A rogue Wolf is hurting falks in the mountains and the pack's alpha, Charles dad, sends him and Anna to deal with it. While looking for the elusive lone wolf they stumble upon something malevolent and cunning which poses a serious threat to all wolfs in the aeria and possibly in North America.Bad guys do some damage, good guys survive, mostly... It is an example of an earlier style of writing an UF novel, which is more linear and compact than the more aggressive style the genre has gone towards in the last 5 years, but it is a good read.I recommend it to all UF fans and especially those who can do with less violence and slower character development. Have fun reading:-)!!!
