I'm continually impressed with Brandon Sanderson, and I appreciate the subtle (at least to me) morality in his books. As most people who read his books will know, Sanderson comes from a Mormon background, and I think this only enhances his ability and perspective as a writer.I read his first widely published novel Elantris a few years back. The pace, magic, character development, etc., was all good, esp. for a first novel. I eventually picked up Mistborn a few months after its release and this time I was simply blown away - it is a great beginning to a trilogy. It isn't perfect, but it is truly great. I've just finished the second book in the trilogy, The Well of Ascension, and - again - I'm astounded with his work. His characters are believable, the magic system continues to be impressive, and it is paced well.Regardless of the arguments - Brandon Sanderson is a very good writer. His magic system is original and very, very well thought-out. I recommend the first two books of the Mistborn trilogy to anyone - whether or not you're a fantasy genre fan. Not only are his books fast and fun reading, but they are thought provoking and deep. Just like other landmark series in the sci-fi and fantasy genres, I believe this trilogy will be enjoyed for generations to come.
