Audiobook nirvana!I loved listening to "Will Grayson, Will Grayson". The narrators were perfection, managing to sound kind of age appropriate and also doing the inflections, the feels, to a "T". A fabulous listen, audio lovers. A must buy.In terms of the story, I started off liking John Green's Will Grayson more. I haven't read any John Green before, so I found his MC to be really enjoyable. You know, the kind of nerdy, quiet, emo guy that I have a huge soft spot for. But I loved how John Green wrote Tiny Cooper most of all. Some of the lines that John Green came up with... just amazingly quotable, witty, hilariousness.I actually began the book kind of hating Levithan's Will Grayson. I found him to be contemptuous, and I took a bit of personal offense at how much of a dick he was towards his mom. I struggled to like him at all for the first 25% or so. However, as the book progressed, I found that Levithan's character just completely sucker-punched me with PAIN and emotion. Wow, he just nailed it, honestly. Levithan's Will Grayson ended up being much more memorable for me. Excellently done.I liked how the two Will Grayson's ended up meeting and how the two stories twisted together. I wasn't crazy about the ending, but the book overall was really charming. I'll be reading more from these authors in the future.
