Really neat story. It was a fun view into life about a century ago.My only nit with it was with the particular audio book I heard: an annoying afterward that publisher felt he had to append. In it, he explained to us how Mr. Verne's views of other cultures are simply not acceptable to modern people such as ourselves, and although he has transgressed and used stereotypes of different cultures the book still has some value.I found it unfair and unnecessary. Verne's depiction of different cultures includes stereotypes, of course, but he goes out of his way to present a variety of individuals in each culture. Some are good, some are bad. Some fit the stereotypes, and some don't. In other words, he describes the world as he saw it. I don't need someone to explain to me that the book still has some value.
