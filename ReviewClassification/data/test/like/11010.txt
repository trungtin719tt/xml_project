I was assigned this many years ago in high school &amp; still have my 1975 paperback edition, so I was surprised byJeff Shaara's introduction talking about how unknown this book was, especially when it won a Pulitzer Prize. I would guess he knows what he's talking about, but I've known many people to read it over the years. Of course, I lived only a couple of hours from Gettysburg which languished for years. Only recently has a real concerted effort been made to upgrade the facilities there led in a large part by Bob Kinsley.I certainly don't believe Jeff's claim that his father was the first author to publish historical fiction of this sort. Way before this book, I was readingHarold Lamb's books, Scott's "Grandfather's Tales" &amp; others like it. Michael, in his foreword, even talks about the similarity of his story toStephen Crane'sThe Red Badge of Courage. I hate it when people make claims like this. OK, you're proud of your father &amp; his work wasn't as well recognized as it deserved during his life, but don't distort the facts too much Jeff. It doesn't do the book any favors.Shaara's descriptions are great &amp; he really gets inside the heads of the people, sometimes too much. My biggest disappointment &amp; the reason this isn't getting 5 stars is that Shaara crossed the line too often into fantasy. He went on &amp; on about feelings that may have been real, but were certainly over done - just too much for a decent history. The book could have been shortened quite a bit &amp; still retained the same power &amp; flavor. I had to take a break in the middle because it got to me. I'm glad I continued, though.The main themes of the battle are personalized.- The leaders of the armies knew each other well enough to not only like &amp; respect their opponents, but out guess each other &amp; mourn their deaths &amp; defeats even while striving to bring them about.- Communications SUCKED &amp; this caused the South's greatest strength, their independence, morale, &amp; go-for-broke attitude, to bite them in the ass. Jeb Stuart was completely out of position blinding Lee &amp; Hill drawing them into the battle against orders being the two most obvious examples at the start of the fight.- The weariness of all concerned at this critical juncture 2 years into the war. Knowing the war dragged on for almost 2 more years afterward makes this even worse, especially given how the battle ended &amp; the casualties they took.- The heat was awful. I'm listening to this in July, the same month as the battle was fought, sweating my butt off doing light chores. It's hard to imagine men fighting in this weather amidst thick smoke, dust, dirt, &amp; disease.The reading is great &amp; makes the story really come alive. The only problem was that I didn't have a very good map of the area in my head, so I went looking for one. This map &amp; explanation of day 1 &amp; 2 is pretty good, but it requires you to sign up to go beyond that. I didn't.http://education-portal.com/academy/l...I looked a bit further &amp; found this wonderful overview of the entire battle.http://www.civilwar.org/battlefields/...They call it an animated map, but it has film clips &amp; period pictures as well. The map part is perhaps the best for figuring out where the main players were &amp; how the battle developed. After referring to it once, I didn't need to again. If you get a few of the main places in your head, the story is easy enough to follow.The Wikipedia entry is very good for an overview, too.http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_o...The afterword sketches out what happened to the main players that survived the battle. Many of their endings were tragic, but there were a few happy ones. All in all, excellent &amp; it's a book I highly recommend.
