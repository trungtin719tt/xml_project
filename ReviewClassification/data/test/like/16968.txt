I read this before the move was made. This the perfect example of how very much American laws &amp; justices system is so different from British law special with children.This an excellent crime court room drama that only Grisham could write as he was trained court lawyer which is needed to get the facts dead right. After all you need how to crack eggs to make an omelette you would not expect a bricklayer to try to make a swimming pool on upstairs flat.This like all his books twists &amp; turns like top in hands of a master spinner.
