I have a flippant love-hate aboutSand and Fog. I've redone this review in its entirety FOUR TIMES now. I hate the ending and last few chapters with a certain hellfire, but the rest of it is so beautiful - written is such intricate, sensitive detail that you can't possibly dislike it, even when the characters derail into illogical extremes. The last chapters, though... they'll kick your soul in the face. The ending is understandable, but why did it have to end like that?The moral of this story - miscommunication kills. Pride goeth before the fall.You have these three characters who are broken by their circumstances - Colonel Behrani's fall from a life of grace and luxury, Kathy's loss of her father's house due to a tax error, and Lester's collapsing relationship with his wife and kids. Their argument over this modest house near the beach, starts as somewhat of an annoyance and escalates into a complete volatile breakdown, all because of their pride, and inability to admit when they may have been wrong, or mistaken.The writing style is like poetry, it might as well be poetry for how beautiful it is. Just don't go into it expecting a lighthearted read.House of Sand and Fogis at heart, about very realistic, very human despair and unhappiness that can happen because of a few simple mistakes.
