I am still one of those people that enjoys Nicholas Sparks books and movies. I really prefer to read the book before I watch the movie, so I've owned the movie since it came out but never watched it. This was the first TBR takedown book and I am happy to say this seems to be working well, and now I don't have to unhaul this book.I really enjoyed the story and the characters. The story is a typical story for him to write but I still liked it nonetheless, and particularly the letter at the end.Not going to lie I am just excited that I can watch this movie tonight!
