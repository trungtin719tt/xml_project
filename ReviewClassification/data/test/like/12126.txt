I remember reading this book in one sitting in the nineties, and what a sitting it was! My husband had business meetings in Basingstoke and I had joined him. It was May, nice weather, so I chose a bench in the park and started reading. Of course I walked around the centre and had lunch but for the rest of the time I just sat on that bench reading and had finished the book by the end of that day. I have read other books by her, but I've never enjoyed them as much. Now Ms. Pilcher has died on the 6th of February and I have the feeling that I should read The shell seekers again as a tribute and to see if I'm still as carried away by it as I was then.
