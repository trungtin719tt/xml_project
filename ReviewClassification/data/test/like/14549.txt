Darren Aronofsky, who directed the film adaptation of Requiem for a dream wrote 'I needed to make a film from this novel because the words burn off the page. Like a hangman's noose, the words scorch your neck with rope burn and drag you into the sub-sub-basement we humans build beneath hell'. I concur. And there is not a great deal i can add to that apart from a few personal musings.It took me quite a long time to read this book, as being an addict and alcoholic myself i found the experience suprisingly overwhelming and emotionally painful. Then at the end of the book, there is a short biography about the genius author which highlights a few things which make it more understandable why this didn't just feel like a book to me, but something a bit more, like a connection was made with the author. Selby Jr was a member of Alcoholics Anonymous, like myself and also struggled with addiction problems all his life. I hear real life stories similar to this day in day out, week in week out from people recovering or attempting to recover from what is an illness that only those people with the illness can understand. So the authors genius really lies in his ability to put this across to a mass audience.If you look on the web, unsuprisingly this book appears on numerous 'Top ten most disturbing novels' lists. I read a lot of the reviews for this book associated with the these lists and was suprised by a number of reviews which were adamant that Selby Jrs portrayal of the escalation of drug use was inaccurate, overblown and unrealistic scare mongering. I used to think like that, for example when i read 'Last Exit to Brooklyn' many, many years ago and hadn't yet been stung. I honestly hope people who have such delusional thoughts don't pay with their lives one day.I needed to read this book. Having become slightly disillusioned and bored with sobriety recently and tormented with emotional pain that i thought i had got rid of for good, thoughts had been creeping into my mind of going back out there and having another go at the merry dance. Having just finished the last page and taken a momentary glance at my seven year old daughter who is sprawled all over me on the sofa, innocently watching kids tv and kicking me in the ribs, i've decided i'll take emotional pain any minute of the day thank you very much. Its a gift compared to the alternative.
