This book was... WOW. This book is one of the best books I have ever read on the subject of drug addiction. This book beautifully describes, in a verse form, how drugs completely and horribly destroyed a girls life. This book weaves together a tale of the dangers of drugs.The main character was very relatable, though I have never done drugs, one finds themselves sympathizing with her and her struggles. Even hating one of the characters so much for hurting the main character. The main character is were the book finds its strength and its beauty.I recommend this book to anyone who wants a very emotional read, and relatable characters.I honestly can't wait to read more of Ellen Hopkins' books.
