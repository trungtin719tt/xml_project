The Namesake by Jhumpa Lahiri vividly describes the lives and the plight of the immigrant families, with a focus on Indians settled in America.The book revolves around the common themes that this subject entails, mainly the immigrant experience as a whole, which includes the multi-cultured lives the families (especially the kids) lead, which then leads to being the basis of a queer relationship among the generations - the so called 'generation gap' which in this case is majorly affected by the culture clash.The story is emotional, and is sure to raise the hysteria in you. The bittersweet tale is sure to teach you a life lesson or two.This is my first read from Jhumpa, and I will be picking up more of her books in the future.Verdict: Recommended.
