I kindly received a copy from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.The main character of this book is the young Bernard. I loved this boy a lot. He loves science, thinks out of the box, challenges everything and is not scared to ask questions. But after his mother died in an experiment gone wrong, no one appreciates his crazy ideas and curious mind, least of all his dad. When Bernard follows his wandering mind in the 'Atom Smasher' at his father's work, he ends up going through a wormhole that brings him inside his father's brain.This is a very unique and wonderful setting. The authors managed to make an easy to understand and fairly magical portrayal of the brain, while also being mostly accurate. It shows off the difference between the left and the right side of the brain in a fun and beautiful way.The first third was a bit flat for me. Things went too easy, the conversations were a bit off... but the story really picks up after that. A few nice characters are introduced and the stakes rise. It turns in a fun, fast-paced and action-packed story I ended up reading in a single sitting.Something that really adds to the story is the amazing artwork throughout the book.Overall I found this a great book for young readers who like their science, or to waken up an interest in those who do not (yet). This wonderful story of an amazing boy in an unique world has something for everyone.
