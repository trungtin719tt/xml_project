Maybe it was because I had low expectations, or because I don't read this genre very often, or maybe I just like angel books, but I kind of loved this?? It stumbles a few times (love interest perpetuates the idea that "if a boy is mean to you that means he actually likes you!" and there's some slut shaming) but I want to continue the series.Things that may sway whether you would like this or not:-Love triangle.-Lots of Twilight vibes. No watching people sleep, but it's a new kid in school is a paranormal being mysteriously drawn to a human kind of story - but we're following the paranormal character in this case.Potential triggers:Very brief, non-detailed mention of rape. Slur toward Romani people. Forest fire.
