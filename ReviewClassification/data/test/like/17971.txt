Rules of Attraction was a good story that I enjoyed reading but I didn't think Carlos and Kiara had the crazy chemistry that Alex and Brittany did. So the romance wasn't as satisfying and electric. Carlos was also not as sympathetic a character as Alex because I felt like Alex only did bad things because he had no other choice while Carlos acted like a punk just because he wanted to. But overall the story was a good read that I enjoyed a lot.We got to see more of Alex and Brittany as they are both in college. They hit a rough patch in their relationship when Alex doesn't want to meet with her parents because he is afraid she will realize she can do better than him but they work things out when she convinces Alex that she wants to be with him no matter when anyone thinks and she refuses to hide their relationship at all. So by the end they are fine :) They just have such great chemistry as a couple, it was great seeing more of them.
