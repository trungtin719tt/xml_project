I am conflicted. Having just finished this book, I find my thoughts engaged in a heated debate. How I can capture my response to this book? Why did I score it a four instead of a five like all of my close friends and associates? Was the writing not brilliant in parts? Indeed. Were the characterizations not complex and layered? Most assuredly. What is at the root of my angst?The book was painful. Several times I nearly quit reading. I didn't really care for most of the people. I didn't want to keep them in my life and share with them their anguish and unrequited dreams. I was angry with Wallace Stegner. Why do you have to write so well that the wounds these characters inflicted are real and festering and gangrous?This novel has been on my "to read" shelf for nearly half of a century. Wallace Stegner is a legend where I live. Seminars and symposiums are held in his honor and memory. He lived beneath the mountains that I call home.However, I wasn't caught up in the story for quite some time. In fact, were it not for the commitment I have to lead the discussion in an upcoming book group, I may have totally abandoned this novel.The style took me some getting used to - the bantering and commentary amidst supposed primary documents in letter format. Finally after about seventy pages, I simply admitted to myself that there were bound to be ups and downs in this book. There were going to be times I was engaged and times I was not.Perhaps the novel is "too real". Perhaps there are more marriages like this than I would like to admit. Perhaps there are parts of each character in all of us - parts we don't want to own and aren't proud to recognize.I mourn for the losses in the novel while I admire the fortitude and the tenacity of the characters. I reverence the building of the West and the solid stock of pioneers that forged into the unknown. I honor my ancestors. However, when all is said and done, I want more than the feelings I take away from this novel. I want more than just an angle of repose at the end of my life.Scholar and friends mark this Pultizer Prize book as Stegner's best.Crossing to Safetyremains my favorite. Ironically, I have just finished two other books written by students ofWallace Stegner.Wendell BerryandLarry McMurtryalso wrote about the West but instead of mining as a fulcrum, it was cattle drives or farming. I am ready to move on now to something different. How fortunate that choices are so abundant and that I have so many good recommendations from friends on Goodreads.Returning to my earlier "review" I have finally come to terms with my selfish response. Simply because I wasn't settled with the way the relationships in the book resolved does not mean I can not give credit to the author for a masterpiece. This book still slips into my thoughts and in all honesty the reviews and responses from other Goodread friends have influenced me. I will rank it the five stars it deserves. Now I hope for awhile at least I can put it to rest.
