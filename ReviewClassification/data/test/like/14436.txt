Goethe's breakthrough hit haunted him all his life. Poor guy: it'sembarrassing.It's about a young guy around Goethe's age (24), whose name more or less rhymes with Goethe, who falls hopelessly in love with a married woman, like Goethe did, and then mopes about quoting poetry like this:It is night;I am alone,forlorn on the hill of storms.Goethe is inventing emo here, and let he who has not written shitty poetry in his or her youth cast the first stone. (Here he's quoting an imaginary author named Ossian, so this is Goethe's poetry but not Werther's.) I can't even begin to tell you how lucky we all are that you've never heard some of the stuff I came up with back in the day.Charlotte Buff, Goethe's own LotteThe thing about Werther is that this book could have been written yesterday. Goethe does a bang-up job of describing the hopeless angst of young love, and the embarrassing excesses that go along with it. Angst is timeless.Alas, this void! This dreadful void that I feel in my breast! - I often think: If you could press her to your heart just once, just once, the entire void would be filled.Right? This is some Romeo &amp; Juliet shit here, and I kinda love it. Bummer for Goethe that he wrote the epicFaustbut all his life people were like "Lol, that's that emo guy who got dumped." But it's kindof a great book.Okay fine, you know what, here's the first song I ever wrote. I was 13.All aloneAfter eightWhat to do?Masturbate!And then I just yelled "Whackin' off!" a bunch of times. It was called "Whackin' Off." With hindsight, that's honestly way less embarrassing than Young Werther.TranslationI read the Corngold translation, which comes with an awful but apt Twilightish cover. It reads well.
