I read the Picador volumes - I was in Japan at the time and I asked my late mother to send them - and I was so enraptured by the prose (in translation of course) and the content - there is so much going on, it is not just about the story - Musil was a philosopher. This work is in the league of the greatest 20th century novels, it is not a question of having to read it, it is just a question of when will you read it - and reread it.
