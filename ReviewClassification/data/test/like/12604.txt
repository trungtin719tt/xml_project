Aw, that was just so DAAAAANG adorable. I just want to hold this book and talk with an American TWAAAAANG. (You totally need to read this with a Southern accent, got it? Which is hilarious, really, considering I'm an Aussie and my "southern accent" probably sounds like a frog getting murdered. But whatever.)I absolutely had to read this because I adore the movie.I'm really surprised how similiar they were. They movie basically followed the plot line-for-line. Awesome!So the whole time I had these pictures in my head:(Isn't Annasophia Robb so little? Awk.)It was like speed-reading the movie. But, okay. Shall we sort of review it now? Just a little bit.Writing?It's super easy to read. It's in first person, and very intimate with India Opal's thoughts. I read it in under an hour. (It's about 180 pages.)Plot?It's cute. It's interesting seeing the author set up the plot twists and tying everything together. Really well done, but (if you're a book nerd like me) a bit predictable. I loved the twinkling of history.Oh! And the characters were fabulous.I loved how each character had something to contribute. And no one was who they were assumed to be. The annoying boys actually wanted to be friends with India Opal. The snobby girl was actually grieving. The "witch" was actually a nice old woman who couldn't see. The author introduced a lot of sterotypes and dealt with them, which was refreshing.Totally wonderful book! LOVED it.Who's up to watch the movie? Bring out the popcorn! And someone, please, get me a smiling dawg!
