My first read by this author and it definitely won't be my last. Felt like this was two stories held together by the indefatiable Jean Paget, she certainly is a wonderful, well written character. Loved out narrator Noel, the older, gentlemanly London soliciter who administers the estate left to Jean from an uncle she little remembers. There are no gimmicks here, just some good, old fashioned story telling with the added bonus of one learning quite a bit about Malaya, though the events here were actually perpetuated in Sumatra, and about Australia and the ghost towns left empty after the gold Rush. The author explains this and also that Jean's character was created to honor the very real woman who went through what Jean does after the Japanese invasion. It is no wonder then that I felt this part of the book was written the best.Queensland, Australia and the stations at Wells town is the setting for the second half, connected of course by Jean and a person she meets in Malaya. He will be the reason she travels to Australia where she will make the most of her inheritance by improving the town she will soon call home. I love her character, she never gives up, plans and changes thing not to her liking and at a time when not many women had the ways nor means to do these things. I enjoyed this story immensely and loved the feelings ng I got while reading this story, especially the second half where Jean really comes into her own. Plenty of good stuff here and look forward to reading others by this author.
