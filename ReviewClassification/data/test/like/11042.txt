I've been trying to figure out what to say, write, or do in response the continuing cases of violence against black men by police in this country, the whole time feeling that I lacked a language or a reference point. Once again, literature is my way in to at least trying to understand a complex and foreign issue to me and it came at just the right time.That's basically me trying to fancy up saying: read this now if you haven't already.Bigger Thomas is a marginalized, poor young black man (his age comes up later and he's only 20 by the end of the novel) living in the South Side of Chicago, who gets a job with a wealthy white family in order to get his entire family off of "relief". He's contemplated some small robberies with his friends in the neighborhood and has been to reform school in Mississippi, so he's no angel. On the other hand, he is placed in a position where he knows his life is not his own, and he has to negotiate a world, while he is working in the Dalton's household, that is totally foreign to him, where he is forced to confront his marginalized status every minute he's there.There's the Dalton family's paternalistic "we give money to the poor" sympathy, the Communist "Red race propaganda" side, and by the end the lynch mob violence all swirling around with someone who is meant to be both representative of the mindset all young men like Bigger Thomas but also challenging the assumptions that just because he is black he will behave a certain way.The newspaper reports during the trial were some of the hardest parts to read. There is naturally the classic racist caricaturizing of Bigger, and when it comes down to it, it's eerily parallel to what happened during the Michael Brown murder grand jury: if a black man is portrayed as scary enough (completely forgetting the facts as they stand of a case) then the jury is frightened into behaving almost no better than a lynch mob. It's not a one to one parallel between Bigger Thomas(view spoiler)[ who did in fact murder Mary Dalton and Bessie, since the reader was there with him for both(hide spoiler)]and Michael Brown, but the rhetoric surrounding the black man involved in both is eerily similar.Another point that explicitly involves discussing details of the plot later on:(view spoiler)[ What was particularly uncomfortable was knowing that Bigger did murder two women, even if he didn't rape them or commit the other crimes he is accused of in the end by the police. He's guilty and even without strong evidence, let alone the barely any evidence besides a confession the prosecution was able to obtain, the reader knows that he's guilty. It's an interesting experiment in compassion for Bigger Thomas and an interesting choice by the author to make it so the readers are not blindly rooting for Bigger Thomas or completely condemning him.(hide spoiler)]A timely, important read.
