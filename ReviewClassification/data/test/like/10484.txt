I can tell this series is going to be a fun ride because there are so many great characters still to explore. Rhage is the centerpiece of this book and as a result most of the action does take place in the bedroom. However there is still a lot of humour and a lot of camaraderie between the Brothers and their close friends. Kudos to the author for the way she manages to get over the problem of a human partnering a vampire i.e. the human's much shorter time line. It was very cleverly done. This book was such an easy read it practically read itself and I am very keen to get to the next one!
