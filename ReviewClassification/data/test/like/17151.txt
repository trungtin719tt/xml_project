YOU GUYS WE ARE GETTING A NETFLIX TV SERIES AHHHHHHHHhttps://deadline.com/2019/01/netflix-...I CAN'T BREATHEEEEEE.If I could give this series 6 stars.. or 7... or 8.... I would.One of my ALL time favorite series. I get so sad when I see people totally skipping this to go to Six of Crows (which I loved, don't get me wrong.) True, it isn't for everyone.. but my gosh it is a work of art. I love everything about this series. (Ps... I'll say it again, butI HIGHLY recommend the audiobooks for enhanced experience.)For those of you who would like to take the Darkling with you in the car on the way to work in the mornings, or for those of you who want to get a feel for the legit badassery that is this series.. here's aSpotify PLAYLIST!!;) ;)So let me try to put my love for this book into a few categories.Overall Plot + ThemeAlright. I don't want to go over the details of the plot in this review -- because I went into this not knowing one darn thing about it so every single page was a surprise for me! What I will say is this... this book will be a wild ride in a dark fairytale-esque world with unpredictable characters. There is action, magic, romance, intrigue.. and really.. what more could you want from a series? I was absolutely 100% entranced with every page that I read... and that feeling continued with the second and third book.But I will say this... just when I thought I knew what was going on... just when I thought I was safe... well, Leigh Bardugo, you got me.THAT PLOT TWIST THO....AND MY FEELINGS AFTER THAT....I found myself jumping out of my bed screaming.. LITERALLY screaming... "Run Alina run!!!" or "Give in Alina, just give in!"The World-buildingIf I could get stuck in any world from any book- this would be the one. It is vivid, dark, magical, and completely entrancing.Here's the thing. I've read a lot of negative reviews basing their reasons on the fact that Leigh Bardugo didn't make a convincing Russian world... but my opinion is that his is her world- not actual Russia- she can do whatever she wants! Sure it has Russian inspiration, but it is clearly its own place. Maybe if you are really attached to the Russian language, it would bother you... but my opinion is to leave preconceived notions aside and let this be what it is.The CharactersAlina, our heroine.As with many first books, she needs to grow up some. She is fairly naive, but I liked growing up with her through this series. She's very relatable, in my opinion, darn right hysterical. She's very common with familiar insecurities that we all face. She gets a lot of grief for the mistakes she makes in this book...but come on ladies- I think we would all make the same mistakes she makes, if put in her situation.She will always be one of my favorite heroines because of how relatable she is. I adore her.On that note...(view spoiler)[Like for real... if someone like the Darkling is taking an interest in you... look me in the eyes and tell me you wouldn't act EXACTLY as she acts. And for Mal... the poor girl is heartbroken. Leave her alone. She grows up!(hide spoiler)]The DarklingI'm not going to say too much about him other than this. He is without a doubt the most interesting character I've ever read about.Ladies, good luck.Honestly I wish I could put some of my favorite quotes from the book here, but it would spoil.I can't even go into the rest of the characters without spoiling. Just enjoy trying to predict everyone!The MAGIC!![image error]This is my favorite magic system out of any book. I think that stems from me being an artist. The way Leigh describes the powers that some of the characters *cough* have.. its so unique and abstract... like a painting. And classes of magic? Freaking sweet.The WritingThis series overall is probably the most quotable one out there, in my opinion anyway. Simply gorgeous. And the pacing? I don't know how some people think this is slow... the pace was like.. holy freaking I can't keep up with my emotions...The AUDIOBOOK!I don't always recommend the audiobook version of a book to people- but the narrator who does this series is PHENOMENAL. It for sure enhanced my experience of this book 100000%. So yes, I HIGHLY recommend giving the audiobook a go!So to summarize all of my thoughts...Thank you Leigh Bardugo for this precious gift. Thank you.And just a hint for the next book... it may or may not introduce my next all time favorite character...;) ;) DON'T STOP HERE!!My Blog~Instagram~Twitter~Etsy
