"Something bad happened."Are you ready for a faster-paced, creepierGone Girl?Woah. This is one unsettling little thriller and the best bit about it is thatno one can be trusted, including the three female narrators who share the storytelling of this book. I literally read this entire novel in one sitting and I now need to find the words to convince you to go get your hands on it. RIGHT NOW.Between an alcoholic, a liar and a cheat,who can you trust?These are the three women at the centre of this book: Rachel, Anna and Megan.Have you ever sat on the train, glanced at the people around you or out of the window, and made up stories about them? Maybe you've even gone so far as to invent names for these people and imagine their perfect or not-so-perfect lives.Rachel is that girl on the train who takes her mind off her own life by imagining the lives of others. Specifically the lives of "Jess and Jason" who live at the house outside her train window when the train stops at the same red signal every morning. But then one morning, things are not as they are supposed to be and Rachel sees something that completely shatters the "Jess and Jason" image which exists in her head.Now she is pulled into their lives. Unsure exactly what she knows but certain she cannot rest until she finds out.This book is just full of secrets.Everyone has them. It's about all the little mysteries that exist just outside of what we see on the surface. What goes on behind closed doors? How much can you ever really know a person? What horrors exist in that black spot of your memory from Saturday night?It was fascinating, gripping and oh so very creepy.Hawkins has been added to the small group of thriller authors on my "must buy" list.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Tumblr
