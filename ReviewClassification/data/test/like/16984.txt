A story I followed breathlessly from page one until I remembered that I was supposed to figure out its plot and all that jazz. I forgot. I got sucked in. I don't remember the last time I was so engrossed. An eleven-year old kid against lawyers and FBI and mafia. And one very dead body hidden in a secret place. And everyone trying to find the body. And the kid and the killer the only ones who know where it's at. What's not to like? One of those books you want to swallow in one sitting.
