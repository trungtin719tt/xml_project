A combination of King's The Stand, McCarthy's The Road, and the movie I Am Legend.Very engrossing; the first third reads like sci-fi thriller, thoroughly setting up the scenarios of the plague that alters the world. I enjoyed the small details of the future world; no spoilers, but look for the name of the Texas governor and certain details about evacuation plans and state secessions.Unlike others, I enjoyed the second third the best. I found the society and government established to precariously survive this new and dangerous world was very well constructed, and grew to care about all of these characters. Knowing now that the book is the first in a trilogy, I think Cronin would have been better served ending the first here, with central characters departing on their heroes' journey.The last third just seemed rushed to me. Too many characters resolving too neatly; too many details about the viral plague explained mystically, rather than scientifically. Above all, I found myself very frustrated by the end. I know that some of these answers may be resolved by Book 2, but would love anyone's theory about just this one sentence from page 759: "Like Peter, what he was. For Amy believed Alicia knew that, too." Huh? Was this something I was supposed to understand from all that had come before, or something that has to wait for Book 2?Also, was anyone else bothered by all the typos and misprints in Chapter 19?
