4 StarsThis book a really good and it was a great love story. I am happy the Richard and Julie never ended up together at the end because I feel like Richard was not really a good match for Julie. He is way different then Mike. Mike and Julie and great together. Mike is a down to earth kind of guy that cares for Julie and Richard is a person that has money and treats her like royalty, but in a way he seems like he cares for Julie. Through out this book I thought that Mike and Julie are perfect for each other. My thoughts about them never changed. Towards the end I would change is that Julie's dog Singer passes away because of old age. If I had written this book I would have Singer live, even Singer had a great home and parents and also a great life. It was well written that I felt like that I was in Julie's place and I could feel the way she did and their connection between each other. I really cried during that part on a good way.
