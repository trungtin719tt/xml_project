My 2012 two cents: I just about peed my pants with this one!My 2017 two cents and five mills: just re-listened to this last week, which is kind of appropriate this time of year, and I loved it just as much the second time around, if not more. The fun never seems to stop giving with these books, really. Actually, I finished it while I was doing my cardio at the gym, and people must have thought I had a few screws loose, laughing as I was on the treadmill for, at least to them, no reason at all. I mean, Death filling in for Santa during Christmas (aka Hogswatch on the Discworld) is in itself hilarious, but this book delivers so much more in terms of acutely-studied parallels with our own world that it takes the definition of satire to a whole new level, making it nothing short of a masterpiece of British humor. Probably my favorite Discworld novel ever!
