I find it really hard to give a book five stars these days. It really has to earn it and truthfully, Poison Study almost did.The writing was surprisingly rich and colourful, the characters were great. Yelena was calculating and resourceful which I really liked. Valek was great. At some points he was your stock-standard superhero, protective saviour cliche but his loyalty, dedication and sneakyness really added some more dimensions to that.The plot... oh, the plot! Okay, in some instances it was really, really great. Except the big reveal was painfully, painfully obvious. I don't want to spend umpteen chapters screaming at the characters about what the beans are and how they're connected to everything. If it's that flipping obvious then, as an author, you need to be just a little more sneaky.Other than that is was a really enjoyable read and I'll definitely be picking up the next one in the series.
