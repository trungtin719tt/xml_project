From lovelorn soldiers, knee-deep in French mud, to privileged ladies taking tea in Blighty,Birdsongis a war story that appeals to both sexes. Class war/ real war; there are so many dimensions to this thunderous epic.Through unaffected prose, Faulks manipulates our emotions in a way that few authors can.My wife proclaims this to be her most favourite read, and were she to have typed this review, it would have attracted an easy five stars.
