Helen Keller had a severe illness at 19 months old which left her deaf and blind. It is hard to imagine losing one of those senses but to lose both must have been such an unbearable sensory deprivation. So understandable that(view spoiler)[ Helen felt the need to lock her mother in her room(hide spoiler)]Luckily for Helen she had an understanding family wealthy enough for a tutor who helped her to learn all the subjects a hearing and sighted child would learn and more. An inspiring book full of evocative descriptions. I would like to have had more information on the teaching methods, I can understand how a doll could be passed and 'doll' written on Helen's palm, but I would have been very interested how words involving concepts were learnt.There is a shocking episode involving a court case against Helen at the age of 12 which is unbelievable. She achieved an amazing amount in the period the book covered, I would love to read how Helen's life progressed after her early 20's.
