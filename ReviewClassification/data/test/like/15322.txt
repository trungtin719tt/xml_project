The more I read this series, the more I like it. I've kinda stopped comparing it to the tv show now.......kinda.**SPOILERS**Sookie finds herself in more supernatural trouble. The weres are being murdered, the vamps face a hostile takeover, Bob finally becomes a man again - an angry one and Eric remembers.She also dumps Quinn which I was gutted about. A stupid reason as well, he put his family first. Not being funny Sook but he's only known you about 5 mins, it's not like you're married or anything, why wouldn't his family come first? However this breakup does make way to more potential romance with Eric. And I'm not saying no to page time with Eric.I also really like the witches and I'm glad they are living with Sookie, I hope we see more of them and they don't rush back to New Orleans.
