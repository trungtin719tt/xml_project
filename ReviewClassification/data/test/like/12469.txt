The Two Towersis the second novel of the trilogy The Lord of the Rings. The companions are split to do their own bidding for the cause against darkness that is coming over their world. One group fights Saruman. The other group searches their way to Mordor with the ring's burden. What perils await? Will they come out on top?*Smacks face with book and cries out "I LOVE YOU"*This is one of the greatest novels that I have ever read. I bet everything has been said about this trilogy, so I will try to keep it as short as possible. J.R.R Tolkien has another huge fan. Furthermore, I never want to watch the movies ever again, because this book is GREAT. From the first chapter I was under Tolkien's spell. It was a lot more actioned pack and a lot more fun to read compared to the first book. I did not find it parts boring unlike inThe Fellowship of the Ring. The writing did make me sleepy, which caused me to only read two chapters at a time. His writing is very detailed, but beautify written. I could imagine every crook and nanny, all the fields of battlement, the lush forest, and whatever in between. I will say this again that Tolkien has an amazing imagination, and he made an entrancing world for his characters. It still amazes me.I love all the companions. I would love to hug them all. All of them play to their strengths and have the moral courage to fight back against the evil that lurks. They all put a smile on my face. I love Sam and Frodo's relationship. Sam would do absolutely anything for Frodo. As I recall, Frodo is a lot more weaker in the movie than in the novel. I like Frodo in the novel, and I wish the movie made him a little bit more stronger. BUT there is a new race that tops over them all, and it is the Ents. I love the Ents. I love how relax they are, and how passionately they feel for their fellow trees. "Do not be so hasty." I would love to meet an Ent, if they were real. Even Smeagol I have pity for.Sorry to go back to science, but I can't help but notice sometimes. Thinking about science makes me happy. I started thinking about natural selection and what traits were being passed down to the races. I noticed this when Treebeard was asking Merry and Pip about Entwives. Legolas has far sight, great hearing, fair skin, and soft feet. The Hobbits short, light footed, and good hearing. Those traits were passed on from generation to generation, and it is helping them survive. NATURAL SELECTION FOLKS! The Hobbits are not the greatest fighters, so they can hide easier in smaller places to avoid the enemies. Elves protect their homes, so they have qualities of fighters in night or day. GOSH that made me very happy.I can't wait to read theReturn of the Kingnext month, but I will be really sad for it to end. The series has been amazing so far and I just don't want it to end. I absolutely love it! This review and the one on my blog are practically the same, but incase you forgot visit my site. hahahttp://dancingbetweenthecovers.com/re.... If not, oh well. Read well folks!
