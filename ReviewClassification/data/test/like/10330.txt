Another re-read of 2018, there is definitely a lot to love aboutDrums of Autumneven after all these years. Now that Claire and Jamie are reunited and in America, a whole set of new and exciting adventures and new characters await one of my favorite literary couples. Claire and Jamie have spent 20 years apart and have never really had the chance to be a couple in a marriage. So I think it's definitely a gift of the latter books that we see them actually have a change to "settle down."Another snippet of Drums that sets it apart is that while we have Jamie and Claire in 18th century America, Diana also gives us the building relationship between Brianna and Roger in the 20th century. Initially, in my very first reading of the book which was many years before Goodreads, I was afraid that DG might possibly be relegating C&amp;J to the background and offering readers a new couple to root for and give adventures too. How foolish, right? I quickly realized that what DG was actually signaling is thatshe wasn't done telling us about this world she had built.But in my defense, it was because Ireally wasn't overjoyed with Brianna and Roger.So many things infuriated me in regards to them and it wouldn't be until book 6 that I would begin cutting them some slack. But I digress...Now in an effort to keep things spoiler free because season 4 is slated for late fall and I am sure people are getting prepared to dive into book 4, I won't delve more than the above into the synopsis. Rest assured, book 4 offers a lot of surprises that still managed to tug at my heartstrings and help me fall deeper into the Outlander universe. It's also the 1st book that I must confess that another character managed to steal some of the limelight from Jamie Fraser. His nephew, Young Ian Murray!
