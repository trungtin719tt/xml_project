Where should I start? This trilogy is so action-packed and I always need to hold my breath because I have no idea what'll happen when I turn the next page. If you haven't read Legend, GO READ IT. The characters are amazing and the plot is so genious! This gets easily 5 stars from me. There are so many twists that everytime you think everything's good, something happens. That's why I couldn't put this down.Now I'll go to the SPOILERS. If you haven't yet read Prodigy and don't want to be spoiled, I suggest you to stop reading.54321Okay then.So let's talk about the ending.(view spoiler)[ WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT????? I was so sure everything was going to be alright and then THAT HAPPENED.That was so heartbreaking to read how June really thought that Day didn't want to be with her because of her actions. I STILL REFUSE TO BELIEVE THAT DAY'S DYING. LIKE, NO. NOPENOPENOPE. I just need to read the sequel NOW. If they don't get their happy ending and if Day won't tell June about him... I'm just gonna cry in the corner like forever.(hide spoiler)]And then there's Tess. I like her so much!(view spoiler)[ But I did not see her crush on Day coming at all. I think it was kinda adorable and their relationship is so real. It hurt to read when she didn't want to follow Day anymore. I hope we'll see her more in Champion and I want her to be happy. She deserves it.(hide spoiler)]What do you guys think of Anden? I have so many mixed feelings towards him.(view spoiler)[ I want to believe him, I really do, but something's still bugging me about him. He clearly has some feelings for June, though. I really hope I'm not completely wrong about him and that he'll change the country. Also, I actually liked Kaede too so her death came out of the blue. Man, aren't there anyone I didn't like??(hide spoiler)]I guess these were the only things that come to my mind now. I'm still a little bit shocked. I need some time to recover, haha.
