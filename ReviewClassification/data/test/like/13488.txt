After reading Bared To You, I fell in love with Gideon and Eva and became a HUGE fan of Sylvia Day. I could not wait for Reflected In You and I was so not disappointed!! This is such an AWESOME book and it might even be my favorite of the two so far and that is saying something because I have some mad crazy love for Bared To You!! After finishing Reflected In You all I want to do is go back and reread the series. I am not ready to leave Gideon and Eva. I just can't get enough of them and December is way to long of a wait to get my fix!! LOL ;)Reflected In You definitely has a place in my keeper pile.This book wore me out!! I was emotionally spent after reading. I had forgot not only what a messed-up relationship Eva and Gideon had, but also how much baggage weighed each of them down. They were just such lovable damaged characters that my heart ached reading this story. It was hard to read them struggle to hold on to each other while battling their insecurities. I just wanted to shake them and then hug them!! LOL"But here I was, constantly awed by the gorgeousness of the complicated, frustrating, messed-up, sexy-as-sin man I was falling deeper in love with every day.""You hit me the instant I saw you," he said gruffly. "I couldn't look away. I wanted you immediately. Excessively. Almost violently.""Looking at you for the first time made me think about sex. Screaming, sheet clawing sex." (Eva to Gideon)"I saw that." His hands slid up either side of my spine. "And I knew you saw me, too. Saw what I am...what I have inside me. You saw right through me.""No one's ever seen before, Eva. You're the only one.""The simple fact was, Gideon and I were the best and worst things that had ever happened to each other."Both Eva and Gideon had some scenes that surprised me and left me talking to my Kindle. This was when my heart ached the most and I wanted to just shake them because if they would have just opened up to each other, especially Gideon, and trusted each other, these things could have been avoided. But I guess that really is the whole basis of Reflected In You. Gideon and Eva struggling to trust each other with their secrets and insecurities to build a stronger healthier relationship. I loved how Eva stood up for Gideon against the people who had wronged him in his life. So good!!!"Are you hurt anywhere else?" I asked, feeling so emotionally raw after the long night we'd had. He caught my wrist and pulled my hand down to press flat over his heart. "Here." *sigh* *cries*"Look what it's doing to me! I hurt you last might. On purpose. Without even realizing it, because the resentment is eating at me even while I'm convincing myself that I can live with everything you're not telling me." (Eva to Gideon)"Don't you have enough to look past as it is? How much shit can I pile on you before you run like hell?"(Gideon to Eva)I absolutely love Gideon. I love his crazy-sexy-hot-possessive-sweet-caring-controlling-arrogant-jealous ways. And I love Eva and all her fun-sweet-loving-caring-insecure-jealous ways. They really are the perfect match for each other. I have to say that I am not a huge fan of Cary and especially not after the concert incident, in which if he had just warned Eva, that whole situation could have been avoided!!! UGH!!Reflected In You had some really funny moments between Gideon and Eva. The incident at the pool in Vegas and how Eva got back at Gideon for it and how Gideon reacted to what she did in return, was so funny~loved it!! They also had some really sweet, tender, heartwarming moments that left me a puddle of goo!! LOL"I'd rather argue with you, angel, than laugh with anyone else."*sigh*"You're the greatest risk I've ever taken." He pressed his lips gently to mine. "And the greatest reward.""I was his safe place, which made me rare and invaluable to him."Of course I couldn't end my review without talking about the sex. One of the things that I love about Gideon is that he is a dirty-talker and likes to take control in the bedroom or limo or shower or plane(you get the picture);) Wow...Sylvia Day can definitely write some SMOKIN-HOT, DIRTY, SEXY, PANTY-MELTING, DROOL-WORTHY, SIGH-INDUCING SEX scenes. The scenes in the shower, limo, concert, and on the plane nearly set my Kindle on fire!!! ;) (trust me you want to read these scenes~maybe even highlight them!!) LOL ;)"You on your period?" I nodded. "Then I'll just have to come in your mouth." (Gideon to Eva~That's Gideon for you!!) LOL ;0There isn't really anymore to say after that!! LOL ;)BEST OF THE BEST rating!!!***ARC provided by NetGalley and Penguin Group(USA)~Thank you so much!!
