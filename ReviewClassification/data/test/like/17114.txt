Book Review4 out of 5 stars toThe Stinky Cheese Man and Other Fairly Stupid Tales, a re-appropriation of classic fairy tales, published in 1992 byJon Scieszka. What a hilarious book! Sometimes the classics need a little refresher, and when you add a dose if stupid and fun humor, how can you go wrong? The author and the artist have created a superb work for modern times, where children can easily do a read and compare between the versions of centuries ago and the modern re-telling that stand alongside. Not for the faint of heart, especially if you don't want to see some of your favorite characters pushed and pulled a little! It's one of those books where you just need to relax and enjoy it -- don't get caught up in the craziness of what the author's done or said. Think of it as a way to compare old and new... and when the kids are old enough, it might be a tool to help them learn to love analyzing literature and comparing two things that are similar but very different.
