How do you know when a book is a great book?- When the line between reality and fiction begins to blur, so that you could be sitting on a sunny balcony off a busy street, and still feel like you are in the cool, dark confines of the ancient Irish forests. When you are struck with sympathetic muteness because talking means the difference between life and death for the heroine, and it takes an actual, conscious effort to unlock your throat and answer when someone calls out to you. When you suddenly find that your usually limitless supply of words has run out altogether, and you can't find the words to describe how this book made you feel.I am not going to talk about characterization, worldbuilding, plotline, or any of the things I usually talk about in my reviews. Although they were all brilliant. I am not going to gush about the romance between Sorcha and Hugh, although it is more than gush-worthy. What I am going to do, is tell you how this book affected me. Profoundly. Personally.I have a weakness for Irish legends. I love the terrible beauty and darkness of the Fair Folk. I love the cadences of the story-telling, though it might seem long and tedious to some people. A lot of the story-telling in this book reminded me of the rhythm and style ofCecilia Dart-Thornton's Bitterbynde Trilogy. The fae of these stories are not the sexy, playful, almost-human faeries of the Urban Fantasy world. They are the real thing, powerful, removed and only concerned with humans as playthings, or pawns in the game of fate. And Marillier gets that.A lot of people will find The Daughter of the Forest heavy going. The tone of the book is portentous and the style of writing is almost bardic. Things move slowly, but there is beauty in the slow pace.This book resonated on a level I find difficult to explain. I cried when Sorcha cried, I hurt when she hurt, I shivered when she feared and I loved when she loved. It was almost as if I was absorbing her character, becoming her in one sense. And this is where truly great story-telling lies, in the ability to divorce you from reality, so that you can't think about whether you love or hate a character, because you are practically one entity. In the ability to transport you to another land, and make you love its people, until they feel like your people. In the ability to move you to the extent where words become impossible, even unnecessary because the silent places in your soul have come alive.I think I would never be able to objectively recommend The Daughter of the Forest to anybody. The act of reading it was too personal, the story too close to my heart, to be able to judge with any accuracy whether it will be to someone else's taste. All I can do, in my measly way, is give it five stars, and hope this review resonates with someone out there someday!
