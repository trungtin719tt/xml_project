I would say that as a general "life rule" it would be a good idea to keep out of immortal wars when you are a human. You're gonna get your ass kicked while all the supernatural creatures can just heal, and can't easily die. Of course, Sookie is still kind of a dumbass, and finds herself in the middle of a fairy war. This is after being in a vampire war and werewolf war.All we need to make this party better is a stupid redneck girl..The best part of this book is that Sookie finally starts to come around to my point of view and gets together with Eric. And, of course, Eric is awesome! Even if he tricks her into a vampire marriage of sorts, he does it to protect her."Eric, when I'm back to being myself, I'm going to nail your ass for putting me in this position of being pledged to you.""Darling, you can nail my ass anytime," he said charmingly...some offers are just too good to refuse...(there, I have included my mandatory Eric gif. And, yes, I made it mandatory myself. It's one of my "life rules".)So, Sookie is knee-deep in fae politics, but don't worry, she filled a squirt-gun with lemon juice and carries it on her at all times. She's a badass...or just annoying...You didn't know that lemon juice will kill a faery? Neither did anyone else.But, shockingly, the fae still get hold of her and torture her. I was very conflicted on whether or not I gave a crap about her being tortured. She's not the most likable heroine.Bless your heart...So, we'll see what happens to Sookie next. I'm guessing she will get involved with a Zombie War at the Piggly Wiggly or something like that.well, at least Sookie will be safe
