Typical Sarah Dessen fare - fervent, fluffy, and full of superbly developed characters. This one was not her best, but still extremely enjoyable and well worth the time reading it.The book revolves around Ruby, a seventeen-year-old girl who had been living with her mother, until she is abandoned when her mom walks right out the door. She planned to live on her own and move out when she turned eighteen, but is found out and as a result must live with her long-lost sister, Cora. Cora has established herself in a new life with a furnished home and her wealthy husband, Jamie. Ruby also meets Nate, the amazingly friendly boy next door, whose nice nature may hide something underneath. Ruby gradually comes to accept her new life and deal with her struggles from the past.Dessen's utilization of the lock and key metaphor throughout the book never ceased to amaze me. She managed to incorporate the theme everywhere, which was impressive, but became a bit overdone at some points. However, I would highly recommend this one if you are aching for another heartfelt story from a strong writer.
