it was the summer of 1928, way before Radio or TV were part of our life. 12 year old Douglas spent that summer exploring his small town and its people. He started jotting down his "discoveries and revelations" in a notepad so that he won't forget about them. We through him met extraordinary people of this small town. A man adamant on making a Happiness Machine, an old woman who thought that she had met her lover from her past life, going away of a dear friend, last ride on the trolley, and magical kitchen and many more stories. Each story was unique in its own way and was connected to other stories.this was my first Bradbury and it won't be my last. I fell in love with how beautifully and smoothly he mixed these simple stories with magic. he made me feel like a child who was listening to these stories before sleeping at night and who in dream would revisit this magical world.this story has all the right elements in the right proportion that made me squeal, jubilant, scared, mad, lonely, hungry, and love like a child.highly recommended!
