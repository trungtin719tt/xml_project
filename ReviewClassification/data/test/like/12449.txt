4.5 I love Rehvenge Stars!!Where to start.....RehvI loved Rehv's story. It was so heartbreaking to see what he has been subjected to over the years with the Princess blackmailing him and what he has been forced to endure to protect who he and Xhex are. After he meets Ehlena, he wants nothing more than to have as much of a normal life as a Symphath can with anyone. He doesn't believe that he is good enough for her though.Ehlena has always found Rehv intriguing. With her father's bad health and her being the only supporter of the family, she doesn't think she has the time or the energy to commit to a relationship, but with Rehv, there's something more about him.There is a lot going on in the Brotherhood right now. The war against the Lessers is escalating and Brothers dealing with past hurts. It just keeps getting better and better.Next up is John Matthew and Xhex's story....
