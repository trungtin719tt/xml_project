One of my all-time fav books. The first time I read it, I bought it from the bookstore at Indro shopping centre (before it closed down...sigh!!) one Saturday afternoon with my ex husband (husband at the time...another sigh!), then went home, went to bed, didn't sleep that night and read it all in one sitting. I was blown away by it then, and even named my daughter after one of the characters (Cherry).Rereading it now, it hasn't lost any of its power and beauty. I find it's really a book about the kindness of strangers...it has so many heartbreaking moments, but you go from sad to hopeful within seconds, from the good in the characters and the author's beautiful writing.Reading it again I wish it were a longer book...now I feel it goes from one scene, or tragic or good, event to the next too quickly. More, I want more!! Only cause it is so damn good.My heart hurts after reading this, but it hurts in a good way! Read the book to understand :)I ordered her only other book, The Honk and Hollar Opening Soon, and it arrived today. Dying to jump straight into it, but with only two books by this amazingly talented author, I may need to cherish and save it for another lazy Saturday afternoon. She may never write another novel!Now that is heartbreaking.
