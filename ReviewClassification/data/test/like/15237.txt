I have to say I don't think I haveeverread a novel with such an accurate view of the world. With the exception of little details that dated the novel, I felt like I was seeing (reading?) a snapshot of New York today. Not that it doesn't apply to the rest of the country. If you look at Wolfe's portrayal of the media, the authorities, and race relations and then take a look at your community, you'll see the similarities.As I was taking a quick break from Trollope, it was refreshing to see a novel where characters are neither wholly good nor wholly bad. It's hard to even pass judgement on Sherman by the end. (Although interestingly, the reason I even picked this up is because I kept reading articles that equated the amoral Sherman McCoy with the Wall Street crowd that apparently single-handedly brought the economy crashing down on us. Apparently they over-simplified their reading of the novel in the same way they over-simplified their analysis of the financial crisis.)
