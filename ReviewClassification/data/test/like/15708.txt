Genre: Adventure, Travel.Publication Date: 1873Fun and refreshing.- A short and a light hearted read, you can go through the book in no time and the 80 days goes by in a jiffy.- The events in the book are fast paced and so is the journey of Mr. Phileas Fogg and Mr. Passeportout.- Is he just a gentleman trying to prove a point or a criminal mastermind on the run?- Mr. Fogg has set up a wager with his rich friends that he/anyone can travel the world in 80 days.- He doesn't spend time worrying about something that may or may not happen, he just takes informed actions and finds a way to do the things anyway.- I wish to travel the world in a similar fashion! It would be fun!
