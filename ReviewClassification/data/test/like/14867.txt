***groan*** Kellan POV of the 'rain scene' in Thoughtless (spoilers, so don't read if you haven't read Thoughtless yet!)http://www.fictionpress.com/s/3089151/6/It has taken me a LONG time to find some photos that represent my image of Kellan... and I think I've found them... SO. FUCKING. SEXY.3/1/2013 - Even better the third time! GOD I LOVE KELLAN/JARED!10/27/2012 - And.... now that I've given y'all a good indication of my image of Kellan, here's the rest of the picture...Alibi - 30 Seconds to Mars (how I imagine him singing at the end of Thoughtless) What I wouldn't give for a good video clip of this...http://open.spotify.com/track/0VMGkTg...6/29/2012 - how did I manage to cry even harder the second time I read this.... geez!6/25/2012 - Just shy of a month since I read this for the first time, and I am so Kellan-crazy that I totally need to re-read it... My tummy is all butterfly-ish all over again, and I haven't even re-read the first page yet!Oh my... oh my, oh my, oh my... I know some people had problems with this book... There were so many times I wanted to say "WTF are you thinking, Kiera!?!?" I put off reading this book because of the whole cheating aspect, but I am soooooooooooooo glad that I listened to suggestions from a few other readers. Heartbreaking, raw, painful to read at times... I loved the complexity and often hated that I loved it. I was so not comfortable with the behavior of the Kiera and felt just plumb awful for Denny and fell in love with Kellan. Wow.... Great GREAT book. I just finished it and have a huge bittersweet ache in my heart and a lump in my throat. Oh my, oh my, oh my...
