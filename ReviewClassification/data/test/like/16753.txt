With everything going on this week, I can't help but think that this novel is still timely and relevant after all these years.The book had a bit of a slow start for me. However, it was important for the author to fully describe exactly what life was like in British-controlled India, from where they lived to how they lived to who they interacted with and under what circumstances they were allowed to do so. Rampant racism and religious intolerance didn't only occur between the British and the Indians; they also divided Indians themselves. In situations like that, when a crime occurs, the lower classes are subject to profiling according to stereotypical untruths. Kinda sounds like something that happened yesterday.It did pick up later on, and I thoroughly enjoyed the book as a whole. Maybe one day we as a global society will be able to see and appreciate each other's differences. Maybe one day we will realize that different colors, religions, backgrounds, cultures, and beliefs help to paint a broader and more inclusive picture of humanity rather than insisting that only one color, one religion, one background, one culture, and one belief can be correct. Maybe one day people will stop saying, "I don't see color" and instead say "I see color, I appreciate the differences, we can learn from each other, and diversity is good." Until then, thank whatever god you worship (or don't worship, because that's okay, too) for novels like this.
