Once in a distant while there comes a novel that brings me to tears as I turn its final pages. It is the combination of a compelling story, vital characters, and sublime writing that fill me with awe at the writer's ability and sorrow in bidding farewell to such a treasure. Wallace Stegner'sCrossing to Safety, Jane Austen'sPride and Prejudice, Harper Lee'sTo Kill A Mockingbirdare a few that have made a powerful impact.Leif Enger'sPeace Like A Rivertouched me in a similar way. Less so for some of the story's elements, such as the Messianic qualities assigned to Jeremiah that clanged out of harmony with his more earthly physical and emotional fragility, or Davy's experiences at a South Dakota hideout that seemed to be lifted straight from Charles Frazier'sCold MountainAppalachia.But what writing. Boy oh boy. There were sections I read several times, wanting to snip them out and paste in a scrapbook of perfect phrasing, perfect sentences and paragraphs (I'm all about sentences now, thanks to Francine Prose!). The characters, from fully-formed Reuben and Swede to the more peripheral such as Dr. Nokes, Superintendent Holgren, lawyer DeCuellar and his angel of a wife, were flesh and blood in my mind's eye- voices I could hear, faces I could see, souls that were as open or as guarded as any in real life. The story was an homage to Americana, to the romance of the American west, and to the voices of children who have spoken through some of our nation's greatest writers: James Agee, Mark Twain, Harper Lee, Betty Smith, Maya Angelou, Salinger, Steinbeck.I'm late to the party in readingPeace Like A River- it was published in 2001 - so a little late in recommending this as a book club pick. It's probably been picked to death! But there are many themes- loyalty, justification for violence, Christianity, magic, loss of innocence and longing for a simpler time and simpler way of life-that would be great fodder for discussion._______________________________________Need some time to let this settle in, but without a doubt this is one of the most soul-touching books I've read in a good long while.
