In this saga, the prolific Grisham examines more closely than in his other novels the process of choosing a jury that can best respond to both the plantiff and the defendent without filling the 12 chairs with people who have too much natural prejudice for either side. The culprit on trial inThe Runaway Juryis the tobacco industry and the plaintiff is someone who lost a family member to lung cancer due to smoking. The process by which a certain man-woman team manages to gerrymander a jury in a series of clever and sneaky moves is really interesting. The film version, made around the turn of the century when school shootings were more of an emotional threat to the country than the sale of cigarettes, changed the guilty topic of the trial from smoking to gun control. I think this was high-handed, but ultimately more effective. Whether it's cigarettes or guns, there is going to be a lot of emotion among jurors, and these 12 people hold virtually all the power for the outcome. This book explains in a most interesting way how juries can be manipulated by both sides, and how smart, but unscrupulous and self-serving, people can benefit in a monetary way from their tricks.
