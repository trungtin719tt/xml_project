I bought this book merely because a girl in a bookstore approach me and asked me if I would like to buy her copy off her. She said she loved the book and she wanted money to buy another one of Jodi Picoult's books. I hadn't ever read anything of Picoult's before, I'd only heard that if you read My Sisters Keeper you should keep a box of tissues handy. I said yes, because hey its not every day that someone approaches me in a bookstore and I like a bit of spontaneity.It took me a while to bother starting this book (you know how it is, exams, study, tv shows...) but once I did, I was amazed. I fell in love with the book at the first page, and promptly fell in love with chris probably less than ten pages later. I hated Emily throughout most of the book, mainly for everything she put Chris through. Although she wasn't as horrible as her Mother, who just generally makes everyone's lives more difficult.This book had a strong impact on me. I loved the ending, I loved the trial and I felt it had a lot of passion in general. This is the best of Picoult's that I have read.**Soon after finishing The Pact, I wanted to get my hands on as many Picoult books as I could. This didn't turn out so well as I soon learnt that Jodi has a formula and boy does she stick to it. To me, she has found something that works and she drives it home with each and every book. Who could blame her? A little creativity would be nice now and then though.
