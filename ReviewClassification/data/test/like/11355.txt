Ah,The Return of the King. The end of a sweeping epic, one which held me firmly in its grasp as a child and still holds a place in my heart as an adult.Everything is in motion and actually coming to an end almost from the first page of this last book in the trilogy. Frodo is ever so close to completing his quest. Aragon, Gandalf and the others are nearly at the end of their rope. Indeed, the end is nigh!But this is not a quick finish. Tolkien dragged things out. There is a mini-battle after the great war has concluded. Many a loose end is tied up. The tearful goodbyes are interminable. I certainly didn't want it to end. I would've been happy if this series had continued on indefinitely. When I first read this as a young teen, I was a very slow reader. It took me nearly two years to finish and by then I was fully attached to these characters.That attachment began when I was about five years old, when I saw the Rankin Bass animated version of this book on TV. I cried like a baby when Frodo and Sam were trying to escape what appeared to be their inevitable death. I held on to that memory and supplemented it over the years with the other animated versions of Tolkien's Middle Earth series. So, by the time I got around to readingThe Lord of the Rings, I was as good as a card-carrying member of the fan club.Certainly this series isn't for everyone. I've heard many complain about it for various reasons: too many characters, an impenetrable backstory, etc. The recurring complaint that the books are too dense was something Tolkien was apparently aware of, because he included a very helpful appendix section at the back ofReturn...which answers some questions the reader may have as well as filling in more of the background details if you're confused or just interested in learning more.
