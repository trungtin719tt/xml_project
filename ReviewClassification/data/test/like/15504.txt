I had to read this for 11th grade English class. After we discussed it, our teacher brought in the Iron Maiden song and played it for us in class as it is the whole text of the poem. That was my introduction to Iron Maiden. I had seen the shirts for years and they were so gross the band scared me and I remember thinking that it was just louder music and not so scary after all.
