June 18, 2013This book has Dan Brown written all over it. Just like the previous stories in this series, the entire book is about 24 hour long mystery/thriller. Robert Langdon wakes up at a hospital with no recollection of how he got there and as he starts to figure out what's going on, he starts getting deeper into a dangerous event that is about to take place. From the very first page, a chain of events starts to take place at a very fast pace.Loved reading the book, just like Robert Langdon's previous journies. At the beginning I found it a little bit annoying when every single details of various Italian tourist spots were being described. Some of them were so descriptive that at times it felt like reading a brochure. The description of various historic places probably could've been shortend a little bit.The thriller never ends though. A lot of twists as the story progresses and that's what keep you turning the pages. It's a fast pace story, as mentioned and the story telling style of Dan Browne is absolutely amazing, as usual. A great read overall.January 15, 2013It's coming out on May and I can't believe this book wasn't added to Goodreads already. Couldn't find it in Goodreads and so I added the book. Can't wait for it to come out!!!
