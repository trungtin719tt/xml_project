Reread for our classics discussion on the blog!http://www.themidnightgarden.net/2015...--------------------------------------If you've never read Mary Poppins, you're missing out on one of the great classics of children's literature. It's been a long time since I've read these books that I loved so much as a child, but I immediately felt as though I was visiting with old friends.The thing of it is, I'm quite sure that I felt this way the very first time I read the book as well. P.L. Travers writes incredibly imaginative stories that tickle the fancy and will surprise even the most jaded reader. Many of the elements and events will be familiar to fans of the very fun Disney film (which did a wonderful job of capturing the spirit of the book while making the story their own), such as the chalk picture drawings, tea on the ceiling, and the Bird Woman. But readers also get to experience the magic ofgingerbreadwrapped in gilt paper stars that later get glued to the night sky, a funny night zoo in which the main attractions are people, the awful Bad Tuesday in which Michael is hateful to everybody because he just can't help it, and the tale of Mrs. Lark's Andrew, a silky little pampered pet who wants nothing more than to be a common dog.My favorite chapter in this book, however, is the bittersweet story of the twin babies John and Barbara, who delight in talking to the wind and the birds who visit them in their nursery. When they learn that one day they will no longer understand the language of their dearest friends, they weep piteously and are determined that they will never forget and they will never be changed. Not long afterwards, the jeering Starling comes to visit and wheedles a bit of treat from them, but they don't respond.--------------------------------------------------Book excerpt:The Starling stared at her. "Ha!" he said suddenly, and turned and looked inquiringly at Mary Poppins. Her quiet glance met his in a long look.Then with a darting movement, the Starling flew over over to John's cot and alighted on the rail. John had a large woolly lamb hugged close in his arms. "What's my name? What's my name? What's my name?" cried the Starling in a shrill, anxious voice."Er-rumph!" said John, opening his mouth and putting the leg of the woolly lamb into it.With a little shake of his head the Starling turned away. "So--it's happened," he said quietly to Mary Poppins.She nodded.The Staring gazed dejectedly for a moment at the Twins. Then he shrugged his speckled shoulders. "Oh, well--I knew it would. Always told them so. But they wouldn't believe it." He remained silent for a little while, staring into the cots. Then he shook himself vigorously."Well, well. I must be off. Back to my chimney. It will need spring cleaning, I'll be bound." He flew on to the window-sill and paused, looking back over his shoulder."It'll seem funny without them, though. Always liked talking to them--so I did. I shall miss them." He brushed a wing quickly across his eyes.--------------------------------------Written with brisk humor and deep tenderness, it's passages like these that stir a sweet ache in anyone who still longs to respond to the lovely, wondrous call of childhood.
