This is a very hard review for me to write. My mind is still reeling from the impact that this book had on me.The Sparrowis one of those books that I sit and wonder how on earth did the author conceive of the idea of the substance enclosed in these pages. I have never read anything likeMary Doria Russell'sThe Sparrow.Emilio Sandoz is a Jesuit priest but he is so much more. When extraterrestrial intelligence is confirmed and the Jesuits decide to go find the source of the "singing", this is something that the Jesuits have been preparing Emilio for his whole life. He has been assigned to every possible earth climate from Antarctica to the Sudan. He has linguistic abilities that have prepared him to learn alien languages. He also believes in doing all for the glory of God. Yet he is a fun person to be around, especially among his closest friends. This planned space mission is not through any government agency so picking the crew has different criteria. Most of the crew is made up of friends that Emilio has known for a long time. These are very intelligent, capable people, almost as if God had this planned. But don't be concerned that you are going to get hit over the head with religion in this book. God and religion are two different things. It is about Life and Friendship and Possibilities.The ending ofThe Sparrowmakes me very grateful that there is a second book to read,Children of God.The Sparrowis so unique and well written that I definitely want more. There are things that happen in this book that I would normally want to avoid but they are not pervasive.
