A good conclusion but I am so upset about my favorite character!!! :-((view spoiler)[Scott! RIP!! :-( I loved him!(hide spoiler)]I'm with everyone else when I say WTF?! 4th book in the Trilogy?!?!?!?!?!?After reading Silence there is a lot still open but I thought that was the last book. I can always use some more Patch and Scott though.
