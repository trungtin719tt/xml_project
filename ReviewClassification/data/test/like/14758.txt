"Wild Swans" (1991) has very helpful introductory notes. Because of the Chinese names, I was glad to know how to pronounce Jung=Yung, X=sh, Q=ch. The 2003 Introduction is added, in which she aims to write about "how the Chinese really felt" during the twentieth century through experiences of her grandmother, her mother, and herself. Especially interesting are the changing lives of women across three generations, which depict notions of beauty, concubinage, and foot-binding then community activism, and ultimately university education and study abroad. The historical epic must add to the plethora of facts an element of fiction as Chang was born half-way into the century.A lot of socio-political ground is covered about China: her people, her land, her revolutionary times of mismanagement and chaos, and her more stable times of productivity and order. A lot is dismal, and it's less entertaining than informative--how principles were sacrificed to expediency, how ruthlessness turned traditional values back to the middle ages, and how it all happened.
