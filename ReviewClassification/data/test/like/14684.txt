It's not often that I read a book or book series and am sad when I finish because I just don't want the journey to end. I was really sad at the end of the Millennium series. Larsson wove such an intriguing tale of Lisbeth Salander's life with a mix of political intrigue and conspiracy. I became completely engrossed in the story. The books are long but savory. It's difficult to imagine that Larsson just wrote these three books for fun and relaxation with no intent to publish. I think the thing that saddens me most is his untimely death and knowing he is no longer around to craft the continuing saga of Lisbeth and Michael when I'm still craving for more.
