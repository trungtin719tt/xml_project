I'm dying inside.This is such an epic fuckingSTORY.Like in the same way that Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings or Game of Thrones is a story.They all take storytelling to its most fundamental and beautiful form.This author is telling something, not a ego-filled conceptualization of their own fantasies filled with melodrama to cushion the lack of true plot. THERE IS ACTUALLY A STORY TO TELL.And holy fuck does Karen Marie Moning have stuff to say.Super recommend.
