Arthur Dent finds himself living alone on prehistoric Earth, in a cold, damp cave. His friend Ford Prefect, bored, has wandered off early without saying a word, to Africa, Arthur learns later. The duo time travelers are here not voluntarily, and have tried to adjust, the whole gang's been scattered all through the Galaxy not a fun situation. Marvin, the depressed but amusing robot, has conversations with a talking mattress in a strange planet, Trillian, at a party that never ends and Zaphod Beeblebrox, is sulking on the Heart of Gold, his spaceship ( almost, he "borrowed it")... a lonely man. Never too well does Mr.Dent live, he's no great farmer, or hunter not even very brave. Scraping just enough food, to survive in this alien world, yes, it's good old Terra, but to the Englishman might as well be Mars, and speaking to trees to keep from becoming, insane ? The only excitement, in the five stranded years here, ( or four?) came after a couple of trips around the Sun, sometime ago. A spaceship landed in front of Arthur's dull cave, and coming down the ramp a tall gray- green alien stranger said, "You're a jerk , Dent". The flabbergasted Arthur, mumbled some incoherent noises which should have been words, before the alien went up the ramp again and left as quickly as he arrived. This mysterious creature is an immortal, so lacking in things to do he has devised an activity, maybe not the most worthwhile he himself acknowledges, and quite impossible also. To go and visit everyone in the Universe and insult them," a man can dream can't he ?". Don't hate Mr. Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged, every man wants a hobby to keep busy. At last Prefect returns from Africa, and tells the caveman about his bloody adventures there, more importantly of instability in the fabric of Space-Time, as a sofa magically appears and disappears, before their eyes. Ford Prefect says to Dent, for their salvation go after it , running wildly down the hill the two, jump, fall, roll , trying to capture the piece of furniture as it gyrates, fades in and out always moving up and down . At last jumping on the sofa and presto, their back home immediately inside Slartibartfast. Ironically, the old retired planet builder's spaceship (but first landing on a cricket match, in London), only to discover the Planet Krikkit, wants to destroy the whole Universe, again...ouch .They must prevent them somehow but how ? It seems the unfortunate inhabitants of this sad world at the edge of the galaxy, have the worst night sky anywhere. Blackness, no stars or other planets, even moons, they lack ...nothing to see, a complete, gloomy, tedious darkness. A gigantic space cloud precludes any view, not a fun place for stargazing. Which really ticks them off, you can imagine . A previous...war just ten billion years before, had devastated the galaxy, thousands of warships, millions of killer white robots sent by Krikkit before it was stopped, not a very glorious conflict. The sequel could succeed in their deadly mission, such is the universe.... The five "friends" need to get together again, very soon indeed...They require each other's company.
