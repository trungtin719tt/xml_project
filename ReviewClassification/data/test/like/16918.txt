I enjoyed this!I have seen this around the book store a couple times, but didnt really think anything of it. Then one day my mom saw the newest one in the series, and said "Sarah this one look good". Of course I knew that there where three more ahead of that one so I went and picked it up. Glad I did.For me there where 3 twists in this book. The two that happened at once, the third later on. I was pretty shocked actually. I did suspect the vampire thing though. Bianca is likeable, I didn't mind being in her head. Lucas was more interesting to me, he was mysterious like you never knew what was going on in his head. Bianca and Lucas' relationship seemed believable to me and I liked that even though they shouldnt be together because of what they are that wouldn't stop them.As for the secondary characters I liked Balthazar the best. He was kind to Bianca from the beginning and stayed her friend even after she choose Lucas. (not that she was ever going to pick Balthazar). I want to know more about him and his past so I'm quite interested in the book Claudia Grey is writing about him!!
