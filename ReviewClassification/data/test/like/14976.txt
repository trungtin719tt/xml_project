I'm having a hard time kicking this review off, because there is just...so much.I finished this novel last night and have started another, but my head is still full of this story.When I was about 3/4 through the story, an image came to mind. You know when you place a drop of oil on a water surface and then that drop expands out? That's how this story structure seemed to evolve.Beach Music starts off with the main character talking about his wife, who had jumped off a South Carolina bridge to her death. He has started a new life in Rome with his young daughter.As Jack struggles to come to terms with his wife's suicide and recent developments in his life, the past is slowly revealed to us. His Southern past, and his friends and family's past. I thought Pat Conroy's story structure and even his pacing was brilliant.I say "even his pacing" because some of the more negative reviews I've seen have called this novel bloated and tedious. And that can be a fair assessment depending on how you approach it.I picked Beach Music off the to-read list after rejecting a good chunk of suspense novels that have started to dominate my list. At the time, the genre was becoming tiresome to me. The predictability of unreliable narrators, the obligatory twists, my eyes just glazed over them.I was in the mood for just a novel. Just a story with family drama and characters I could care about.I was tired of fast paced plotting. I was tired of racing through yet another hype of the month.Pat Conroy's Prince of Tides was one of my favorite novels ever (Lords of Discipline, not so much), so it was time to give him another shot.I was ready to settle back, and let a story unfold in my head.This story: I felt like I lived it.Pat Conroy was in no rush to tell this story. There are many paths taken and thoughts to consider, so the reader should not be in a rush to have the story (stories) told.My head is full. So many parts to this story will continue to linger with me and in some ways it's a burden...I want to move on and enjoy my next read. But in other ways it's wonderful.I must say that the only negative thing here was how I felt about the second-last chapter or so...the "gathering" was a bit of a reach for me. But this is a very small thing in the grand scheme, and easily forgettable (I had completed this review and forgot to mention it...until just now).It's going to take a while to shake this novel off. Five stars for that. A brilliant read that I would recommend to anyone.
