I am hooked on the Morganville Vampire series! No, no, no... you don't understand... that's not a good thing. Now I'm compelled to run off and invest in the other 6 books that are waiting for me at the bookstore! Very much a predicament when you have so many unread books sitting on your bookshelf, but that's just how good this series is. It's the kind of book that clears a path on your TBR list and shoots straight to the top. I loved it!The characters were engaging and interesting, the writing was bold and refreshing, and the vampire lore was unique and... well... just perfectly paranormal. Great combo in a book from all aspects.About the book: Claire Danvers has just started her freshman year of college, and it's not going so well. She's been targeted by the dorm beeyotch and her minions who have managed to rough her up pretty bad, so she clears out and starts looking for alternative housing and pretty much a safe haven. That's when she comes across Michael, Shane and Eve who reside in the Glass House. When she meets them, Claire is exposed to a whole new world she never believe existed, which consists of vampires, protectors and evil that has plagued Morganville, TX for decades. As she forges more than just a friendship with Michael, Shane and Eve, she quickly comes to realize they must bond together to protect one another from the baddies and the dangers they are faced.What a great kick-off to what I know is an awesome series. I can't wait to jump into the next book and see where the storyline goes. Definitely a book I'd feel comfortable recommending to my fellow avid readers who are fans of paranormal and all that is vampiric and gothic. Put on a little Blue October and grab yourself a bowl of chili a-la-Shane style, and you've got yourself a great little set up. ;)
