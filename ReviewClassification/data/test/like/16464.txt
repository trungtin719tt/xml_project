These books are written terribly but they've actually got pretty developed characters and they basically made me fall in love with reading in third grade or whatever? so. four stars.I actually want to talk aboutwhythese stupid books made me fall in love with reading, because they truly influenced me so much. I think the best thing about this series is the developed character work. This is a series that has defined characters who you can root for or dislike, which is awesome. I actually think the characters improve throughout the series. In series one, Fireclaw is kind of a typical boring do-gooder. Brambleclaw, Leafpool, and Squirrelflight, the main characters in series two, are far more interesting and defined, with clear motivations beyond "do the right thing." This trend continues in series three and four. I also really appreciate the occasional morally grey or morally black characters. Yes, many characters are a bit "I do good things and I'm amazing!!" but characters like Ivypool, in the fourth series, were so influential to my childhood.Yeah, the plot is a little weird and far-fetched, and the writing is pretty terrible now that I've grown up enough to see it, but this series is definitely good for anyone who likes middle grade fiction. Especially kids. This is definitely a series I'd give to all elementary schoolers.
