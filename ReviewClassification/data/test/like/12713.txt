What is with Portland? Oregon brews these freakish, fantastical authors - fascinated with the off color beauty of the grotesque. Not to say that both Palahniuk and Dunn are not genius's, but it's weird man. Weirdly coincidental.So anyway, Geek Love is about this family of carnies (carnival workers - to the less colloquially gifted) that decides to chemically engineer their children. The wife takes arsenic and radioisotopes while pregnant, and the result is a family of freaks. One has fins, one is a hunchback albino dwarf, one is a set of twins attached at the hip. They embark on this Machiavellian sibling rivalry that is wildly entertaining and emotionally gripping.I think Dunn copped out with the ending though - I think she didn't know what to do with the characters, so she just ended it...I hate to give it away, but I thought it was a sloppy ending indeed.That being said, she does overwhelmingly succeed in questioning our society's views on the normal vs freakish. I found myself affected by that worldview as I walked around downtown, feeling all of a sudden very sympathetic towards the less than normal demographic that hangs out west of 3rd.
