Having seen the movie several times I already really knew this story. This book came out when I was only 5 years old and it is crazy that it has taken me this long to pick it up.I enjoyed it for the most part! The book gives a lot more detail character wise than the movie which was nice on occasion, but I thought the movie did a good job editing the characters especially Willy Jack; there was some unneeded scenes with him.Having said that this story is filled with great side characters. Moses and Certain are a favorite along with quirky Sister Husband. The story as a whole is engaging and heart warming. It also doesn't shy away from consequences of life choices.
