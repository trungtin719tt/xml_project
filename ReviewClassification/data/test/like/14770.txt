I feel funny now. No, this novel wasn't a how-to-be-a-comedian manual under the guise of some kind of fucked up, deranged horror. I feel FUNNY funny, strange funny, like someone touched me inappropriately and I don't know how I feel funny. Halfway through the book, I put it down and eyeballed my partner and started throwing existential crisis theories at him. I have this problem with depersonalization and derealization where in heightened states of anxiety you detach from your reality or your sense of self. Mostly it's triggered by standing in shopping centres and being overwhelmed with rage, disgust, fear and hunger but sometimes it's triggered by someone fucking with my head. As Bret Easton Ellis did with me with Lunar Park. Is this real, what is real, that's not real, is he in a psychotic meltdown, oh fuck, what's going on, somebody GET MY DAUGHTER'S FURBY OUT OF THE FUCKING HOUSENo, just joking, I have more taste than to buy my daughter a furby let alone fill it with my haunted past so that it turns into a soul sucking demon bird crazed, fuck what is going on here. Alternating fear, discomfort and amusement. I didn't know how I felt. My confusedness is showing in my review. Okay, if you're a parent, one of your kids probably has a toy that creeps you the fuck out. You can't get rid of it because that would just be reinforcing the fact that a)you are insane and b)gutless. My daughter has this troll in a pink princess dress that creeps out anyone who touches it. My sister in law visited recently and she picked it up thinking it was some type of obese barbie doll but upon flipping it over, she was faced with the horrors of all horrors and she promptly dropped it. This doll definitely does things to me in my sleep, it probably watches me shower, swims in my urine when I forget to flush the toilet, is that little tickle on my foot at night that I imagine is the cat WHEN I KNOW IT REALLY ISN'T.You may have thought I went off on a tangent there. You were right but a problem shared is a problem halved and now I feel better.
