"Flectere si nequeo superos, Acheronta movebo!"If I cannot sway the heavens, I will wake the powers of hell"(Before I actually start reviewingThe Aeneid, I'd like to thank Mr. Bernard Knox not only for his very helpful introductions in the Penguin Deluxe Editions of the three big classic epics, but for sharing his heartfelt story as an U.S. Army captain and his encounter with theSortes VirgilianaeofThe Aeneidin the last weeks of World War II in Italy.)Imperator Caesar Divi FiliusThe Aeneid, written by the Italian poet Virgil in the 1st century BC, is the first, and perhaps the only, truly successful fan fiction ever written. It follows the story of Aeneas, a Dardanian prince, offspring of Anchises and the goddess Aphrodite/Venus, and his wanderings to find Italy and plant the seeds that would one day spring into the greatest empire of the ancient world. He carries his father and son out of the burning wreckage of Troy, and tries to find a new home for the homeless surviving sons of Troy.This book has one of the most interesting and luckiest stories a book can have. In one thing Virgil was brilliant at, and that was at feeling the temperature of the crowd.The Roman Republic has fallen, Gaius Julius Caesar has seen to that. His adopted son, Octavian, has just secured what many think will be a dynasty that will rule the world. What better time to sing of the legitimacy of Roman supremacy?On them I set no limits, space or timeI have granted them power, empire without end.- Jupiter on Aeneas' sons.Most rulers, in particular in earlier History, have had to deal with the awful task of legitimacy. Kings and emperors rule not because of force (well, it is definitely because of force, but that's not what we want the people to think), but because it is their divine right. When one power falls and another rises, was it due to the will of the gods or to the greed of man against the gods' champion? (For more on this question, readRichard II).As such, a new rule, a new dynasty, will always have to justify if and how their rule is divine will and not an abomination against the gods. What better time for Augustus, the head of the Gens Julia, to recall his adopted father's claim on divinity? He has added"Divi Filius"to his name, "son of a god", because Julius Caesar had already been deified, and both men claim descent from Aeneas, and therefore from Venus.Virgil not only sings of Aeneas and Venus in order to greaten their descendant, Augustus, he sings directly of Augustus as if the entirety of the Trojan escapades had been simply to put him on Earth. I can see the young emperor puffing up at every mention of how the gods want the Trojan/Italian hybrid race to rule the world, and that Vulcan himself carved the Battle of Actium into Aeneas' shield, the son of a goddess carrying his descendant's most glorious victory. Truly wonderful propaganda.Here is Caesar and all the line of Iulussoon to venture under the sky's great arch.Here is the man, he's here! Time and againyou've heard his coming promised - Caesar Augustus!Son of a god, he will bring back the Age of Gold (...)expand his empire past the Garamants and the Indiansto a land beyond the stars, beyond the wheel of the year,the course of the sun itself (...)"- Anchises' ghost to Aeneas, as they see Caesar Augustus in the UnderworldHomer's Successor, Paris' SuccessorI get it, Virgil, I really do.The Iliad's epic battles are adrenaline injections to the reader, and Odysseus' misadventures in theThe Odysseyhave that Classical tragedy "everything going down hill" charisma to them. Trying to do both at the same time is daring, and you did a wonderful job, except you tried to do so much it feels too little.The battles between the Italians and the Trojan exiles sound *vaguely* like the Trojan War, only in a smaller, slightly less exciting scale. Aeneas' attempts to focus on his destiny and destination, his shaking off the lusts and perils thrown at him along the way... it felt like an Odysseus searching for a Penelope he never knew, a destiny that he carries because hehasto, not one driven by his own free will and determination.Dido is Aeneas' Circe and Calypso, diluted down to a mortal spurned woman. She is by far the character I felt the most for: she is a widow, robbed of her love and her homeland, trying to rebuild her life in Carthage, and then some guy shows up yelling "look at me,Isaw Polyphemus, my mother is a goddess,Iam a Trojan hero, did I mention my mother is Venus, the goddess of beauty - by the way, I don't take after my father!"Dido has her memory of her former husband wiped out by Venus (I don't really the profit for her party, but okay) and is compelled to end up with Aeneas in some cave shagging, which to some constitutes marriage, but not to the State of Carthage.Dido's tragic end is entirely Venus and Aeneas' fault, who took to a grieving widow knowing that his destiny was elsewhere, and then is surprised to find her in Hades after her attention-seeking suicide - a curse and a prophecy of the coming of Hannibal, Rome's scourge."And you, my Tyrians,harry with hatred all his line, his race to come (...)No love between our peoples, ever, no pacts of peace!Come rising up from my bones, you avenger still unknown"Of Gods and Men: Part IIIIf you read my reviews of The Iliad and The Odyssey, you may have seen me obsessively analysing the God/Man relationships in Homer's epics, because it is the facet of his work I find the most fascinating.Virgil's gods are a bit too complacent. Homer's Hera and Virgil's Juno are the best kept persona, her intensity and obsession are all still there, but the rest of the gods just can't be bothered. Venus is always saving her son, as she does against Diomedes in The Iliad, but only halfway through the book does she remember "oh maybe I should have helped your Trojans during the fall of Troy instead of making you run away like a coward".Jupiter doesn't do a single relevant thing in the entire book except saying "no more meddling", which is thoroughly disobeyed by both parties. Vulcan's role is to do theexact same thinghe did in The Iliad as Hephaestus - to forge a shield for the protagonist.It felt like the conflict of the gods among themselves, to be expected in basically any decision they ever make, polytheistic gods being unilateral by definition, was lacking. Artemis/Diana, supporter of Troy during the war, simply switches sides to the warrior princess Camilla; Ares/Mars just can't be bothered; Athena is either asleep or too busy trying to bring Odysseus a GPS on some goddamn world's end.The entire conflict of the forces of nature we see in The Iliad seems diluted in the wars in Italy...The King and the UsurperI feel like I've been focusing on the negatives ofThe Aeneid, and I want to make clear that I loved this book. Those four stars up there are actually a 4.5, which is not only a 5 because I, in my own aspirations for this epic, I found some of them lacking. This does not mean it isn't one of the most powerful pieces of literature that have survived from ancient times, and a recommended read. It felt more lyrical than Homer, and it had some truly great writing (Fagles' translation is as great as ever).The entirety of this work is set and bound in finding Aeneas in Italy, to claim a new home for his Trojans, to build a second Troy, to honour the memory of the fallen in the East.The best part of this epic is Aeneas' moral ambiguity. He's like a second Odysseus or Achilles, in that his actions are driven by his knowledge of his fate - which is repeated a little too often throughout the book - and since he is guided by the gods and the will of the universe, he does not have to think about the other side to his actions.He has to conquer Hesperia. He has to found Troy II. He is duty bound to fight the Italians - which, in all fairness, he avoids at all costs - because the gods say so.But the truth is that Aeneas and his Trojans are invaders. They arrive in peace, and they try to form ties of friendship with the natives, but they still have as a plan to settle as an independent city, a city commanded by the heavens to conquer, plunder and force its culture down the world's throat. Alba Longa, and its great daughter, Rome, might have been built in peace, but in their national consciousness the command was always war.In this view, Aeneas is the rightful ruler of Latium, and his descendants the rightful rulers of all. But from a Latin point of view, Aeneas is a refugee that has arrived on their land, somehow contrived to get the hand of a princess and a kingdom, a city that - unbeknownst to them - has war in its mind.Turnus, the antagonist, is nothing more than a man spurned by a king, robbed of his bride by a foreigner, and he tries to fight for what he believes is just. To the very last, when his sister Juturna fakes a signal from Jupiter to inspire the Italians to think they will win, Turnus believes he is on the side of justice. He calls himself"a second Achilles", and the entire war for a woman is very Homeric - Lavinia is the new Helen, Aeneas is his brother-in-law Paris, and Turnus is more Menelaus than Achilles.So what we see, really, is a miniature Trojan War. And like the genuine deal, we can be rooting for one side or another: we can sing of just Achaeans and spurred Menelaus, Turnus and his attempts at defending his rights and the freedom of his people - or we can root for fallen Troy and the romance of Paris and Helen, for Aeneas' destined love and rule of Italy. Personally, I couldn't relate to Aeneas' cause as much as I'd like, even though Virgil throws in a forced "the people ache for Aeneas" justification for his conquering.In Carthage, Aeneas didn't need to war. He could rule besides Dido, and from her bones, instead of the horrible wars between her city and his, would rise an empire as powerful as Rome. Yet he is too stuck in the past, in the future he sees only the past reflected, a second Troy, a second War.If the Fates had left me free to live my life,to arrange my own affairs of my own free will,Troy is the city, first of all, that I'd safeguard,Troy and all that's left of my people whom I cherish.- Aeneas to Dido.But Fate, a tale three deities wrote, history that not even the gods are willing to confront or try to change, has decided blood and iron would build this empire, blood and iron would rule it. Gods are not gods if they themselves are ruled, and men are not men if they cannot try and build their own fate, like Turnus did.do the gods light this fire in our hearts, or does each man's mad desire become his god?- NisusThe justice and law of the Roman Empire, that vicious civilisation, which by force brought great advancements to the Mediterranean world, has never been more accurately depicted than in Aeneas' actions:veni, "vidi", vici
