Third Read November 2015: 4 starsSecond Read November 2014: 5 starsFirst Read September 2014: 5 starsNew thoughts on the third read: I give the first 11% of this booka million stars!The ending is fantastic! The middle? Ehhhhhhh. I struggled with it. It was boring and all about the drama with the sidhe-seers, and I just don't care about them. It's important for the world-building, and I understand it, but it's my third time reading it, and it didn't interest me much. So I am deducting a star. But man, the beginning? *drool* Still SO FREAKING HOT! Still my favorite series.Our first annual re-read of the Fever series with theMacHalo groupstarts October 26, 2015! Here's the schedule (sorry, I can't keep to a schedule with this series - it takes over and I have to devour it once I start):Darkfever: October 26 / Bloodfever: November 9 / Faefever: November 23 / Dreamfever: December 7 / Shadowfever: December 21 / Iced: January 5 / Burned: January 12New thoughts on the second read:This is pretty much the sidhe-seers book. After we get past the delicious beginning of the book(view spoiler)[ HOW DARE YOU LEAVE THAT ROOM MAC?!?!?(hide spoiler)], the whole middle is pretty much about Mac getting to know Dani, Kat, and trying to figure out how to outwit Rowena. It's about her trying to find a way to get the abbey girls to trust her and work with her. I didn't find this as interesting as the first time, but it's still a vital part of the story, and I totally understand why most the book was spent on this. A lot of important information came out about the past, we got more V'lane, Ryodan, and a little of Mac's parents thrown in. My thing is just thatall I want to read about is BARRONS, so, yeah, well... he's not in this one enough. Hmmph.The ending was just as crazy-good as the first time. Incredible cliffhanger ending that you just can't read fast enough. Still one of the best urban fantasy series EVAH!Original review:Now that cliffhanger was just a really mean thing to do. BUT OMG I LOVED THIS BOOK.LOVED. LOVED. LOVED.The section with Dani's POV was a little different, especially seeing as how we only heard from her POV one time, in the beginning of the book. She's an interesting character, so it's all good. I am sure there will be more to come from her, that much is obvious.Barrons was epic. In the beginning with Mac... I can't even. I need more answers, though. I want more of him. MORE. I totally understand why Mac would pull away from him and it'd be awkward - after, ahem, everything they did.So much happened and there is still a lot to wrap up. Mac is really shaping up to be quite the badass. What a great heroine. I'm in my happy place with this one. Ok, off to start book 5. Well, maybe I'll do a quick re-read of Mac and Barrons in the beginning first. ;)BARRONS.
