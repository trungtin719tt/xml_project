I was surprised at how much I liked this book... it's been a long time (we're talking over a decade) since I've read a Tom Robbins book and my expectations weren't terribly high for this one.I knew absolutely nothing about the story when I began reading, so it was a pleasant surprise to find that it was the type of story I usually enjoy. It includes a "skilled underdog" story (a young female perfumer), and an immortality story, which is often pretty fascinating, and includes kings, alternate dimensions, and all sorts of craziness, but presented in such a way that it isn't as, well, kooky, as some of Robbins work can be.Robbins is clearly a man who knows how to weave his wordage, which I usually appreciate, although in my opinion sometimes he delves a little too deeply into theorizing/explaining mode (especially noticeable towards then end when the story is wrapping up).Overall a pretty good book- fun, smart, and sweet.Memorability Factor 8/10
