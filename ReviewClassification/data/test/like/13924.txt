Oh, if there were only the words to express how I feel about Frost. There aren't the right words nor near enough. However, I do enjoy reading his poems. They buoy me.I am usually a lover of short poems, yet, even in his longer poems a line or two will reverberate.Most will recommend "Stopping By Woods on a Snowy Evening", "The Road Not Taken" or "Nothing Gold Can Stay". There are reasons why they would recommend these poems, as they have merit. Yet, these are not the only poems worth their keep. I recommend reading "Reluctance", "Into My Own", "Tree At My Window", "Wild Grapes" and "Devotion".I may yet live, as I know others live,To wish in vain to let go with the mind -Of cares, at night, to sleep; but nothing tells meThat I need learn to let go with the heart.from "Wild Grapes"
