I was a little concerned before starting this one, since after reading the third book in the series it looked like Jeaniene Frost was heading down the Urban Fantasy/minimal romance path, but turns out my worries were unfounded--the romance is back! Although it's a sometimes rocky road that Cat and Bones must follow, with lots of obstacles that test their love, and jealousies and insecurities they have to deal with, they clearly have an enduring love that I feel will stand the test of time. And while the love scenes aren't many, they're smokin' hot and quite emotional--loved them!As for the plot, Cat no longer works for her uncle as a government agent ridding the country of rogue vampires and ghouls. She and her vamp lover Bones are taking a well deserved vacation when Cat is bothered by some terrifying dreams. She has dreams of a seductive vampire named Gregor who claims she's his. Gregor is a 'dreamsnatcher'--capable of invading her dreams, and wants her to return to him. It seems Cat spent a month with Gregor in Paris when she was sixteen, and something happened during that time that makes Gregor believe that Cat belongs to him. Of course Cat doesn't rememberanyof this (thanks to Master vamp Mencheres, who wiped her memory clean and then imprisoned Gregor). But Gregor has broken out of his prison, and wants Cat back. But why? Because he truly loves her or for some other reason? And why did Mencheres butt in? Bones is furious that someone would dare to take his "Kitten" from him, and wants Cat to avoid Gregor as he figures out a way to deal with the powerful vamp. But headstrong, impulsive Cat likes to confront her problems head-on, so you just know her curiosity will get the better of her...This leads to all kinds of problems in her relationship with Bones. Just like a regularhumancouple, they go through some tough times dealing with a person determined to break them apart, and have to fight their feelings of jealousy and insecurity, deal with supposed betrayals, and wounded pride. Will their love be strong enough to endure this test, or will it crumble under the pressure?I enjoyed this plotline. Things areneversmooth sailing for Cat and Bones, but it's usually because someone is trying to kill one or the other, and you get to see Cat and Bones at their kicka** best, fighting the baddies. And while there is some of that kind of action in this book (especially at the explosive end), Cat doesn't do a whole lot of fighting in this one. Mostly its about the problems in their relationship, and if they will be able to work them out. Most of the characters from the previous books return, some with large roles (Spade, Vlad), others with token appearances or mentions (Cooper, Tate, Juan, Don, Denise, Annette, Justina, Rodney), and a couple of interesting new characters (the ghostly Fabian, and voodoo queeen/ghoul Majestic) are introduced. Cat's friendship with Vlad deepens, and she finally comes to a decision about whether she's ready to become a full-time vamp or not. After she makes that decision, there's a scene that reminded me a lot of Bella and Z (and her 'needing') from JR Ward'sLover Awakened--hawt!Of course it wouldn't be a 'Night Huntress' book without the trademark quips, rude sayings, and laugh out loud dialogue between some of the characters. Cat gets off a couple of good R-rated zingers, one of which showcases her jealousies to one of Bones's French female admirers:"He f**** even better than he looks. And that beautiful face is going to be clamped between my legs as soon as we get "oome', don't you worry."And another, referring to Bones:"Bones has always been smart. His intelligence was just camouflaged under a mountain of p****."Spade gets off a few of his own too. Speaking to Cat:"The last time you ran off like Henny Penny to shout the sky down, it didn't turn out well, did it?"And after catching her with Vlad:"Lucifer's bloody balls, is that why you haven't returned my calls?"And finally, Bones, to Gregor, after Cat mouths off to him:"Don't care for her tongue, do you? How strange. I find it one of my favorite parts."So, lots of what you come to expect from the 'Night Huntress' series: some fighting, some lovin', some great dialogue, some great vampire tricks, some intrique--all leading up to a big ol' explosive conclusion right out of an action movie! And while things look like they're settled for now (with the bad guys taken care of), somehow you know that they're...not. I think there's a lot more in store for my favorite vampire couple, and I for one can't wait! 4 1/2 stars
