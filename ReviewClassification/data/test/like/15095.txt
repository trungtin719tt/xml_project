I picked up this book based on recommendations from friends. I already loved Jodi Picoult from My Sister's Keeper, The Tenth Circle, and Nineteen Minutes. Yet again, she did not disappoint.I don't know what to say about the book without sounding hokey...it is a great story about teen love and commitment.I am always amazed at how deeply I feel I know Jodi's characters. Right now Chris is sticking in my mind and how often I just wanted to shake him and say "Tell someone! Don't be a hero!" But, isn't that exactly what being a teenager was like? Thinking you could handle anything that came your way on your own? The adults would just screw things up if they knew what was going on, right? And the same for Emily "Just talk to someone, you'll feel better". I felt just as helpless reading the book as I did being a teenager. I want to scream to all the teenagers - "WE REALLY DO GET IT!! WE'RE NOT AS STUPID AS WE LOOK!!"
