This book was voted one of the top ten life-changing books by readers of Parade Magazine. Each time I read it I understand something new and find something profound and relevant to my life. If you understand the context of how the book was translated and appreciate the fact that an uneducated teenager could never have "written" it (especially in about 90 days) you cannot deny that it is another true testament of Jesus Christ.
