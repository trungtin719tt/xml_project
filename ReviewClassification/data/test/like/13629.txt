I think everyone will take something away from this book! This book will give you incite into your own feelings and offer encouragement on the healing process. No matter what the feelings are - Grief, sadness, fear, loss of control, helplessness, discouraged, there are writings in here for everything you may go through. Her writings have a nice easy way of talking you through offering you encouragement to go on.I have a new job and it is much more stress than my old job and at times has been discouraging. There are some of these that I would love to print out and hang on my office walls!Like this one I really like -Everyone's got a dream. And no two dreams are exactly the same.There's a divine reason for this. You were created for a purpose.Instead of forcing this to happen, allow the Spirit to fill youwith the understanding of what it is.This will change your life.And this one (of course, being a Christian, for me it is God) -Even during the times you feel the most alone,there is always a presence watching you,hearing your internal dialogue.Don't be afraid. Don't feel alone.Let the lead you.Also a real nice touch is the pictures with the sayings on them that can easily be used as posters!A beautiful oversize book with wonderful, touching poems and sayings and pictures!I voluntarily posted this review after receiving a copy of this book from "Poetic Book Tours" and the author - Thank You!
