McCullough has us believe, for 466 pages, that Adams is generally disliked among the political set of his time and that there is no way he could be elected President: he is anti-slavery, deeply spiritual, a fine family man who loved first his wife, then his children, then farming, and he was always dedicated to doing the right thing (he even defended the British at one point and won the trial: it was the right thing, but not the popular thing to do). But suddenly, on page 467, in what feels like a plot twist, John Adams is inaugurated as America's 2nd President! Then, within a few pages, he is being trashed and slandered again. What does he do? He shuts down the slanderous publication and jails the publisher and a few writers in what feels like a violation of the 1st Amendment. (This would be like Obama shutting down Fox News after having enough of those ridiculous "birther" stories.) This book feels, and is, massive but stupendously readable. And McCullough doesn't err in the way of some historical writers and include all of his research notes: he sticks to the good stuff and delivers a page-turner. What I don't know about my own country's Founding Fathers is shameful: it's time to read more about these remarkable people. As the author says on the back cover, "With change accelerating all around, more and more we need understanding an appreciation of those principles upon which the republic was founded...What was the source of their courage...Who were those people...I don't think we can ever know enough about them." No, but we can make an effort to better understand them!
