When you don't have any family to turn to and you think your in this world by yourself you still have to keep strength to keep moving on.This woman is treated so badly by her husband that is a detective, so why would anyone give her the time of day and belive her story? The big house, nice clothes, shoes, that should be all we need right? She makes a brake for it but her husband is really good at his job. Little does she know there is another good kind, caring detective out there that can read all the signs. There are children envolved that makes her get a little relaxed and distracted (comfort is a wonderful sense of calm). This is when the strength and unknown power pours out of her. Never under estimate the power of little women. It was a page turner of action and suspence and love all in one.
