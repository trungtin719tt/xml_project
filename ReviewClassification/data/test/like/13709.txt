Richard Bach is the author of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, a book about birds, but teaches lessons relevant to humans. I liked that book, but I like his second book MORE. It is about PEOPLE learning life lessons, not birds. I guess I relate more to people!!Illusions is a lighthearted mystical adventure story about two barnstorming vagabonds who meet in the fields of the Midwest. Richard Bach meets Don Shimoda, the Reluctant Messiah. Magic and miracles surround Don. He calls them Illusions, not Miracles. Richard wants to learn. Don presents him with Messiah's Handbook: Reminders for the Advanced Soul. It starts 'Perspective, Use It or Lose It. If you turned to this page, you're forgetting that what is going on around you is not reality'. Richard reads more and more and Don speaks more and more. Very beautiful life-clarifying phrases.I see this book as a wonderful book to read AND DISCUSS with a friend.If any of you want to read this book, let me know if you would like to discuss it with ME.5 stars
