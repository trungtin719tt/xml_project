The dude who checks books out to me at my library gave an arched eyebrow and a curled lip at me when I checked this masterpiece out. I promptly flipped the book over with a satisfying*whomp*and pointed out: "Uh, it's put out byGrove Press, ever heard ofthem?!"Sheesh, the philistines I have to deal with daily! Just makes ya need somethin' to relax with: say, a handful of benzodiazepines, a mug of ice cream and The Captain, the latest issue ofThe Baffler, and some Esquivel on the Hi-Fi.Ahh, that's better.Life is too short to worry about people who fail to recognize the massive importance of this literary touchstone. Hey, ya gonna pass me that? It ain't incense!
