This is one of the finest books I've ever read! I have jokingly said, "I recommend this book to anyone who likes anything." While that's a bit of an exaggeration, this book really has it all:The story manages to be both compelling and a parody at the same time. The main characters-Onegin, Lensky, Tatiana and Olga- are all believable and likeable, but that doesn't stop the narrator from poking fun at them occasionally. But Pushkin's parody is sympathetic; You laugh at the characters the way you laugh at the foibles of your favorite aunts and uncles, still caring for them even while you acknowledge the fact that people can be ridiculous.But my favorite character is Pushkin himself. He intrudes into the novel (sometimes as a character, sometimes as the novel's creator) with numerous digressions ranging from poignant personal asides to witty commentaries and playful parody. Along with the story of Onegin and Tatiana, the novel tells us the story of an artist's quest to create a thing of beauty.Since the book is a "novel in verse," the story is told in beautiful poetry. I personally rank the original, Russian text with the finest long poems I have ever read, including Paradise Lost, The Divine Comedy and King Lear because of the beauty and elegance of its use of language and structure. (That being said, I don't have the skills to read Dante in Italian.) And of all the translations I have observed, James Falen's translation does the best job of capturing Pushkin's lyrical grace. Nabokov's translation is more literal, but painfully so. He manages to translate Pushkin's words without translating Pushkin himself. Granted, I do recommend the Nabokov translation to Anglo-American students of Russian language and literature who want to come closer to the language of Pushkin, because I have found Nabokov's translation to be a great literary mediator. But in terms of a translation that works as a piece of literature on its own, I recommend Falen's translation. It might not be the same as the original, but you do comprehend Pushkin's prowess and poise, and many of Falen's rhymes sparkle just as well as Pushkin's.
