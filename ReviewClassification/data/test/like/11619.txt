It still astounds me how a decades old horror story can continue to captivate and terrify a modern-day audience, more attuned to altogether grislier, bloodier, and gorier tales.The Haunting of Hill House is about exactly as the title described. And yet knowing all that is to come enhances instead of detracts from the building dread that begins right as the novel opens. The reader is introduced to a motley crew of intrepid explorers, advancing on the hidden Hill House as part of a spiritual experiment, and the terrors unfurl from there.The reader is invited to view this world through Eleanor's eyes. As the most fragile and overwrought member of the group, her rising fear affects the reader's, until both are bonded in their mounting dread of what is to occur around the next corner and over the next page. Jackson expertly controls her characters into revealing none of the facts before suspense has been allowed to build to an all-time maximum, and that is truly where the excellence of this novel lays.My first encounter with Jackson's writing was in her short story collection,Dark Tales. I found the open-ended nature of the tales contained within entirely infuriating. Here, a similar tactic is deployed and yet I found it be ultimately the novel's prowess and not its failure. There is an allure and an added fear of never really knowing where the truth in this narratives lies. This is what has continued to haunt me long after finishing this book and what makes me already eager to return and unearth the facts amongst the many deceptions.Hill House, with its chill, atmospheric setting, enthralled me from the first page and didn't let go until the very last. The setting works in tandem with the alluring yet untrustworthy cast of characters to delivering a truly chilling piece of literature that will have you fearful of the shadows for many a night to come, after reading this.
