This book is my second book by Selznick and it follows the character of Hugo Cabret, a young orphan who is in hiding. Hugo lives at the station and he is in charge of the clocks all over the station. He hides away from everyone as he is basically alone and abandoned and he's doing his drunk uncle's job.Of course, soon Hugo's life of thievery and clockwork is challenged when he is caught thieving. He has quite a few secrets he wants to keep but he soon realises that this is not going to be easy to do.The story is told half in text and half in images. The images are a stunning pencil style with some truly fantastic cropping and framing making them feel dynamic and essential to the plot. I have to say I love the style.This is my second favourite of the two Selznick books I have so far read, but I know Selznick is fast becoming an auto-buy author for me as his stories and pictures just work so well. I loved the focus of the story and the way it unfolded, just so much adventure and mystery. 4.5*s overall.
