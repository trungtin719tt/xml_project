I am the same age as this book. So I thought it was time to read it. My husband wasn't to sure about me reading it but I loved it. wish I had read it sooner.The book starts in september 1945 with Anne moving from her home town to New York. She gets a job very quickly and because of her looks a man. However she is very independent and dosn't want to be married and tied down. Anne is lovely and gentle and kind and through out the whole book that dosn't change.Neely is young and crazy with a lovely singing voice. She soon latches on to Anne and her kindness. Neely starts off ok as a character but as she gets the things she wants in life she becomes quite demanding and very selfish.Jennifer is a bomb, The body every man wants to hold against him and every woman wants and it's her body that gets doors open. There is nothing mean about Jennifer, unlike Anne she does want to settle down and have a family.It's easy to get attached to these girls. Anne is the stable one through out the book the other two struggle and their back grounds hold them back a bit esp Jennifer. You are with them every step of the way with their joys and heartaches.This story is well written and I can see why it was so popular. It does talk about sex but it isn't a r18 story. It just shows the dangers of presure and stress and in this story about the down falls of being a star. Loved this story
