4.5I loved this book! I don't think I liked it as much as Cinder but I still really enjoyed it. I just love being in this world.Things I loved:-Scarlet/Wolf &lt;3-Cinder and Thorne's friendship-Iko being a ship-Captain Thorne.I read the majority of the book in one night, I was so addicted to it. I'm very excited to move onto Cress now as it seems to be most peoples favorite.
