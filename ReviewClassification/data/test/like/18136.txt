In the world of pseudoscience, the subject of time travel is always entertaining , fascinating and downright shall we say, fun...Imagine going back to any year, in the distant, obscure past, (reachable now )...taking a peek, looking around the corner , at the mysteries, seeing actual situations and judging for yourself . What was real, not myths, legends or fabrications ( a polite word for lies), meeting important, famous people in history books, places that are long gone or in ruins now, yet still captures our interest. Michael Crichton has written one of the best in this genre ...The characters journey is continuously moving forward, from one danger to another, Professor Johnston's little band of rather frightened but intrepid archaeologists, won't surrender without a fight, their quest for knowledge, (in fact a rescue mission) inevitably turns into a sick nightmare. This is not a dull dig , they're used to, trying to discover an ancient artifact or an old stone wall, but a new experience which may kill you...It's quite different seeing old bones walking now, and breathing ... Maybe some they originally found, themselves... the corporation ITC, that funded this and the mad billionaire genius that controls it , Robert Doniger, wants to make a good profit, (business is business) naturally, the rebuilt medieval sites will make nice tourist attractions , as the money pours in. The dreams of a rich young, very ambitious man getting richer...paradise... for the fortunate few.The expenses have been tremendous, still after all , they, the "volunteers" are a fish out of water nevertheless, no matter how clever these modern travelers appear. The camouflages and technologies enable them to blend in, these aliens try to survive the strange land, of the medieval era.. The cruel customs, bloodthirsty knights, their swords hacking to pieces anyone they like... and enjoying it, peasants oppressed , sieges, secret passages in castles, endless conflicts, cut- throat bandits hiding in the deep forest ready to slaughter, any who foolishly go there, the superstitious people fight back when possible... The time is 1357, the One Hundred Years War is devastating France , the English invaders will not leave and the Black Death has felled a third of the population in Eurupe...20 million that in a few hours stumbled into the emptiness . ..A trip that the adventurous will appreciate, even love, the closest anyone will get to the Dark Ages which scientists today have refuted. There was a lot more intellectual stirrings then, and the brillance though a small minority , showed through, for the brighter future ...whenever that will occur....
