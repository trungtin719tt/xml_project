No one understands the high stakes associated with making a book recommendation like a serious reader, especially when it's to a good friend, co-worker, or family member. Books that we love say a lot about our personalities, things that we're passionate about, and even shed light on our past experiences (good and bad). That's a lot to share with someone! Along with that pressure is the fear of introducing the wrong book to the wrong reader, or getting the timing wrong. What if they absolutely hate it?! Where does that leave us?The flip side is equally scary. When someone you esteem recommends a book that they hold dear, and upon reading it, you find that youhatedit, that can make things a little awkward. "How'd you like that book I loaned you?" might just be the subject of your recurring nightmare. I've sometimes found myself wondering, "Why on earth would this person think this book would speak tome? Obviously we're not as close as I thought we were."I exaggerate, but no one understands these common reading kerfuffles like readers do! It's why I struggle to keep silent when I see someone bypassing a book I thought was brilliant (and on sale, no less) at a bookstore. I want to run after them and say, "Put that corny romance novel back and takethis. It changed my life!" It's also why I try to avoid talking to strangers in bookstores who want to unload all their favorites on me without knowing a thing about me. On several occasions, I've dutifully waited until said person cleared out of the store before returning Jimmy Buffet's latest book to its shelf, along with the copy of Zane's current bestseller. I'm not knocking them, I just know what I like...and it's not that!This summer when I was shopping for books at a local thrift store, a woman shovedStill Aliceinto my overflowing shopping cart. I was a bit annoyed. She didn't know me! All she kept saying was that if I hadn't read it, I needed to. Apparently, it had changed her life. There in that aisle, a complete stranger started talking to me about caring for her mother who had Alzheimer's, and how this book turned the tables by giving the reader the perspective of the victim of the disease. Before I knew it, I was sharing my story about my grandmother, and her current battle with ALS, an equally progressive degenerative disease with no cure.Talk about books bringing people together! Though I didn't get her name, I left the store with this book based solely on that woman's recommendation...and I absolutely loved it! I wish I could tell her how right she was. This book hit a raw nerve, and really took me out of the caregiver role in order to focus on the real heroes battling neurological disorders every day. What must it be like to wish for a "logical" disease that one could fight with medication or radiation? One particular question that Alice, the protagonist, asks really struck me to the core:"Is the part of my brain that's responsible for my unique 'me-ness' vulnerable to this disease? Or is my identity something that transcends neurons, proteins, and defective molecules of DNA? Is my soul and spirit immune to the ravages of Alzheimer's?"I'm going to be as equally pushy as my nameless thrift store friend.Read this book!Don't make me chase after you, because I wear my running shoes to the bookstore nowadays. That is all.
