WHAAAAAAAAAAAAAT? If I didn't have book #5 I would be FURIOUS. She can't leave us hanging like THAT!! Mean, mean woman!Oh my god. This book ends on a Huge cliffhanger so beware! In this 4th instalment, all hell has broken loose and Mac has been through worse than hell. Or maybe not? I'm not sure. It didn't seem so bad, right? (haha). The novel starts strong and keeps going with tons of energy. But, not surprisingly, the questions are still piling up. We got a teasing glance in Barrons past, but other than that, book 5 has to be packed full of answers - or I may harm somebody.The characters have changed in big ways, in this book especially, and I love how Moning has voiced them. It's not enough to tell us that Mac is different, she took her character andshowedus. It was amazing to be in her head while she was being "cured" and see the raw animalism that makes a person pra-ya. It makes us understand the fae world that she has built. It was very cool! World building is definitely not overlooked in this series. One of the best I've ever read.Dani was also much more present in this one and actually had a few chapters in her POV. Dani is 13 years old, and you could tell! Moning wrote her nonchalance and teenage behaviour wonderfully. It served well to differentiate the characters and mindsets. I've read lots of books where there are multiple POVs but they all sort of blend in together. So props to good writing.At this point in the game there is nothing much else to say. This series is definitely a drug. I LOVE the anticipation and mystery regardless of how much it pisses me off. :)Book 5, starting now!
