Such a lovely story about four 15 year old girls who have been friends since they were babies and their mums met at a 'mums and bubs' yoga class. They have spent every summer together... until now.As a way to try and remain connected, they decide that they will send each other a pair of jeans (magical as they fit all of them perfectly) in rotation through the summer along with a letter recounting what adventures they have had with the pants.It sounds a bit twee, but it is actually quite a fun easy read about friendship and family. It was refreshing to read a book about girls of this age that isn't all "mean girls", but is more about genuine loving friendships.I'm not in a rush to finish the series, but I may pick up book 2 someday. I think this is a fine story on its own.
