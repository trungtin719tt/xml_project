You can find any number of books about men matching their wits against nature. Sailing, climbing, hiking, running, whatever. I can't think of any book where a woman matches her wits against nature. And certainly not a normal American soap opera watching, pill popping, aging housewife kind of woman. It's a simple tale and it isn't. To outline it is to spoil the absolute delight in following this woman out beyond the "trash line" (her great description of approaching human settlements) as she tries to die, and then, of course tries not to die. Along the way, she does not do as most men trying to survive do which is discover or rediscover what we've lost - our connection to nature. And in a man's case, our attempt to dominate it. This woman discovers nature, true, but she really discovers herself. Or perhaps she reinvents herself. This is a total page turner. I went to bed reading it. And then I kept reading it straight through the night. Big Thumbs Up.
