I am not in love with Carlos Fuentes. I do not want him. I don't think about him all the time--Just kidding.Even though I do feel the same way about Carlos, I'm not going to mention it. I'm going totryto control myself this time.TRY.Miss Simone Elkeles is officially one of my favorite authors now. I love her damn work! I love her characters. I want to meet her so badly. That woman knows what she's talking about. I finished this whole book in one day. All 324 pages of it. I eat it all up, and thoroughly enjoyed it. Why are her books so damn good!? I'll tell you why. Sit down, folks. Sit down.1.I don't care how cliche her stories are. I don't care how one can predict what can happen. I don't care. Her characters are too damn developed for that. They're too damn funny, thoughtful, emotional, and complex for that. It can be as cliche as Elkeles wishes, she's still good at voice and character development. I forgot all the things about love stories that annoy me the most. I was too distracted by her awesome writing and characters.2.Even thoughRules of Attractionis super unrealistic, it was truly adorable. Yeah, yeah. Bad boy falls in love with good girl, we've seen that plenty of times. Then why I'm I LOVING THIS SO MUCH?! Because Elkeles wrote this with such beauty and emotion. I love Carlos so much. Yes, he's a jerk and super annoying, but I still love him for what's inside him. Cheesy, I know. What can I do? I'm hypnotized. This was my same reaction withPerfect Chemistry.3.Just like Alex and Brittany, I like how Carlos and Kiara's romance developed. It was so sweet. Their relationship was more fun than Alex and Brittany's, in my opinion. I can feel so much sexual tension just by their little pranks, and I love that. The cookie/locker prank made me laugh my buttocks off. I love Kiara for that, and I love how Carlos played it cool and got her back. It was so adorable. Although, at times, I felt like their romance was too rushed, I love how there were small events that strengthened it.1. Locker prank - hilarious2. Mountain climb/almost kiss where they both can't stop thinking about each other3. Modeling session where Kiara feels sexual tension *oh sexual tension yes*4. Game when Carlos finds out he doesn't want Kiara to be with another guy *swoon*5. Make-out session at Kiara's house, where they both realize they've fallen in love6. Homecoming where they--- you know the rest, don't you?I loved those events. However, it's not completely oh-so-perfect-I-know-what-I'm-doing moments. I love how uncertain Kiara was about where to touch Carlos. It showed that some girls really are clueless and shy and not everything goes by wonderfully. It was the same when Brittany felt the pain of sex back in the first book. Even though both the boys had sex in the most weirdest/dirtiest/why the hell would you do it there kinds of places. Alex - floor of Enrique's auto shop Carlos - at the lake house in the rain, they didn't seem to care. I mean, as long as they're together. I wouldn't want to do that, though.Carlos is hilarious. I want to smack him, then kiss him because I smacked him, then smack him again for kissing him. Alex and Carlos are so alike. Well, Alex is twenty in this book so he's changed. Back when he was seventeen, though, like Carlos, he was just the same. They were both snarky, egotistical, insanely confident, and slightly rude. However, they were the life of the books. I loved them. If only guys like that existed. Nah... Guys suck most of the time. Too sad.I thoughtRules of Attractionwas better thanPerfect Chemistrybecause of Carlos. Besides his immense sexual appeal, tattoos, confidence, bad boy attitude, (which always attract me), I thought he was hilarious. His sense of humor was dirty and wacked up, but the best. I loved Kiara as well. Brittany didn't astonish me. I didn't like her much. Meh. Kiara is strong, intelligent, and knows what she's doing.One problem was that I felt like she shouldn't have had sex with Carlos before marriage. I felt like she would probably stick to her terms, that her good girl image would stay and change things. I don't know if she was planning on abstaining, but most likely she would have. I'm just assuming. It would have been nice to see at least one couple actually waiting for marriage to come and being patient. I mean, one thing I would probably change about Elkeles's stories is to have her characters actually have sex after marriage. My respect for them would have increased more, but realistically speaking, it would make sense for them to have sex before marriage. Since when do teens in general wait? Yeah, no. Not going to happen.Another thing I would change is the cover. I mean, it's a little too... yeah. I mean, I know they could be naked, but I just wished there would be more meaning to the cover than just two people kissing. Maybe gazing into each other's eyes and blocking out the world. *cheese*I also liked this one better because of how their romance developed. The events were a lot more cuter and more fun for me, as a reader. I'm more of a playful girl who likes to have fun. Carlos and Kiara had so much fun. I'm not saying Alex and Brittany didn't. Brittany just felt like a drama queen to me, and kinda controlled what Alex did. It felt like she was asking him to confess his love all the time. Kiara just went with the flow and waited for Carlos to confess his love. She was patient and understanding.Anyway, another one of my favorites. I loved it. I'm planning on reading herParadisebooks as well. I hope I enjoy them just as much as I enjoyed this series.
