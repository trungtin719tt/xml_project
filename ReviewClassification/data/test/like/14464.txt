In my opinion, this is Clancy's best book, even beyond the Jack Ryan stories. The depth of character coupled with the suspense of an underwater attack submarine chase makes this book so memorable that I read it a second time just to enjoy it again. The plotting is fantastic, but I have to say that it's the way Clancy crawls into the mind of a troubled Soviet sub captain that makes this story so rich for me. We get such a complete picture of the history and psyche of Capt. Ramius that we not only understand the complexity of what he's doing, but feel genuine and complete empathy for him in his plight. All of this is done through the action. Not a moment of suspense is paused while we get Ramius' plight and his desire. The intensity of the onboard and offboard politics is fantastic, and very believable. Great book, and highly recommended.
