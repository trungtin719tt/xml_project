Im IMPRESSED, is what i am!!!!!!I've had this book sitting on my book shelf for ages now, and just hadn't had the time to pick it up. after seeing all the fuss over Leigh Bardugo's new book, (which i also have idly sitting on my shelf), i decided i should read shadow and bone, and as mentioned previously, I'm impressed! This is an instant YA attraction. It's a typical fantasy YA with just enough action, the perfect romance, dancing around a fast paced plot and smooth eloquent writing. The characters are easily depict-able, and their roles are immediately introduced. The book wastes no time getting to the point, and although that is a risky path in fantasy, this boldness only added fever to the book. It took me exactly 4 and a half hours to read this, and not a single second in this consecutive reading did i feel even slightly bored. The book plays with excitement the way a child would with a new toy, cautiously at first and then a reckless swan dive all at once. I particularly enjoyed that little detail.Moving on to the characters; the main character, Alina, is really any other YA female protagonist with hidden talent, and a role to fulfill, but that is not all in all, in any way bad. I think given the way the YA genre works, with all the diversity, at some point at least one character will resemble another from a different story. However; it is adamant, that the simple and minor details shaping her main character create a sense of uniqueness, a sort of trademark to her writing. I believe the naivety of Alina expressed so honestly and openly got my attention, the simple reality of an insecure girls desire to fit in and be wanted, if not necessarily loved. The world created around her has its flaws, but i think perhaps its the perfect imperfections that make this world desirable. The way the world revolves and builds, and then simply unravels once again, it made me feel as if i were living in this alternate reality.The book had incredibly good pace, and it was truly action riddles. The descriptions of opulence and grandeur, and likewise destruction and chaos were vivid, yet not excessively detailed. i felt like the book prodded and pushed your imagination but didn't try to override it, something i truly appreciated.i just have an inexplicable pull towards all things dark and evil, and then right there in the middle a beacon of light coming to the rescue. I love Mal, and will continue to do so for eternity, because every powerful and troubled heroine needs to be an emotional damsel every once in a while, and who better than the handsome boy who you've been secretly in love with for the past couple of years. I feel however, there is more to the darkling, and i hope we get to see the different side as the book progresses.Cant wait to read the next book!!!!!
