OK!! I am shocked!! I was reading and reading! I reached chapter 7 and then BOOM!! The story was leading to some point but I am not sure I get what is going on! How could Bianca not know that she was a vampire?Ok! She knows but she is confusing me!Another shocker is Chapter 15!! Lucas is a Vampire Hunter!!! I knew something was wrong when he said to Bianca:"Don't ask me to do this. Don't give me that chance." But this I wasn't expecting! Great Book! I liked that there is a character named Dana just like me ;)
