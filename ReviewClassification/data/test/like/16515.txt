Words. That stew in silent torment, weep and curse, howl in pain and outrage. Words that spill from his pen and bleed on to these white sheets to taint our neat black-and-white categorizations. Universes stretch across the extremities of his fictional Jefferson, that swallow lives whole and spit back all the folly men and women are capable of. And images emerge in an unearthly chiaroscuro of mortal agony and transient joy. Colours of spiritual disquiet and alienation and uncertain footsteps towards expiation daubed on to the empty canvas of Yoknapatawpha.Words. That sing to the tune of all human frailty with nary a care for readerly reception. Words that neither bristle with indignation nor rage against injustice but flay open the heartbreak of it all. The colossal human tragedy shorn of its sheen of grandiosity.Now it was still, quiet, the fecund earth now coolly suspirant. The dark was filled with voices, myriad, out of all time that he had known, as though all the past was a flat pattern. And going on: tomorrow night, all the tomorrows, to be a part of the flat pattern, going on. He thought of that with quiet astonishment: going on, myriad, familiar, since all that had ever been was the same as all that was to be, since tomorrow to-be and had-been would be the same. Then it was time.Words. That do not merely align themselves in imperfect harmony to proudly proclaim artistic triumph but are wholly in communion with a sense of time and place. Words brimming over with an abiding tenderness even when they speak of such disconcerting cruelty. Race and gender and religious dogma segue into each other, but it is not just the deep south that is reconstructed from this thematic patchwork but a panoramic view of all human vulnerability. These are words that serenade endurance in the face of inescapable defeat. Words birthing an opera of anguished voices asking for reprieve, for redemption.But there was too much running with him, stride for stride with him. Not pursuers: but himself: years, acts, deeds omitted and committed, keeping pace with him, stride for stride, breath for breath, thud for thud of the heart, using a single heart.Words. That forgive the sins of the doomed, the exiled, and the dispossessed of the earth and the ones who are shrunken under the weight of history. They are filled with hope in the August of their lives, all of a sudden, these broken beings. Hope of surviving decay and flowing into a future which has already severed all ties with them....now and at last they had all played out the parts which had been allotted them and now they could live quietly with one another.Light arcs into this dreary abyss occasionally. Light that flickers and wavers and fuels anticipation. The light of new life that begets optimism in turn. Who knows if it will purge the darkness of it all? But it may.William Faulkner's soulful, mystical words whisper into the ears of eternity this dubious message of renewal amidst degeneration.
