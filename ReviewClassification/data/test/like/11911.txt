I've read some of the other reviews of this book that point out some intellectual garbage that they say can't be proved (without actually looking at the evidence) or the literary problems with the book. They're missing the whole point of it. This book can only be understood with a spiritual sense that many people ignore or fight against to justify their lifestyles. I have been reading this book every night ever since I was in High School. It continually reminds me to be a better person. You can't understand it without reading the book and paying attention to a spiritual sense you may not yet be familiar with.
