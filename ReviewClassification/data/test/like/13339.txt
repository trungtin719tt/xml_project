Another series finished for this year, #winningThe Death CureUmmm, where to begin?This series was such a fast paced, roller coaster filled with amazing twists and turns that kept me on the edge of my seat, and short of breath most of the time! hahaI loved that the chapters were short and generally left on cliff-hangers!I think the first book is still my favourite, but the action in all 3 books never lacked, amazing series, and I highly recommend it! Even if you're kind of resistant like I was! :)
