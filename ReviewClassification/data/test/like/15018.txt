hmmmmmmmmmmmm WELL...Even with a lot of my questions still unanswered...Even though I was still waiting to fall in love with Jericho and that still didn't happen...and even with the ending being spoiled for me(THANKS GIRL WHO PUT THE FREAKING ENDING IN THE FIRST SENTENCE OF HER REVIEW WITH NO WARNING!!! SPECIAL PLACE IN HELL FOR YOU!)I still give this book a perfect five!!!Though all questions weren't answered we learn so much more in this book. I was also happy that there was a lot more action as well!As far as the ending goes... Even though it was brutal and cliffhanging and I can see why some people might not be able to hang I think we can all agree that the way it was executed was done amazingly... so much so that I ran out and bought book four and am starting it tonight.READ THIS REVIEW AND OTHERS OVER ON OUR BLOGSOUTHERN BRED SOUTHERN READSOUTHERN BRED SOUTHERN READSOUTHERN BRED SOUTHERN READ
