This book is a cross between science fiction and fantasy. The author engulfs you into the story from the beginning. The book is full of suspense and energy which keeps the readers glued to the story. The book is filled with an eclectic array of characters all of whom hold the readers interest. The plot is well formulated and fast-paced. The story is filled twist and turns as the characters unearth the supernatural, aliens, and conspiracies. What I liked about the book was that it was not so far-fetched that it was unbelievable. I like that in sci-fi books, I like books that I can believe in and this book meets the bill. I think this book would make a great movie. The writing is good, story line flows and the descriptions painted a vivid picture for the reader.
