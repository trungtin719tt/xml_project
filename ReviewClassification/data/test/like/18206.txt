What surprised me the most about Huxley's book was the fact that it was written in 1932. Some of the imagery of the book's dystopian future were shocking to me, so I can only imagine what the readers of 80 years ago must have thought. It reads much more like a piece of science fiction from the '60s than something from the Depression era. I was also surprised to learn (after getting about half-way through the book) that it is widely considered a very right-wing piece of fiction. I can see where that idea may have originated, since the horrific society depicted in the book is partly the result of the abandonment of religion and traditional families, along with the worship of science, drugs, and free love. However, the awful future we see is also the result of excessive commercialism, corporate worship (our Lord is now "our Ford"), and white supremacy-- hardly leftist ideas. I might be more inclined to agree with the labeling of "Brave New World" as right-wing if the book had been written in the 1960s during the era of free love and civil rights. The characters even wear bell-bottoms, hot pants, and green velvet. So one might say that Aldous Huxley was more prescient in his views on the future of fashion than the future of our society. However, I wasn't reading this looking for a political message. In fact, I believe the best fiction is written when the author sets out to entertain and tell an interesting story with compelling characters. There, Huxley succeeds. It is a compelling piece of science fiction, and for that fact alone I recommend it.
