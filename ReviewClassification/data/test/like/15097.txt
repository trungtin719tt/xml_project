The Pact by Jodie Picoult is one of those rare books which made me feel so helpless that I started crying. There were parts were I wished I could just jump into the book and stop the characters from making all the wrong decisions. The story was rich and has its own charisma which made me want to read it in the first place. Granted I knew what I was getting in to provided it was a Jodie Picoult book after all but I was not prepared for the onslaught of emotions which were headed my way. The story of Chris and Emily who very often compared to the two sides of the same coin, was very endearing. Thrown together from the very childhood itself they did everything together. So in time when there friendship turned into a romantic relationship none was surprised, after all that was the plan all along. But things take a turn for the worst when Emily is killed at the age of 17 and all fingers point to Chris. But that's when Chris delivers a shocking confession that they both entered in to a pact to kill themselves and Emily is dead as a part of it. While Chris's parents are willing to accept this because explanation as having a child who is suicidal is much better than believing they have raised a murderer, Emily's parents much rather believe that their daughter is a victim rather than the alternative. Thus put to test is the 18 year old friendship of their parents. As the story progresses the reader gets further insight in to the relationship Chris and Emily shares. The tough choices made by each of the characters and how it affects the others is a very interesting aspect of this book. The subplots were Chris's mom Gus finds a kindred soul in Emily's father Michael who believes in her son's innocence and his fight with his conscience when he tries to believe he is doing right by his daughter are arresting. But the fact that was a little difficult to grasp was believing that Emily even though spending all the time with Chris was able to keep that much hidden away from him and Chris accepting Emily's decision without any explanation on her part. Emily was a highly unstable and selfish character who was as much as a mystery in her life as in death. But the character I would never forget and will remain one of my favorite characters of all time is Chris. All through the book I kept wishing his life was different although Emily was the one who was in need of it. He handled all his predicaments with a maturity far beyond his age. The character of Melanie Emily's mom who was so willing to crucify a boy whom she came to love as much as her daughter rather than believing herself so incapable of understanding her own daughter is riveting. In the end Pact is a love story in a sense but this is a love story like none other and will leave you with a sense of hope.
