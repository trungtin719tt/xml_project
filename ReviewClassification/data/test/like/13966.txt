Themost reading fun I've had all year! Can I give this book more than 5 stars? This book has it all--the totally unique characters, the imaginative story line, the ultra witty dialogue, the set-the-sheets-on-fire bedroom action, the kick a** heroine, and the number one, sexiest bad-boy 'Master' vampire of all time, the swoon-worthy Bones! Oh my, he may have just replaced Rhage as my all-time favorite vamp! God, the things he says and does...words cannot describe his utter hotness...to try to do so would do him a disservice.:)This book was just jam packed with goodies from the start with nary a slow spot. Half vamp/half human Cat and vampire bounty hunter/former gigolo Bones are temporarily broken up (I never thought it would last4 years!--how could she keep herself from him for4 years?) but the way Bones comes back into her life (*sigh*) you know that Cat doesn't stand a chance in hell of resisting him! Cat has a whole new career working for the government as a Special Agent (complete with her own team of men--who all deserve their own books, btw), ridding the world of some really unsavory vampires. There's lots of grisly battles, but Cat's a tough, cool customer, and can handleanything, except when it comes to her feelings for Bones. And once he steps back into her life you know she's toast.There's lots of violence and some grisly scenes involving some bad vamps (I'm in awe of Jeaniene Frost's wicked imagination), but there's no skimping on the romance. The pages just come alive whenever Cat and Bones are together, and the big romantic scene when Cat tells Bones to not hold back and that she wants all that he can give her...whew...have plenty of ice ready, because you're going to need it! Hot, hot,HOT!!I loved the cat fight (no pun intended) between Cat and the first vamp that Bones 'made', the Susan Sarandon look-alike and devilishly skanky Annette--go Cat, put that b**** in her place! I loved the remark that Cat made to her teammate Tate (who has an annoyingly mad crush on her) while defending her relationship with Bones--"Once you go dead, no one's better in bed."This book was filled with those witty remarks, icluding this one from Bones to Cat..."Hallo, luv. Long time no taste.":)And finally, I loved how the book built and built until the final showdown between Cat and her long lost Daddy vamp, and the vamp who originally 'made' Bones--awesome fight scene that had me on pins and needles and outrageously witty dialogue. And just when you think you've read it all and had enough, Frost throws a big fat curveball at the end and provides some more "ghoulish' entertainment that would make Stephen King proud!Well, I could go on and on about all the entertaining sequences in this book, but what Ilovedthe most was the staggering love between Bones and Cat--they are without a doubt my favorite paranormal romance couple. I just can't get enough of them--they are scorchingly hot! I don't know what else Jeaniene Frost has in store for them, but I'm ready. Bring onAt Grave's End! 5 big stars!
