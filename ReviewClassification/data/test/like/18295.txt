I do not even remember the first time I read A Wrinkle in Time, but years after that first reading, I found a copy in a used bookstore and fell in love all over again. Today I own the box set as well as a few other books by L'Engle and recommend them to people at every opportunity. I was very sad when L'Engle died, for the world lost a literary genius with incredible talent and vision. Don't let the placement of these books in the children's section fool you...children and adults alike can benefit from reading the entire quartet.
