I almost put three stars here, but how does someone "down check" Robert Frost. It's just that I like some of the poems and not some others. Still this is a book of poems that do speak and do stay with you so...4 stars.I don't think I've ever read a poetry book from cover to cover, but instead open up the covers and either search for a poem I'll like or "luck dip".I've had this a long time and don't take it down like I once did, but then I don't often have the peacfulness of mind needed for that pass time.
