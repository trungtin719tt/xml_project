This book is widely acclaimed, an international bestseller yet it has been criticized from time to time.I was going to give it a 3. But 4 stars seems good because this book made me think about alot of things. I even spent a few hours discussing this book with my one and only.Sex and love are two separate things. But lust under the context of love brings these two things together. They are connected.The author talks about sex here with frivolity and levity because the topic is not taboo anymore I think.One can consider this book as a fairytale.A fairytale for adultsWhere the main character is not a princess or a queen or a lady who is destitute.But an intellectual prostitute and yet a naive one.It all comes down to your life choices at last.This is not a self help book neither a book which gives you a perspective of a woman rather a book about a person, her journey through heaven and hell and how her decisions led to something great at last.It is not about what you want to beIt is about what you choose to be.Decisions decisions decisionsThis book is about desires, decisions and maybe sacrifice.It tells you all about sex with other aspects or factors affecting it like pain, suffering, desires, fantasy, love, betrayal, soul and so forth.You either choose to sacrifice to get to your desiresOr you make decisions to sacrifice your desires.The happiness or affliction based upon decisions depends from person to person.Though this book is not meant for all yet I would recommend it.Life leads you or fate and sometimes you lead your life through your decisions be it poor or good.The ultimate destination is either your happiness or regret and affliction which one chooses for oneself and understands this sooner or later.
