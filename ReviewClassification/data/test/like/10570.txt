The Bad Beginningis about three terrible, wicked children named Violet, Klaus, and Sunny, who live with their gentle, agreeable, talented, and handsome distant relative, Count Olaf, soon after their parents tragic and timely death. They come to live in this beautiful, enormous house, where the children wreck havoc on their loco parentis, or legal guardian. I hope everyone reading this knows I am being ironic, because as the Baudelaires know, that all of what I said is untrue. To correct my statement please switch my adjectives of the children and Count Olaf. Sadly, nothing goes right for these children since their parents suspicious death. Meeting Count Olaf is just the beginning of their terrible fortune.I read this book when I was younger. Actually, I read the first three books, but gave up like I do with many series. I became curious of the series once I heard of the show on Netflix. I remember liking it, and I still do. I find it relatable to younger children around Violets, Klaus, and Sunny's ages, because a child might not think a parent is listening. As a parent, or adult, you figure you know what is best, and you are multitasking other subjects, and you quite can't do it all. Somethings have to be cut short. I am not saying parents don't listen, especially if something is serious. I can see why I could be intrigued, and relate to the Baudelaires when I was younger. Other reason of interest is how Lemony Snicket presents the book during the first few pages. He basically says no good will come from this book, and nothing is happy. Of course, you are 1) telling me to put it down, and 2) it can't be that bad, which DUH makes me interested to read the sad, unfortunate story. What a great idea! My last thought is there must be a happy ending! It cannot end tragically! GENIUS, I TELL YOU!I do like Mr. Snicket's writing style. I like the interruptions of the story line, making it sound like it was in the distant past. I thought it was clever of him to add definitions to words for children at this reading level wouldn't know. As a kid/teenager I wouldn't look up words if I didn't know them. He, creatively, is growing the vocabulary of young minds. It was fast paced, and it gets to the point. I think they were with Count Olaf for a week, at most.Well, there is not much else to say. I did watch the Netflix show, and I think it is great! The book, and the show adaptation have minor, minor differences, but nearly the same. Neil Patrick Harris does a wonderful job as Count Olaf, and I completely imagined him while reading. They make fun of the adults a bit, and have tons of corny jokes, which makes me laugh so much. My husband said I was laughing hysterically while watching the show. I do recommend the show if you get a chance.I will continue with series, and with the show. I wonder what everyone else thinks. :) Read my blog atwww.dancingbetweenthecovers.comHappy reading.
