This is another book that I read as a young teenager. I don't think I knew anyone who was Jewish and knew hardly anything about the history of Israel. This book took me way outside my normal white suburban world. It was another one of those thick books that I looked at and wondered how I could ever read that many pages. But I did.I am reading this book again, fifty five years later.I have read a few other reviews of this book and find some that allege it is extremely anti-Arab. This may come from the current Israeli Palestinian conflict. The book starts out with a fairly intense description of the Jewish experience of the World War II holocaust. That is certainly an obvious way to give a good deal of sympathy to Jews. One cannot but sympathize with their status after the war and their desire for a safe homeland.One of the things that people often bring up about the Jews after the war is why didn't they just go back to places where they came from? Why did they need a Jewish homeland? The book goes that link to show why. A good example is Poland were 3 1/2 million Jews lived at the time of the war. The book goes into detail about how they were discriminated against in Poland over many generations and then how the Polish people stood by when the Germans came in and murdered the Jews en masse. Of course some Jews did return to where they had lived before the war but many did not. The book covers this territory very thoroughly.This book is about 90% war and struggle and Jewish success against unlikely odds. The characters are all dedicated foremost to creating a Jewish homeland.
