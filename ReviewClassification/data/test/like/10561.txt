Easily one of the best children's stories I've read, The Bad Beginning is a high stakes, whimsical twist of a fairytale.Count Olaf, the antagonist, ruins everything, but in a way that's super fun to read. As the stakes pile on, and bad luck for the main characters becomes the worst luck, and the tension reaches an all time high, the writing still maintains this playful even keel to keep everything fun and enjoyable.It had me tearing through pages to see just how bad the beginnings got. And I loved every sentence.
