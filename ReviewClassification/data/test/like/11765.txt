I've decided that 2017 will be the year I take on my TBR "long list". I always find myself torn between the ever-growing pile of ARCs and recent releases I want to read, and those books I've been meaning to read forever but keep putting off. So I've decided to read a book from my "long list" alongside the ARCs/new releases I'm currently reading.1Q84got to be the first.Midnight's Childrenwill be the second. And then - deep breath - on toInfinite Jestand maybe the rest of - gasp -In Search of Lost Time.As for1Q84, for a 1100+ page book, it was extremely readable. Very easy to dip in and out of in a way that I suspect some of the others on my list won't be. The translation is perfectly smooth. I enjoyed the story and the characters, especially Aomame, who is a total badass and spends her spare time disposing of men who are violent towards women.It's really hard to explain what it's about. Several people have spotted me reading this beast and have expressed curiosity over the story and I'm like "Um, so it's kind of a magical realism dystopia set in 1984 with parallel universes, religious cults, and a love story". Well, I guess that about sums it up.The story moves between the perspectives of Aomame who "offs" abusive men, and Tengo who is an aspiring novelist. Though their stories are separate for the most part, it becomes apparent as the tale unfolds that Aomame and Tengo's pasts - and futures - are entwined. Aomame's "job" leads her toward the religious cult, Sakigake, and Tengo agrees to participate in a rewrite of a novel -Air Chrysalis- by Fuka-Eri, a young woman who escaped said religious cult.The rewriting of the book sparks many strange events, as the plot gives up some of Sakigake's darkest secrets. As parts ofAir Chrysalisstart to bleed into reality, we see that this might not be the world it always was; that at some point, something changed, and 1984 became 1Q84.I'm not going to lie to you - I have never read a 1100+ page book that didn't waffle on in parts, and this one is no exception. There are times when Murakami's attention to detail, especially attention to the small behaviours of characters living alone, becomes too much, and repetitive. I grew tired of hearing about Aomame's dissatisfaction with her breasts (sex, sexual desire and the human body are some of the major themes in Murakami's work). And yet, I looked forward to picking it up again. The story interested me. The characters interested me.I needed to know what would happen.One thing I can say for certain is that I've never read anything quite like it.1Q84is a bizarre blend of fantasy, religion, sex, and loneliness, and everything is connected in subtle ways. There's a whole lot of synchronicity, which in itself feels like an act of synchronicity, given the mentions of Carl Jung, who himself first explained the concept. But, most of all - and surprisingly - the story is romantic and hopeful. For a book that gets up to its neck in the bizarre and otherworldly, it was pleasing yet strange to see it all come back to a love story. Even a cold unromantic like me was convinced.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube
