This book. This book has kind of hit me like a ton of bricks. I finished reading this book only fifteen minutes ago, but I feel I need to write something now, while all the feels and richness of the story, still linger without permission in my complicated soul.I knew as soon as I began this book, possibly when I was just a few pages in, that this was definitely for me. Despite having never read "The Illiad" I thought I'd go ahead with this first, having seen quite a few positive reviews about this book.This book was an incredible but a somewhat painful experience to be part of. The lyricism in this book flowed beautifully, and I found myself captivated by Miller's story. With each page that I turned, there was something fresh to discover, or something else to cause me to bite my lip with nervousness. Sometimes the tension in these pages were simply unbearable, and I couldn't devour the word on the pages rapidly enough.This is a love story like no other, and it's poignancy is rare to capture. It kind of takes you apart, bit by bit, and I think this story has the ability to move even the hardest of hearts. I was utterly destroyed nearing the end of chapter thirty-two, and the writing was that good, I read it around a dozen times.As usual, I do have a little complaint, which is the plot. For me, it became rather dull just after halfway through reading, but I've overlooked that when giving a star rating, as it was just so beautiful. What an excellent, midweek heart rendering read!
