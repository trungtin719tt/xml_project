This book was so, so, so painfully beautiful! And it was perfect! I couldn't stop reading. I never in my whole life imagined that THIS was what happened after Mia wakes up! I mean, I knew there wouldn't be a "happily ever after" and that they (she and Adam) would have to face so much difficulties, BUT I NEVER EXPECTED that they would just break up! Stop seeing each other! It was so painful to read, Adam was suffering so, so much :(.I really liked the fact that they both achieved their "musical dreams". Adam was a rockstar! How awesome is that? And Mia was some kind of cello prodigy. I was so proud of both of them. ALSO, I loved all the lyrics of "Collateral Damage", every song was amazing, I wish there was a physical album!!!Anddd yes, overall... I LOVED THIS BOOK and I'm so glad I read it! I kept reading and up to the very last chapters I still didn't knew how Gayle would wrap everything up to make me happy. Everything was so messed up and sometimes I thought it was beyond salvation! BUT WHAT SHE DID WAS MAGIC! The last chapters had me tearing up like a baby, tearing up with a big smile on my face!ALSO, ALSO... Adam Wilde has earned a spot in my TOP 10 Book Boyfriend list. I love him so much!!! I want one of those in my life pretty please.
