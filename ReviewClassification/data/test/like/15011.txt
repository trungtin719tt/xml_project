5 starsA thrilling and gripping page turner with a lot of action and almost non stop tension, building up towards the end. I really liked the characters(view spoiler)[and was so afraid Corky would die on me lol(hide spoiler)]with the exception of Gabrielle. I found her to be quite gullible and annoying(view spoiler)[and although she redeemed herself at the end, it wasn't enough for me to like her(hide spoiler)]. Although it did cross my mind who the controller might be, I dismissed the idea(view spoiler)[not wanting it to be him, which proves to me Brown did a good job in character building and getting me to connect with them(hide spoiler)]. I'm a slow reader but managed to read this book (close to 600 pages) in nearly a single day, I just couldn't put it down!
