5 Stars!!This book was so frustrating and angsty and smutty!! I loved it!!!This book was all about Vishous! I was so excited to read about his character! He is so witty and nerdy but sexy and dark at the same time :D His character had an interesting development/coming to age story. He was born from the Virgin Scribe and a brutal warrior named Bloodletter (I must admit that out of all the crazy names in this book, this has got to be the lamest lol). He grew up with his father at a warrior camp and he received no love or compassion from his father. During V's flashbacks he thought about the struggles he faced while at the camp. It was so sad and difficult to read.V also finds out that his destiny is not his own and it has already been decided that once he turns 303 he must become the Primale. The Primale has the interesting job of impregnating all of the Chosen women (40 women!) and creating new warrior/potentially black dagger brotherhood members. This comes to be a problem when V falls in love with a human doctor named Jane!Jane had a traumatic past like V and they connect almost instantly, that is after she is kidnapped by the brotherhood after she performs open heart surgery on Vishous!I adore Vishous and Jane's relationship! Jane is just as witty as Vishous and gives it right back to him when he tries to be sassy! She is so smart and sarcastic and I literally wish I could be her. She openly accepts V's kinky habits and fits perfectly in his world.Also in this book...John finally goes through his transition!!! Its about time!!! He has a heck of an awkward experience after his transition when he is about to be intimate with Layla. It felt so bad for him :( But John finds out that he may have feelings for Xenx! Wow! Definitely did not see that coming!And then it seems like everything crazy happens in the last 50 pages of the book!! Jane dies and then comes back to "life" and the Scribe Virgin is actually nice for once? That was such an emotional roller coaster!! Then Phury says he will become the Primale because he is the only brother who isn't in love with someone they can actually have. Phury is such a loyal and compassionate brother! I can't wait to read about him in the next book!!Overall, this book was fantastic and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it! Vishous has now tied Rhage as my favorite brother!!
