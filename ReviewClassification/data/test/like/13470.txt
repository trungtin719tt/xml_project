Fabulous! You reader are in for a grand time. Davidson is a master storyteller. The reader is given a wonderful and detailed story but you must choose what you will take away as truth or fantasy. Maybe it's a little bit of both. The book has been placed on my favorite shelf. I loved how the narrator is unnamed but he speaks to you as if he personally knows you. A love story at its best with the stamp of redemption all over it. Please Mr. Davidson release another book quickly!
