Dear Harry Blackstone Copperfield Dresden,First of all, the audiobook edition of this story is freaking incredible.James Marsterscould recite the dictionary and I'd be hanging on his every word, but combinethat voicewith the awesome writing of Jim Butcher and I'm in heaven, I'm simply in HEAVEN!The "first book info dump" wasn't too bad here. I easily kept up with the world-building and I loved what the author created. I loved everything about it, actually. My only issue with this story was that it was a bit "the world is conspiring against me" for my tastes. So much $hit doesn't go Harry's way that it became a bit painful for me to read at times. However, all signs point to me loving this entire series so I have the next book locked and loaded, ready to read!I know I'm about 15 years behind the times with this one but I'm on the train now and I'm PUMPED!
