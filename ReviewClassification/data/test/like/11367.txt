As an ardent fantasy lover and someone who creates in the genre, it was an absolute crime that I had never read from the modern fantasy father, before 2018. I am so glad that I have finally completed one of the original fantasy trilogies and now have a deeper understanding, adoration, and respect for where many of the fundamental aspects of the genre stemmed from.Tolkien's conclusion to his epic saga saw the reader journey from the leafy greens of the shire to the desolate and black-rocked Mordor. It saw us convene with cheery-natured hobbits and unite with distrustful elves. It saw us partake of second breakfasts (and berate the later lack of them) and duel in bloody battles with all number of magical creations.This was every bit a fantastic finale as I had anticipated. I felt every page had something to teach the reader and the only thing I want to do now I have completed it is to start all over again!
