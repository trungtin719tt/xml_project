I have to say, right off the bat, that Stoppards's Arcadia is simply the best play I have read to date.But this isn't far behind. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead is an exceptionally good piece of writing - a youthful prank bursting with theatrical mischief and literary flair. Stoppard's philosophizing playfulness here is clearly indebted to the music hall absurdism of Beckett's Waiting for Godot, a play I much admire also. His writing is just so crystal clear and pristine, and it's lost none of it's fresh and inventive appeal.It's plot is quite straightforward - Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are in the (metaphorical/literal) wings of the great events going on stage in Hamlet's struggle for vengeance on the man who murdered his father and usurped the throne. Stoppard juggles reality and ideas, the philosophy of chance and purpose, memory and death, he pulls all the strings in all the right places, it's simply one of the great scripts of 20th-century theatre. I simply don't agree with some who feel it's dated. No way!Stoppard gets the thumbs-up again. Bravo Sir!
