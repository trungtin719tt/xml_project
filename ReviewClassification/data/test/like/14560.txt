I have just re-read this book for about the fifth time. I think it ought to be compulsory reading every three or so years, or it should be imbibed medicinally if one is feeling generally under the weather.As everyone knows - it's the correspondence between the warm and bouncy American scriptwriter Helen Hanff, and the stuffy head buyer of an antiquarian bookshop in London called Frank Doel. Their correspondence spans from 1949 to 1969. Slowly, slowly, Hanff's warm letters melt Doel's English reserve.For all her frivolous outpourings Ms Hanff is well read, and a steady stream of classics find their way across the Atlantic from London to New York. But the traffic isn't all one way. Ms Hanff sends the staff members at the bookshop generous food parcels at Christmas - which are greatly appreciated, especially during the period of post war rationing.The affection between Helen Hanff and the staff of the bookshop cannot fail to melt the heart of any reader. The letters are a marvellous tribute to the joys of written communication, and the pleasure of having penfriends.I wasn't going to do a review of this book, except I have just been alerted to the fact that the film of the book, starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins is showing on UK television tonight, at 10pm on the Drama channel. I have not been smitten with the trailer, but shall record it and give it a go over the next few days.
