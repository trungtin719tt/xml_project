This was a great ending to the Hush Hush Saga! I loved the action in this book. Nora grew up so much and her relationship with Patch was undeniable. I loved how new characters were introduced without it seeming awkward and how old enemies popped back up unexpectedly. I would definitely re-read this series!Patch and Nora have been through a lot.

Nora's arch enemy convinces her mom to let her move in with them making Nora's life that much more hectic. Now she has to figure out how to keep her oaths or lose her life while preventing a war. Will she and Patch stay strong through everything?
