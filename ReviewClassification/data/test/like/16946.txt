Buddy read withAnne!(Click on her name for her review)I was right when I said I was gonna need an acid bath after finishing this book, because this was so damn sick. I need something happy or at least funny to recover from this, I'm serious.Have you ever read a book in which you hatedeverythingand yet didn't hate the book?Dark Placesis one of those books.I loathed every damn word of it, but it was so damn clever and I just can't hate it.Let's start with the characters. You know my enjoyment of a book depends a lot on the characters - how developed they are, how they act, how much I relate to them, etc.Here, none of the characters are likable.First, the narrator Libby Day, whose family was brutally murdered when she was 7 years old, is a liar and a thief. She says so at one point, actually:I am a liar and a thief. Don't let me into your house, and if you do, don't leave me alone. I take things.Her attitude is what really angers me about her, though, because even when she says she's a liar, her narration is honest. Here's how she is: She's that kind of person who isolates herself from others and does it by having a bitchy attitude, if you don't mind me saying that.Truth be told, I'm like that too sometimes, but do you ever pause to think it's easier to hate people who are similar to you? Picture yourself meeting... well, meeting yourself. I bet it'd be a disaster.I cannot talk about the rest of the characters because spoilers, but trust me when I say that:1) They were always either hiding something or were assholes who deserved to die.2) The moment you start feeling pity for someone is when you should start asking yourself, "okay, what awful thing could this person have done?"Really, I meant it when I said everything was sick. The mystery (the why behind it, mostly) is perhaps what's worse about it all.A family murder. When it comes to murders, that's probably the one that gets me the angriest, especially if it involves children.This one is that.Mother (by stab and gunshot) and two of four kids (one is strangled and the other cut with an axe) are killed. Eldest son blamed and youngest daughter (Libby) escapes. After 20+ years the crime is investigated again.Sick, ain't it? Though in my opinion, the crime was handled better inSharp Objects. It felt morenatural- the investigation for it, I mean. And also, it was less predictable, and the twist at the end was more shocking and less... convenient.I'm not saying the entire solution (the answer as to who the killer was) was convenient. It was only a part of it, but putting it here would be equivalent to ruining the book, so only read this if you've read the book:(view spoiler)[Calvin Diehl. I mean, the moment after Libby realised it was Diondra who strangled Michelle, it turned out Lyle too realised who killed the rest of the family. Wasn't that tooconvenient? I wished the answer to the other deaths was another, but well, what other option is there? That Diondra killed them too? She couldn't have. Someone would have noticed before and called the police. Diehl being hired was the only thing that made sense, but still, too convenient.(hide spoiler)]Nonetheless, the mystery was very good.It was impossible to guess it.I had a feeling as to who did it, and I was in part right, but I still was surprised when the answer was revealed, which only shows how good it was, and not to mention the constant suspense. That kept me at the edge of my seat all the time.Good murder mysteries are hard to find (at least for me), and so, I can totally recommend it, but really, listen to happy instrumental music while you're reading this, or maybe buy yourself some ice cream. That should make the experience less dark and somber.Now I'll go get my ice to bathe myself in it (I decided the acid was too much) and start a new happy book (perfect time to continue the Percy Jackson series, don't you think?).
