Holmes and Watson, Sancho and Quixote, Jeeves and Wooster, Falstaff and Prince Hal, Archie Goodwin and Nero Wolfe...to the Pantheon of Great Literary Double-Acts add Zorba and the unnamed narrator of this great novel, whom I persist in thinking of as "Kazantzakis". I have lost track of the number of times I have read this book; I came back to it this time through resonances that I perceived in Vittorini's CONVERSATIONS IN SICILY, and from having recently watched the film version for the first time in many years. I was actually pleasantly surprised by the film; Anthony Quinn, Lila Kedrova, and Irene Pappas all did a fine job bringing their roles to life off the page, and the only plot points that were underfed were those dealing with the Monastery. My major complaint with the film, it turns out, was that the "Kazantzakis" character, played by Alan Bates, was far too much of a milquetoast, as though he was taken at face value from his own account of himself in the novel. Why would Zorba tolerate such a non-entity? It is obvious from the book that "Kazantzakis", for all the disparagement he heaps upon himself, is a character of determination and spirit, worthy of being the "boss" and friend of the great Zorba. Bates plays the role far too priggishly to realize this. Other than that, a splendid movie.What I cherish in this novel is the same thing that I value in Alan Warner's THE SOPRANOS: the message that no matter how terrible and intolerable circumstances are, life is something to be celebrated."For Zorba's dance was full of defiance and obstinacy. He seemed to be shouting at the sky: "What can you do to me, Almighty? You can do nothing to me except kill me. Well, kill me, I don't care! I've vented my spleen, I've said all I wanted to say; I've had time to dance...and I don't need you any more!"
