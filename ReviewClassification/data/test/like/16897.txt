This is my first sarah dessen novel and i really loved it.The book takes on many issues like difficulties with separation of parents faced by child,feeling of being unwanted,and violence.Ruby has to shift with her sister cora and brother in law jammie after left alone by her mom.She wants to be independent, and has issues like not wanting help,staying away from making friends or being unsociable. There is also nate who is so affable and too good.Later on it unravels that he also has his problems to deal.There is much difference between nate and ruby with one being optimistic and friendly and other not while both have their own problems which they had dealt with or are dealing with.This book beautifully deals with emotional and family problems.It shows how to cope up with things.Jammie and cora were also too nice.The book shows the real problems in families one has to deal with and its aftermath repercussions leading to emotional instabilities and affects on mindset.The book is really beautifully written.
