I first read this book many years ago and I remember I fell in love with the Disc World as soon as I read the first few pages. I loved the idea of the turtle swimming through space and the elephants and the rim fall and the eighth colour in the spectrum called octarine. Twoflower and Rincewind were the first of many of Pratchett's characters I would meet who are so helpless and yet who blunder successfully through mishap after mishap. And as for the Luggage! That has to be one of the best inventions ever. I have just reread this book in honour ofTerry Pratchettafter his recent death. However I find - just like last time - I am not going to be able to stop at one. I am back in the Disc World and loving it:)
