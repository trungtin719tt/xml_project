No good deed goes unpunished. That could be the unofficial theme of this novel.I read this as a young adult, loved it, and decided to re-read it after seeing Jeffrey Keeten's excellent review a few months ago. And yes, I still love it, but for different reasons this time around. A much simplified plot synopsis gives us Meg Schlegel, a practical but plain lady of the middle class in England, who, with her sister and brother, live a comfortable life in London, espousing liberal causes and following her heart. She marries a wealthy business man, who is decidedly conservative in his views, and of course trouble ensues on both sides of the families. As I said, this is the bare bones of this story, because the plot zigs and zags, dances and weaves,with lies, secrets, coincidences, maneuvering and manipulation on both sides. The story begins and ends at Howard's End, a country house belonging to the first wife of Henry Wilcox, the aforementioned wealthy businessman.Whenever I'm reading a classic of whatever period, (This one takes place around 1910), I am always surprised to read about conversations and scenes that could have happened just yesterday as far as human emotions and liberal versus conservative viewpoints are concerned. This is not a political novel at all, and I found myself agreeing with both sides at different times, for different reasons. Suffice it to say that do-gooders can sometimes do more harm than good, and poor people are always the losers.I have to compare this novel to finishing a great meal, rising from the table completely satisfied. That's how I felt turning the last page. Man oh man, that was good!
