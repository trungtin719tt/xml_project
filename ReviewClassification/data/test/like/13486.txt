Well, this one will teach me not to doubt you, Sylvia Day!! Those slow and annoying bits in the first half are completely forgotten and forgiven, and I bow to your authorial splendor! Hold onto your hats, kids, 'cause this one is a bumpy, angsty, lusty, desperate ride. Sylvia Day broke out the magical writing pen for this one. Damn, woman, did you ever!And, a personal plea from me to the Author Goddess: please, PLEASE write Brett Kline's story!! You pushed my 'hot rocker' button, now you must deliver;-)5 Big-Ass, Happy Stars!!!
