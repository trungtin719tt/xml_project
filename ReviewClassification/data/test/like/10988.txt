Six thoughts onThe Wasp Factory:1. Yes,The Wasp Factoryhas a lot of disturbing images of a psychotic youth committing violence on people and animals.2. Yes, it's worth it. Everything has a reason, a purpose. The book is full of physical and emotional violence, but it's decidedlynotgratuitous.3. Iain Banks is once again inside my head, but this time it disturbs me rather deeply. I'm mildly OCD. (A good tax lawyer has to be OCD to some extent.) I say "mildly" because my OCD doesn't interfere with my daily functioning, though my wife might disagree. Iain Banks is clearly OCD himself, as he can write first-person obsessive-compulsive characters that think and act exactly as I do. But this book was harder for me than his others because he shows what a fine line there is between merely obsessive-compulsive behavior (some harmless counting, memorizing, ordering, hand-washing, and such) and psychotic behavior (killing and torturing animals).4. Because of the above,The Wasp Factorymakes me afraid of myself.5. I'm not reallythatafraid of myself, however, as the main character inThe Wasp Factoryhas specific reasons for his crazy--things that happened in his past, things outside of his control and utterly unjust and cruel--and those reasons are what tipped him over the line from OCD to crazy. At least, I hope those things were the trigger ...6. The actual Wasp Factory itself--not the book but the ingenious machine the protagonist creates--is fascinating. Just the sort of thing I could see doing myself that would cross the line from OCD to actual crazy behavior without harming any people or animals ... except, of course, the wasps that are put through the Factory ... and wasps have caused enough trouble in my own life that I wouldn't mind some payback ;)
