One of the good things about getting a cold in the middle of summer is you have an excuse to spend a couple days in bed reading. That's what I've been doing, and I'm glad I picked this book. It's the final book of Ben Peller's "To Live" trilogy. I was a bit startled because it didn't seem to have a total connection to Los Angeles. But still, it was a cool fantasy type book. There are many heroes in this book, and I was happy I spent my "sick time" with them. I feel better now and am heading out to greet the day, but wanted to leave this review. This book is very enjoyable.
