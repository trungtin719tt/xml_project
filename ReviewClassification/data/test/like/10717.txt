"You've slipped under my skin, invaded my blood and seized my heart. You have poisoned me"~ ValekWhen I sit and read a book in one sitting it gives weight to the Awesomeness of the read. This jewel was brilliant from the very first line. I'm so glad I decided to give it a read. I can't wait to move unto book two. I loved every blinking thing about it. The storyline, The heroine, the side characters, Valek and lastly, but by no means least, Valek ; )) The storyline was fantastic, the characters had depth, whilst being engaging, memorable and lovable all at once. My only regret was not reading this book sooner.This was me literally whilst reading this bookThe plot twist and discoveries along the way had me like:This is a must read, I guaranteed that you will:10 Valek is Bae Stars
