This book is about a house cat who is tired of being a house cat and wants to go into the wild. Then he mets a kitten from a 'clan' and goes with him into the forest and mets the rest of the Thunderclan. This book sounds boring, but really, it is a great book. The author is very descriptive and makes it all very interesting. There a four clans, Thunderclan, Windclan, Riverclan and Shadowclan. The whole series, and there are a lot of them, is about the four clans fighting to stay alive and also trying to be friends with the other clans. There are also new series, calld the New Prophecy, they are about different cats and different problems, but all the series join together. It really doesn't sound that great, but you should just try, you will be suprised. This is the first book out of all of them, after you have read it though, you need to read the rest.
