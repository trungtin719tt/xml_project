2007 reviewI just love this book, really. It makes me smile just to think about it. I've read it twice now, and in a year or so will be ready for a re-read. The movie is good, too, but I love the book best, An Utterly Delightful novel about the magic of life.From the PublisherPractical Magic isa tale of two sisters, Gillian and Sally Owens, brought up by their two elderly guardian aunts in a world of spells and exotica from which they eventually escape - one by running away, the other by marrying - but which never escapes from them. Many years go by before strange circumstances thrust them together again, and again they are in a world that blends the mundane and the mysterious, the familiar and the fantastic, the normal and the numinous. Three generations of Owens women are then united in an experience of unexpected insight and revelation, teaching all of them that the perceptions provided by what is called the magical are rare and wonderful endowments.2017 review: Fun to listen to on audio after reading the recently publishedThe Rules of Magicwhich is a prequel. Husband wanted to read it so we listened to the book on audible. Didn't hold up as well as I'd have liked, and while we did enjoy it, I have to agree with Javaczuk that Hoffman's style of description is a little like the "Most interesting man in the world" commercials.
