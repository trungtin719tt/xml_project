The usual crash between the book&amp; the movie...Tom Hanks of course wins,,, Forrest&amp;Jenny relationship was, somewhat, to me ,inspiring, and so true, real, authentic,,,I quite impressed &amp; touched by the content of the work, seeting aside some inquiries concerning the development of the characters &amp;plot progression,,,After all, Sentiment prevails :)
