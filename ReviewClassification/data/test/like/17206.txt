I thought this book was absolutely amazing, Max is as always probably one of my favorite characters out there. She's funny, sarcastic, and is completely badass. And of course I love the rest of the flock too, Gasman, Iggy, Fang, Nudge, and Angel(Though, I don't know how I feel about her). I can't wait to finish off the rest of the series now :)
