A merry-go-round of grotesqueries &amp; infinite pain. The life of the junky means nothing and so the experience is circular-- a self-(or is it?)punishment, an act of extreme nihilism--this is a cry from the very depths of hell, and the last time I checked the most successful account of it was by a man named Dante Alighieri.Burroughs out-writes those terribly true duds of literary fame, mainly Henry Miller, Kerouac, et al. This is incendiary, fantastic, simply put, a bonafide WORK OF ART. In my mind "On the Road" is but a dull Norman Rockwell, "Naked Lunch" an overpowering "Guernica."Experience this hell-on-page &amp; immediately go out to the world to enjoy your heaven!P.S. What a difference ten years makes! I tried to read this right after high school &amp; failed. I feel better for my innocence.
