Love is not the absence of logic,but logic examined and recalculatedheated and curved to fitinside the contours of the heartAHHHHH *squeals into pillow*I LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!It wasso easyto devour, get lost, and fall in love with every single word on that page.And Lucas....*swoons*This is about a college girl named Jacqueline (internally cheers because OMG ITS MY NAME IN A BOOK) who just had her boyfriend of three years break up with her and decides to go to a Halloween party with her friends. As she's leaving the party, she gets attacked and then rescued by Lucas*fans self*They begin to grow closer...and that's all I'm going to tell you! It's so much more fun just to go in blind and read it!"The night we met- I'm not like that guy." His jaw was rigid."I know tha-" He placed a finger over my lips, his expression softening."So I don't want you to feel pressured. Or overpowered. But I do, absolutely want to kiss you right now. Badly."I loved, loved the romance of the college setting! How he would sit in the back and sketch her, and how she would try not to look over her shoulder at him. So sweet! He was like in love with her before he met her and ahhhh it was adorable!As for being somewhere you're not supposed to be--Maybe you're here for a reason, or there is no reason.Jacqueline was so strong! I loved how she didn't let what happened to her get in the way of her overall happiness and how she slowly started to tell people about it. Obviously she should have gone to the police right away but in that moment, in the state of shock, she was so scared that I felt for her so deeply. I loved the way that serious issue was talked about in this book. It was raw and real and horrifying but handled perfectly. And I loved when she told Erin and the two of them started taking self-defense classes! I really enjoyed those interactions and this whole story makes you want to take self-defense classes and be just as strong as Jacqueline!Apologies could come too late.And in the midst of dealing with the post trauma from that night, she is also dealing with the repercussions of a break up from her boyfriend of 3 years!Time would not change what I was feeling-or not feeling. I'd had time and though the ache from his desertion hadn't disappeared, it was decreasing. My future was blurry, yes, but I was beginning to imagine a future when I would no longer miss him at all.There was definitely a sense of empowerment from this book, both from Lucas and Jacqueline. It's clear that Lucas is also trying to overcome a heart breaking past and I loved seeing them be there for one another and come together...As he leaned over me, I felt heightened awareness of every part of my body that touched a part of his--the edge of his hip pressed to mine, his chest sliding against mine, his fingers tracing from wrists to forearms and then framing my face. He held me in place, lips near my ear. When he kissed the sensitive spot, my breath shuddered. "You're so beautiful," he whispered, moving his mouth to mine.*clutches heart*THE ROMANCE.LUCAS! He's so mysterious, so hot, and so fantastic to read! Ahh I fell completely in love with him! He's sweet, sexy, and smart. What more could a girl want? I loved how he was so protective over Jacqueline and yes there was some back and forth but then you get to end and all of it just clicks and then your heart breaks all over again.He brushed my tears from my face."How did I find you?"Overall, this book was highly addicting, emotional, beautiful, heart pounding and so wonderful to read. The writing was fantastic, the characters were real, and it was such a joy to read. I can't recommend this book enough. All I feel when I want to talk about is justGUSHand squeals because ahhhhh LUCAS AND JACQUELINE! I loved every single aspect of this book and highly recommend! Especially if you're looking to get into New Adult, this is a good one to start with! So much love!!"Choosing to be with you isn't a difficult decision Jacqueline," He breathed, pulling back one more time to stare into my eyes. "It's easy. Incredibly easy."
