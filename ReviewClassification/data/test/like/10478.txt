5 Stars!This book was absolutelyamazing!!The plot was captivating and I never experienced a boring moment while reading! This book is about Rhage and Mary and their relationship. Their relationship was bumpy from start but that's what kept me interesting. It wasn't just a normal fairy tale and they instantly fall in love with each other. I was actually surprised that Rhage "cheated" on Mary after he professed his love for her. I did not expect that at all!Mary's character development was so interesting and well written. The progression of her disease was such a tear jerker! And OMG THE PLOT TWIST AT THE END...NO WORDS... :OI also loved how this book started uncovering Zsadist's and Bella's relationship! I cannot wait to read about that in the third book!!Overall, I definitely recommend this book (and the series) to readers that love romance and fantasy/vampires!!
