This book this book this book was just so PERFECT.OH GOD, it was everything I wanted and more! It has been a really LONG time since a book left me so happy and warm inside. I'm floating. And I flew through the pages of this book, I finished it in just one day and I couldn't stop. I couldn't get enough.GOD, Warner. Warner was so beautiful in this book. Every single word he spoke was beautiful and REALLY, every time he was in the pages of this book I was grinning like an idiot, because that is the effect Aaron Warner Anderson has in me. I'm totally in love with this beautiful broken boy. I love the way he always believed in Juliette and how much he loved her and MY HEART IS IN PAIN BECAUSE THE FEELS. We learn so much about Warner in this book and I can't thank Tahereh Mafi enough for that. And for writing such an awesome, badass, interesting and beautiful character. Warner have just made it to the TOP 3 of my book boyfriends, and I have to tell you, is really hard to earn a spot there (yeah I know I'm crazy).I also really loved the whole development in Juliette's character. She was so PROACTIVE and FEARLESS in this book and I was so so so thrilled for her! I liked this Juliette a lot. She didn't frustrate me at all and I am genuinely happy for all she has achieved :')...And ah... I highlighted half of the sentences in this book. Tahereh Mafi's writting never ceases to leave completely BREATHLESS. And Kenji, I loved him in this book, too...Why can't I have more of this trilogy? I want an epilogue and I just want more Warner please.OH GOD I'm so in love with this book.
