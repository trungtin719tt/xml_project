This review can also be found atCarole's Random Life in Books.I am having a lot of fun with my audio re-read of this series. It has been a little more than five years since I read this book the first time so it was definitely time to revisit this wonderful story. This was a book that once I really got into the story, I didn't want to put it down. I ended up listening to the whole audiobook in just a couple of days and I think I liked the book even more the second time around.I do have to admit that I had a bit of a rough start with this book. This book begins several years after the events of the previous book where Cat left Bones to protect him. She is working her government job that she took to protect her mother at the end of the first book. She is very good at her job and has a good team working around her.I learned something very important while listening to this book. I like Bones a whole lot more than I like Cat. So much more. Bones wasn't around for the first part of this book so it was all Cat. I missed Bones. A lot. As soon as Bones entered the story again, my enjoyment increased dramatically. If you had asked me a year ago, I would have told you that I loved Cat and Bones. I discovered that I do love Bones but Cat has the potential to drive me a little crazy at times. Maybe by the end of my re-read of the series, I will love her just as much as Bones.There are quite a few really important developments in this book. Bones and Cat are reunited which is a very good thing. Cat is in some danger which is not so good but Bones is able to help keep her safe since he is back in her life. We do also get to meet some other important characters including Cat's team and some of Bone's friends and acquaintances. There are some pretty intense action scenes and some scenes that are more than a little hot.Tavia Gilbert does such a great job with this series. She really brings both Cat and Bones to life. I love the voice that she used for Bones and think that the accent is perfect. All of the characters are very easy to distinguish with each voice used being unique and very believable. She handled a wide range of emotions and a lot of different types of scenes with ease in this book. I had no trouble listening to this book for hours at a time.I do highly recommend this series to others. This is the second book in the Night Huntress series which really should be read in order since each book builds on previous events. I can't wait to continue my re-read of this amazing series!Initial ThoughtsI had fun with this one. I had a bit of a rough start with it though. I found that I am a much bigger fan of Bones than I am of Cat and Bones was absent during the first part of the book. Even when Bones was back in the story, Cat still drove me nuts at times with her actions and jealous behavior. Don't get me wrong...I still had a great time with it. Tavia Gilbert did a fantastic job with the narration.Book source: Audible purchase
