One of my roommates is a huge John Green fan, and after first introducing me to the series of videos he does with his brother (search "vlogbrothers" on Youtube or just watchthis one), she told me that I should probably read some of his books. She suggestedAn Abundance of Katherinesto start with, maintaining that it's better thanLooking for AlaskaandPaper Towns. (incidentally, can anyone verify/disprove this claim? Just wondering)So I read it, and I have to say I quite enjoyed it. And since I've been watching Vlogbrothers videos for at least two months now, it felt less like I was was reading some random book and more like I was reading something written by someone I actuallyknew. Which, I'll be honest, was a little weird. But cool.Anyway, the book is fun, kind of silly, full of very interesting footnotes and math, and pretty damn funny. Some other reviewers have complained about the main character, Colin, but I always enjoy a socially handicapped former child prodigy. And if that socially awkward former child prodigy happens to have dated (and been dumped by) eighteen girls named Katherine and insists at one point "Love is graphable!", so much the better. His narration is also very fun."When he exited the bathroom, his parents were sitting together on his bed. It was never a good sign when both his parents were in his room at the same time. Over the years it had meant:1. Your grandmother/grandfather/Aunt-Suzie-whom-you-never-met-but-trust-me-she-was-nice-and-it's-a-shame is dead.2. You're letting a girl named Katherine distract you from your studies.3. Babies are made through an act that you will eventually find intriguing but for right now will just sort of horrify you, and also sometimes people do stuff that involves baby-making parts that does not actually involve making babies, like for instance kiss each other in places that are not on the face.It never meant:4. A girl nmaed Katherine called while you were in the bathtub. She's sorry. She still loves you and has made a terrible mistake and is waiting for you downstairs."
