I'm going to divide my review of this into 2 sections: me as a reader, and me as a writer:I love reading books that straddle that line between profundity and enjoyment. In "Notion", Kesey tackles some difficult themes--union busting, technology infringing upon humans involvement with the means of production, sex and family politics/roles, revenge, alcoholism, social stigmas--yet the book never feels didactic or preachy. He avoids this because of the tone with which he wrote the book: it's fun to read. Not to oversimplify things, but too often I think we muddle things up as we dissect or deconstruct literature. Some times, maybe it's better to write a fun, kick ass, hilarious, vivid, sad, confusing, all-encompassing messy book! There's a vitality and life in this narrative; it almost feels conversational, like someone's whispering it in your ear. And so it engages the reader on a personal level, lures us into the complex story with its relaxed, self assured style.The writer side of me: Kesey is doing things with point-of-view that are/were groundbreaking: his willingness to have multiple characters talk in the "I" voice all in the same paragraph is an incredible risk. I admire his confidence to write in this wild way, seemingly not to worry (or care) whether or not the reader gets confused (he does give clues as to the speakers' identities, but it's still bemusing). He's asking a lot of his audience, in terms of active participation with the narrative, but if you're willing to do the work, this novel is amazing. But if you don't like "working" a bit to decode what's happening on the page, this one probably isn't for you.Definitely in my top five all time...
