This book is not about fear but rather about the love of being afraid-- for the ravenous gauging of limits. Adrenaline is searched for.... neurosis &amp; a collective paranoia ensue. &amp; cause, naturally, follows effect."Books are frequently very good carriers... Materializations are often best produced in rooms where there're books. I cannot think of any time when material was in any way hampered by the presence of books." [186]There is an aura of authentic literary splicing here: the psychological novel (think Charlotte Perkins Gilman's "The Yellow Wallpaper") and the horror of microsocieties doing their malignant will-type stories (think "The Lottery", as exceptional a short story as this is a superb haunted house prototype, an ingenious fountainhead for all future horror maestros to drink from). The haunted house is in actuality a person who is on the precipice, the verge of disaster; here is the quintessential tome about the inner demons becoming unleashed and wreaking havoc in horrific ways.A handsome legend, an essential myth. There would be significantly scant haunted house lore without this gothic gem.PS: EVERYONE, READ THIS FOR THE HOLIDAY*!*HALLOWEEN, AUTUMN HARVEST, SAMHEIN. Whatev.
