Well... So I do believe I saved a book's life. About to be tossed away, being a pariah of the garage sale variety, I not only took it home; I READ it. Aglow with endearing cliches, this is the source of plenty of adventure stories, many of which are films, comics, etc.Verne's imagination is grand &amp; the plot is silly and almost kid-like. But absurd it ain't. It is fun exactly because there is a topsy turvy madness to visiting places just to prove a point. It is fun because it is rife with interesting observations, factoids, themes that in Verne's day were barely in development. There is romance, the plot is thick with well... things happening, a ticking clock looms a large shadow, and a velocity is masterfully established that seems almost incredibly doable-- the reader wants to experience this. (Airplanes suck ass anyway!)
