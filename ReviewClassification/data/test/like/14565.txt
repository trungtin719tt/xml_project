In the interest of full disclosure (or because putting myself on display via book reviews is a more palatable vehicle for my innermost self these days than, say, the more self-respectingly private venue of a journal is), I originally wrote this review as a series of letters between84, Charing Cross Roadand me, but it was one of those times when emulating the format just wasn't working (for one thing, I kept writing the book's responses far too snarkily, which I think may have been the result of being rubbed the wrong way by Ms. Hanff early on in the book, probably because she seems far more at ease with busting out the joshing jocularity during the fledgling stages of a friendship than I will ever be).In that same vein, you probably also need to know it is with a mug of bright red tea on one side and a bottle of even redder wine on the other as Zep serenades me across the decades through my computer speakers (which, at a certain point, will be reduced to me playing my two favorite songs over and over until I'm satisfied enough to let the album end) that I am sitting here trying to formulate something vaguely resembling a proper tribute to a book that is, at its heart, a love letter to the bonds that are born of a shared love of reading.Is there a more perfect book than84, Charing Cross Roadto discuss on a site that has led so many of us to friendships that began with books? How many casual comments or hesitant pushes of the "add as a friend" or "follow reviews" buttons were disguised as auspicious beginnings to an ever-deepening bond with someone you may never meet face-to-face but consider a close friend? How many countless times have we reaped the real-life benefits -- be it a change of mood for the better over some well-timed kind words or the always welcome surprise of a mailed package of books -- of the digital realm because of the connections we've made on this site?What begins with a poor writer's quest to feed her lust for antiquated book becomes a volley of letters and exchanging of goods across the pond as Helene Hanff and the staff of a London bookstore forge the kind of close-knit kinship I've never even had with my own family. While Hanff's early letters did not endear her to me at all, I realized the fault was probably my own by the time her first shipment of foodstuffs made its way to her ration-constricted pen-pals at Marks &amp; Co. And that's about when I realized this book was going to tell me a little somethin'-somethin' about how actions have a way of speaking louder than words and that maybe I ought to ignore the little judgmental voice in my head that just loves to run its hypothetical mouth.Because there is a current of fondness that is just rushing through these letters that transcends distance and time and circumstance and is just impossible to ignore as the epistolary narrative subtly betrays just how much platonic love and friendly admiration exist among Hanff, her primary writing buddy Frank, his wife and the coming-and-going cast of characters who help keep the bookshop running.The ongoing disappointment of Hanff's many thwarted attempts to visit London and her long-distance friends is what resonated the most poignantly with me, as I am all too familiar of how the best-laid plans seem to fall apart spectacularly at the least opportune times. There is a point when some of Hanff's hometown chums travel abroad and wind up at Marks &amp; Co., only to find themselves "nearly mobbed" once they mentioned their common comrade to the shop's staff. Not too long after that, a letter lobbed to Hanff from the usually reserved Frank contains the line "... one more summer will bring us every American tourist but the one we want to see" and I very nearly dissolved into a puddle. If I hadn't already been charmed by the folks populating this charming testament to how the longevity of friendships is not dictated by proximity but rather by personality, that would have been the line that both swayed and slayed me.The sweetness of these letters is not tainted by a saccharine sentimentality, and Hanff's earnest pursuit of good reads remains unmarred by pretentious showmanship. It is, actually, not entirely unlike what I imagine what would happen if one were to follow the course of a GR-forged correspondence across two decades, only that I hope you folks are all still around to reap the royalty benefits by then. Because I am half a bottle of wine poorer than I was when I began this "review," I can now safely use this book as an excuse to sloppily profess my love for you guys before passing out as inelegantly as possible. Consider this my drunk-dialed midnight confession of affection to you all, which, I think, is exactly why a book like this exists in the first place.
