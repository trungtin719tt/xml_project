This book takes place "now" and "then". This confused the heck out of me for the first couple chapters probably because I didn't pay attention to the chapter's titles I was just so excited to get reading. "Then" starts in August and is everything that takes place from the minute Lena left Alex and ran into the wilds. We get to see every heartbreaking struggle as she found a new place to stay and met new people. She isn't sure whether she wants to live or die but she wants to be strong for Alex. She tries to imagine him and that she is getting stronger for him. Her thoughts of Alex continued to bring tears to my eyes throughout these scenes as well as all the hard struggles of life in the wilds. It is definitely not easy living free."Now" is in March and takes place in New York. Lena has joined the resistance, has a fake identity and is living among the cured. She is attending DFA(Deliria-Free America) meetings and rallys, keeping an eye on all the activity. People are more aware of the invalids and deliria now and want to give the cure at a younger age. They want to risk people dying from receiving the cure in order to lessen the chances of infecting the world. Although some are against this and don't want to risk death so the rallys get a bit crazy. Lena is told to keep watch on the son of the head of the movement, Julian Fineman. But during a big rally they both end up getting kidnapped. Lena has become really brave and strong now. She fights for their escape but there are lots of twists and turns along the way. I loved the action and couldn't put the book down. Finished it in one day! Lauren Oliver is amazing at keeping me emotionally invested and captivated.But......there were a few things I personally didn't like about this book. I think the whole new love interest/love triangle cat is already out of the bag since it is mentioned in the description but all I'm going to say is pull out your Team Alex flags because I'm sorry to say it is definitely going to get ugly in Requiem. I was also really disappointed with it. The reason I loved Delirium so much was the fact that it was such a beautiful love story about sacrifices being made to be together and in Pandemonium I just feel like Lauren Oliver took a big ole crap on it. I'm just really sad with the story going the love triangle route. I am also really upset with a few details to it. They are in the spoiler button since they are a bit more spoilery so read at your own risk.(view spoiler)[Lena asks like ONCE the people she ends up with if they heard what happened to Alex. She barely pushes them. She doesn't even mention his name. The girl even heard about it!!! It was so big everyone was talking about it but Lena didn't investigate?!! She doesn't CONTINUE asking other people in the wilds if they heard anything! She doesn't look into it at all!Lena has a chance to look at the prison list and wants to see her mom's name but doesn't even think to check for Alex's name!!!(hide spoiler)]My last disappointment was that this book has one of the most horrible cliffhangers ever and I am willing to sell my soul to get my hands on the next book!!! It was an evil evil evil ending!!!!! After Delirium I think the author could have went a little easier on us. Don't worry we will be back for Requiem, you didn't need to do this to us! Once you read it you will understand and hopefully come back and freak out with me. If you have already read it and want to rant and discuss, direct message me, seriously!THAT ENDING!!!SON OF A BISCUIT!!!!! WTF!!! OMG!!!! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!! #$$@#T@^#@&amp;^#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!![image error]
