I found this book in our cabin up on Monhegan Island in Maine. I'm the biggest baby when it comes to romance. We were sitting there playing Scrabble (there's no tv) and listening to Delilah on the radio. I was already almost finished with this book, so I read it between my turns. I just started flat out bawling at the table in front of everyone as I finished. It's such a quick read, but man does this book pack an emotional punch. The characters really come to life. Although their basic descriptions may seem like the stereotypic rich boy and poor girl, the family interactions and heartache really hit home. I did read the sequel to this book, but I like to just pretend it was based on totally different characters. The emotional dynamics of the second just can't compare.
