This is one of my favorite of all books, best known for the novella that opens the book and provides its title. It may be a book that could only have been written by someone in his seventies, as Maclean was when he began it. On the surface, it's a story about Maclean, his gifted but fundamentally flawed brother, their father, the land that they loved and the religion of fly fishing that bound them together. But it's also a book that has a great deal to say about the bonds that tie family members together and about the heartache that can result when one of those family members desperately needs help that none of the others is able to give.Most of all, it's about the memories and relationships that one forges during the course of a long and interesting life as told from the bittersweet perspective of the last survivor. It's a beautifully written book, spare and lean, with passages on virtually every page that will dazzle and haunt a reader long after he or she has finished reading it.
