I just finished a 1 1/2 year study of The New Testament. I think it was my 2nd time reading it all the way through. This 2nd time through was a much more in-depth study. I loved my study and I learned so much. My favorites parts were reading about Paul and then the Book of Revelation. Revelation has always fascinated me and so it was very interesting to really dig in and satiate my curiosity. One of my favorite verses is in Revelations 21:4, "And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes; and there shall be no more death, neither sorrow, nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain: for the former things are passed away." Isn't that awesome? I love that! As to my thoughts about the apostle Paul, what an amazing man! He had so many trials that he had to live through and overcome. But he did not lose his faith in God once and he continually praised God and was always looking for missionary moments. What an example to me, especially going through the trials that we are currently experiencing.My love for my Savior Jesus Christ increased as well. It is hard for me to express in words the feelings I feel towards Him. I have learned how important "the one" is to Him. He went about doing good continually. He healed many who were ill, both physically and mentally (Luke 4:33-41). He wasn't too busy with his everyday schedule to take time out for "the one." How thankful I am for His atoning sacrifice for me. I know He loves me and knows me personally.
