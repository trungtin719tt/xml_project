Jodi Picoult delivers another excellent novel about family relationships, friendships, courtroom drama, a love story, suicide and so much more. This certainly is a page turner and one that could lead to a great bookclub selection. Picoult's novels are emotionally draining because she skillfully writes about problems that exist in society. 4 stars
