I wasn't expecting that I would be on the verge of tears, but the latter half, particularly the last chapter cannot be read without a poignant, heart-wrenching grief over the recognition "the world is going to end."It was such a blow to me.There is not much going on in the first half, just descriptions of the banality of everyday life, if you like, but in the latter half, the notion of dooms day slowly creeped in throughout, which made me feel so sad that I had to put it down.The writing is generally calm and collected throughout, people are talking about their last day, some even talk about what to do about their garden or household chores that'll be left after they are gone.That's actually what heightened the poignancy for me - realizing that their days are numbered, yet still they go on with their lives.This book is not your average apocalyptic novel, it's not like your average hooks-you-on-adrenaline type of books with lots of exciting, thrilling twists. But it will definitely make you THINK about what you would do when you faced the end of your life, on your last day on earth. I highly recommend this.
