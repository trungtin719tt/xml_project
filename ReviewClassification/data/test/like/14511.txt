Love, love, love this book!! It good be because I enjoyed it so much 12 years ago, but I think it still holds up. Within this book, my favorite story is Daughter of Darkness. I just hope that L.J. Smith is finally able to publish the last book in the series. I've been waiting soooo long to finally find out what happens.
