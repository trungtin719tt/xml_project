Right now, I would read an obituary if it was written by Laura Hillenbrand. What a gift for words!I was very apprehensive about reading about a racehorse when I started the book, twenty minutes into the book, I was hooked. The fact that I had no idea about horse racing history made it even better; I had no idea what Seabiscuit had and hadn't, won so every race was thrilling.The little forays into lives of jockeys and horsemen in 1930s America were particularly brilliant. I would gladly read a book about this.The only thing that irked me a little was that I could sometimes figure out if the Biscuit had won the race just by the descriptions of the start of the race.The amount of research that must have gone into a book like this must have been immense, the footnotes reveal that there is little to no hyperbole in the story. It's so riveting, it's hard to believe that this is real life.
