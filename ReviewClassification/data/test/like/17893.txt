12/23/18: It never ceases to amaze me how well Terry Pratchett, an atheist, understood the nature of belief, of how belief is a peculiarly human characteristic and what it means that humans need things to believe in, for good or ill.Hogfatheris one of my favorite Christmas books, and I try to re-read it every couple of years at this season. This time, I particularly loved the computer Hex's transformation into a believer in the Hogfather, and how that made it just as entitled to a relationship with that god/anthropomorphic personification/demiurge as any human child. I also love Susan's relationship with her grandfather Death, and how Death both fully understands human nature (in the way he gets Susan involved in the Hogfather's disappearance) and really, really doesn't (in practically everything else.)Two scenes come to mind when I think of what this book says about the Christmas season. One is the "Good King Wenceslas" scene, where Death interrupts a king giving his leftovers to a proud, poor man who never asked nobody for nothing. Death's well-made point is that the king gave of his abundance not because he cared for the man, but because it made him feel good to receive gratitude. I have been in the position of receiving well-meant but humiliating charity, and it's made me conscious of my own motives--giving is all very well, but where am I the other 364 days of the year?The second is the "Little Match Girl" scene (this book is heavily populated with references to familiar Christmas stories) in which Death intervenes to keep the little girl alive rather than let her die to be a heartwarming tale for the more fortunate to remember and be grateful they aren't a frozen child dead in the snow. I don't like Christmas stories whose purpose is solely to tug at the heartstrings, to evoke emotion on the back of other people's tragedies, and the image of Pixie Albert pelting the angels with snowballs makes me laugh.12/24/16: I love this book. The interactions between Death and his granddaughter Susan are perfect. It's something I re-read every year, a reminder of all the symbolism behind the waning of the year. And there'sso muchgoing on in this book: the wizards and their investigation of why there's suddenly a Verruca Gnome and a Cheerful Fairy wandering the halls of Unseen University, the horribly creepy Teatime and his clever but simple plan to "inhume" the Hogfather, Death's scramble to keep the sun rising, and Susan, caught up once again in her grandfather's plan. The Auditors are probably my favorite of Pratchett's villains, because they are so antithetical to life in all its shapes, and yet are torn by the same impulses to become individuals that humans are. It's a marvelous story, with a deeper meaning beneath the humor of the surface: Remember the poker.
