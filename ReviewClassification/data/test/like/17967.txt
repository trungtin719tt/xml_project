Now this was an awesome first book for Brent Weeks. I wasn't sure if I'd call it 5 stars or 4, but I remembered just how engaged I felt through most of the story so I gave the higher ranking.I cared about the characters. Kylar, Durzo, Elene, Momma K, Uly, Count Drake, Logan, Solon, Dorian, Feir, and Jarl were a great cast of protagonists. I couldn't stand Rat, Roth, King Aleine, or the Godking.Durzo Blint was my favorite character. I won't go into that too much as it could spoil; much of his character development is what I like about him.Kylar reminds me somewhat of Fitz, from Robin Hobb. The kingdom of Cenaria and the crime network remind me of Scott Lynch. The scheming and plot turning remind me of Joe Abercrombie. The trio of Solon, Feir, and Dorian remind me of a Steven Erikson sub-plot. Finally, the scope of the international conspiracy reminds me of George R.R. Martin. But what I see in Weeks is more than a sum of these parts; his story is definitely his own, with his own voice. His characters and their problems come to life on the page and keep the reader on the edge of shadows.On to book 2!
