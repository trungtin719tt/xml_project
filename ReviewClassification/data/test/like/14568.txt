It was a small book, interesting to read.But after the first quarter, I started having a few issues with it, these being,1. I was frequently confused about the person who was replying to Helene's letters - I got mixing up the workers in the quaint bookshop2. The letters started seeming monotonous, with Helen either happy or berating Mark and Co for the books they send/didn't send3. Helene ordering books from London which had to be shipped to New York didn't make sense. What about the shipping charges? If she were a rich, eccentric collector of British editions, I would understand. But she often stated that she was not rich.4. The tone of the letters were a bit eccentric. I understand writing like that to close friends, but writing in a breezy manner, that too a business letter for the first time didn;t sit well with me.5. I found mention of all the pounds, pennies, shillings and dollars boring as I had no means of converting those to rupees, and then again accounting for the inflation values then and now5. Mine and Helene's viewpoints didn't match on many things, notable ones being:- she preferred only non fiction, whereas I preferred fiction- for all her book love, she says she doesnt believe in keeping books, and that she did spring cleaning and even threw away unwanted books into the waste paper basket. This shocked meAnd what mattered to me and Helene was:1. Love for books2. The urge to possess new booksI loved reading about the slowly budding friendship between the slightly eccentric American seeker and the stiff upper lip sort of British providers of books.I liked all the workers. I envied them their shop. I wish I had something like Mark and Co. to look forward to. But so far, the bookstores I have visited have been highly impersonal.I so long for a bookshop near my home, whose owner/proprietor becomes a close friend and allows me to haunt it for hours together.I loved the pictures peppered here and there.I almost cried when(view spoiler)[ Frank Doyle died, and the bookshop got demolished.(hide spoiler)]
