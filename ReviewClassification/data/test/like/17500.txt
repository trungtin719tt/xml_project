A profoundly moving bookWow! What a journey inward, this book really asks you to take a look at yourself and the world around you and appreciate each moment. I am not a huge fan of self help or spiritual books but this one is different. You don't feel like you are being force-fed to drastically change your life, it's more of an understanding about who you are and what you want in life that propels this book. The language is easy to read and digest and you often find yourself questioning and thinking about the importance your own self-worth and those around you. I would recomend reading this book to anyone who feels like they have strayed from the path of happiness, the book is insightful, delightful, and eye opening! A must read!!!!
