The very firstDiscworldnovel. The one it all began with.I've been a fan of Sir Terry's for a long time. I've even read a few other of his books (some standalone, some of the Fairy Tales or later volumes of this series) and loved them all.Fans have given me two pieces of advice ever since I first heard ofDiscworld:1) Stay away from the first 3 books!2) Read them all! What are you, a savage?!*lol* You can see how this made me undecided for the longest time.Thus, I did what every self-respected bookworm with no idea what to do would do - I let the matter rest and, in time, watched a few of the movies first. Bwahahahahaha!The movies weren't bad at all despite apparently never having had the appropriate budget and I found myself wishing for more.All the while I collected the books (I'm very particular about the covers/editions), magnets, bookmarks, postcards, original art, pins and "science books" about the Discworld.And then Sir Terry died.Even while writing this my eyes water. It was, if you believe it or not, another reason to put off reading the books.In the meantime, I've collected all of the volumes I wanted (DEATH, witches, Tiffany and more) and have the others as ebooks/audiobooks, but it was time to finally start reading the series so when we talked about just that in the group, I had no further excuses.This volume introduces readers to the Discworld that stands on the backs of four elephants which in turn stand on the shell of the great turtle Great A'Tuin that floats through space.Science as we know it doesn't apply here as gods are real, so is magic, and many things exist solely because people believe in them.It is about a wiz(z)ard named Rincewind and his adventure (or at least the first half of it) with Twoflower, a visitor from the counterweight continent. Twoflower being the very first tourist means a lot of miscommunication (people in Ankh-Morpork, where he lands first, don't know what glasses are for example). This gives the author the great opportunity to mock tourism in general with people experiencing foreign places through the lenses of their "picture boxes", speaking in not really helpful sentences out of dictionaries. Interpsersed we get funny takes on insurance (utterly unheard of in Ankh-Morpork) and the whole "hero" business then and later in the book.Rincewind, one must admit, isn't exactly the greatest of wizards, but his quirky way is endearing.He and Twoflower travel from Ankh-Morpork to Quirm (or at least towards it), Wyrmberg, and even the Edge where they meet the people of Krull. They stumble from one catastrophe into the next, all the while being unaware that their encounters are actually caused by gods (they are pieces on one of their board games).This means that the reader gets to see a number of corners of this unique world that so perfectly mirrors the craziness of our own. We even get an overlapping when Rincewind calls a plane from our world to save himself and Twoflower. *lol*One comment about Rincewind. Not sure what Sir Terry intended (he had a cameo in the movie so he must have known about the interpretation of Rincewind for the screen) but he seems to be younger in the books than in the movie.Book Rincewind on covers:Movie Rincewind (right):And yes, the actor reminds me a bit of a male Maggie Smith with his gestures and facial expressions (he is as cynical and grumpy as the Dowager Countess Grantham after all).The story then concludes with a quite literal cliffhanger (bad play of word, I know) and picks up immediately at the start of the next book so technically they belong together.Now, for the actual impression.I can see why many have told me not to start the series with the first book. I am a completist and I like to read in chronological order even if it might not be 100% necessary. So doing this was the right choice. That being said, I have to admit that some spins on ideas the author played with in this were ... not too original and therefore not too funny. Sure, I enjoyed the "Big Bang" joke right at the beginning and loved the cynical view on many things, but overall it really could have been sharper.Moreover, and this is my fault alone, many stabs at classic fantasy bits were (if not completely then at least to some degree) lost on me. Sure, I got the parody of heroes and stuff, but none of that was laughing-out-loud material. Yes, it almost sounds like blasphemy, but it is obvious how old the book is, in what early stages Sir Terry still was and yet - and YET - you can already see and feel the greatness poking through with a dagger (Assassin's Guild style)!P.S.: For anyone wondering, luggage really was a fantastic character and I expect it to be at least this good in the next too.
