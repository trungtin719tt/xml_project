5 stars.A broke college dropout pretends to choke on food in restaurants to scam people into paying him so he can afford to keep his demented mother in a treatment center. Even the blurb sounds like.. well it sounds like a Palahniuk novel.Told in short chapters alternating between past and present we meet Victor, a sexaholic who goes to 12 step meetings only to score more chicks and works in a history re-enactment theme park which he finds utterly stupid. We get a glimpse at his childhood, how his mother ditched him and came back to fetch him from time to time to take him on adventures. He hopes to find out who is his real dad while his mother is still alive, and he meets a pretty doctor who just might be able to help him out.Many times I found myself laughing out loud in the beginning, the easily flowing storyline pulled me in immediately and managed to cover up the nasty truth for a while: in this novel everyone is desperately lonely and lost, trying to find something to cling to while navigating the bleakness of everyday life. Soon that sense of ease turned into something suffocating leaving me with knots in my stomach till the very end.I think the brilliance in Palahniuk's books is that while the prose is rather simple, often vulgar and incredibly witty, dictating and insane pace he is still able to craft a meaningful story with nicely fleshed out characters. He's still able to tell the reader some valuable things about addiction, perversions, the complexity of parent-child relationships, loneliness, the hypocrisy of our society and about how it feels when one's life doesn't turn out as expected.Definitely worth reading.
