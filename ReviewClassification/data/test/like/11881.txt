Wow! I really, really liked this book! I don't know why it took me so long to start reading them, but I can tell you that once you start....you don't want to stop!If you want an action packed vampire/ghost read with a couple of HOT roommates(Shane and Michael) than this book is it. I also need to mention the other roommate, Eve, who likes the whole Goth thing.Claire Danvers is enrolled in college rearly due to her academic achievements. She's 16, nearly 17 which she likes to remind people. Her first day of school and she already has gotten herself on the bad side of a nasty, mean girl named Morgan (and let me tell you, her character is so well written it makes you want to jump in the book and kick her butt yourself!).Claire decides she can't live in the dorms for fear Morgan and her posse will end up killing her so she seeks out a roommate add. Upon her arrival at the Glass House, she meets her said roommates Shane, Michael and Eve.Life starts to get real complicated being in Morganville and the people in the town are on the creapy side. Our protag. Claire, is a smart and determined little thing and she finds that life is nothing what it seems. She is faced with the ugly truth about life in Morganville and with the help of her new roommates they battle together to stay alive.The writing was easy to follow and didn't lead you astray. It keeps you in suspense and the story line flows so you get pulled into it. I just love the characters, even the secondary characters. Claire is awesome but I have to say, her two male roommates keep your toes warm.Maybe it's a good thing I jumped on the Morganville band wagon late...now I get to read them consecutively!!
