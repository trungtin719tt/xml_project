"I am glad you are here with me. Here at the end of all things"Here I am, at the end of my third re-read of the Lord Of The Rings trilogy. I always feel sad when I get to the end of this masterpiece, whether it be the book or the film. I just never want it to end.Tolkien created this beautiful, enchanting world called Middle Earth, which is full of magic and has had the ability to capture our hearts. I would never have believed, many years ago, when I first introduced to Tolkien, that it would have such a profound effect on me as a person. In my eyes, Tolkien IS the Lord of classic literature."All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king"I think this book is by far the best, as it is so intense and emotional, and holds the most greatest battles in true Tolkien style.Now really, once you finish this, all that you can do is weep because it's over!I have so much love for this book.
