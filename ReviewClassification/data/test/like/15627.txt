This is a love story. A beautiful kaleidoscope of a love story that brings two unlikely characters together: a modern-day princess and an outlaw (or terrorist, depending on whom you ask), and rotates in colorful pieces of activism, pyramids, cigarette packaging, red-headedness, and of course, the catalyst for a love story--sex. These elements weave together to reveal the answer to the questions "how do you make love stay?"Robbins' lyrical prose yearns to be read aloud. The beauty of his phrasing contrasts with his crass content (for example, the princess's nanny becomes addicted to cocaine), and gives the reader the sense that in the "last quarter of the twentieth century" worlds are colliding to have something monumental happen. A force (perhaps the moon?...the moon is discussed in great length as a form of natural birth control) brings the couple together and they fall quickly in to love and lust. These scenes are balanced with sensuality, romance, and with a skillful amount of erotic vulgarity that echo Robbins' common thread of beauty and baseness. This careful execution gives the reader a sense that the love scene never really ended, but rather ebbs and flows throughout the entire story, for an effect of unrequited love and intense longing.At one point, our protagonists are separated and the princess locks herself in herself in her attic. Here Robbins employs one of my favorite devices: the obsessive analysis of a pack a Camel cigarettes. The symbolism of pyramids, camels, and package design are discussed. The seemly insignificant details reveal a rich inter-connectedness in the universe that the reader will want to believe in.Upon completion, I wanted to read the book again. I suspect there will new insights the second time around, which to me, is the mark of a good book.
