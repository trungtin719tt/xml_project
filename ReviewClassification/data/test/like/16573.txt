I am possibly one of the only people who hasn't read Rebel Belle so I didn't know how amazing Rachel Hawkins was at writing! There is nothing extremely spectacular about her writing there aren't really intricate profound quotes and there aren't any special qualities that set her apart like poetry prose or anything of the sort, but all of that is why her writing is so great. She took a very plain storyline, something done before, and made it incredibly unique and beautiful because it was so real.For instance, her characters were so perfect. Sophie was everything you would expect her to be given her situation. She was a giving caring character who was also definitely selfish and she second guessed herself and others all the time, all the while giving chances to the underdog. She is in reality a well rounded character that I could see existing in the world and that's so rare.Besides the supernatural beings, this was a very realistic book. They go to classes, they sometimes suck at classes, she got detention, there was a cute boy with a girlfriend who happened to be the mean girl. It was basically the supernatural version of mean girls if they had been at a boarding school and I loved it.So simple. This is not a book that you spend 100 days trying to get over, this isn't a book that you can't stop thinking about, but it's a really good fun book to immerse yourself in for a few hours. Really enjoyed it.
