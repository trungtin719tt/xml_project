I loved this book! Oh! I'm going to miss Heath soooooooooo much! I absolutly loooooooooooooooooooooove Stark! And seriously it's about time she dumped Erik. I love Aphridite and Darius, they're prefect for each other. I understand Zoey's delema, but her loving Kalona is really upseting Stark which I'm not okay with so she really needs to snap out of it. Stevie Rae is getting old, I don't really like her character anymore. But this is currently my favorite series. I'm not sure how I feel about all the third person point of views but I know that I like it better from Zoey's, even though getting to hear from Aphridite was nice. Did anyone else notice all the typing errors? One of Zoey's parts were told from Zoey's thrid person point of view instead of her first person like the rest also. Maybe they were really trying for the deadline. I can't wait until Burned!
