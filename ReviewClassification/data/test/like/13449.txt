The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress is considered by many to be Heinlein's best novel, an opinion which I don't altogether share, though it may well be Heinlein's best Heinlein novel... if you follow the thread. (I've read it two or three times, and just found out that the audio version is the perfect length for a drive from Tampa to Cincinnati.) In it he explains how to stage a revolution, win a war, communicate with alien species like artificial intelligences and women, organize and run a government and a society and a culture and an economy in a hostile environment, and quite a bit more. His take on socialism and Libertarianism is quite convincing, and despite -long- stretches of philosophizing and theorizing he keeps the story to the forefront, crackling along throughout. I grew a bit impatient with the faux-Russian accent the performer employed in this audio rendition, but that didn't detract too much from the story. Some of his assertions seem to contradict each other at times, some of his speculations are perhaps a bit dated, and some of his beliefs are no longer entirely politically correct, but I still believe him to be the best science fiction writer the field ever produced, and this just may well be his best novel.
