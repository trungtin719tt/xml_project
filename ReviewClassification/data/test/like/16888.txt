[Audiobook from OverDrive]I always love the narrations of Dessen books! Especially when she does Jervais' voice. Ahaha!Main Character: It's always refreshing to have a main character who isn't a middle class white girl. Yes, her sister and brother-in-law are definitely better off, but it's nice to hear a perspective that comes from being raised in poverty. That whole, "Do I have enough money?" and wanting to save it in case of an emergency. And even though she goes to the rich kids' school, she finds that people have more layers than just that rich kid facade. Good good good.Ruby isn't a super complex/complicated character. Most of her life has been centered around her mom's wants and needs, so outside of that, she's hung out with potheads and-- surprise!-- pot dealers. So when she returns to those friends one afternoon, it's not a real surprise. Those friends did feel very stereotypically bad, though. It felt like one of those dramatization videos they'd show you in middle school health class about the dangers of drugs. They were all distant and cheating. It definitely made Ruby easier to split from that world, but you'd think someone would complain about her going to a better school and having a better living situation.World: I always love how Dessen leaves easter eggs from other books. A couple of characters from The Truth About Forever show up at Harriet's kiosk! EEP! I think all of her books are set in North Carolina. They never have a super southern feel to them, but always a nice cast of characters.Family: Gotta love the family focus of Dessen's novels. Ruby has to re-adjust to being accountable to family (Cora and Jamie... And Roscoe!) as well as welcoming other people into her world (Nate). I like that there's a juxtaposition happening as she sees how her "family" was, how her family is now, and how it compares to Jamie's gigantic family. There's also talk about abuse, siblings protecting one another, manipulation, Cora's infertility (for most of the book, she's struggling to get pregnant), and the feeling of neglect.The Boy (or, The Romance): Nothing too special there. Poor girl falls for rich (well, supposedly rich) boy. It was sad that the more layers were peeled back, the more sad Nate's story got. I'm glad that it was brought up about being the friend of someone receiving abuse. Ruby struggles with it being that she's lived through similar, but it's still hard for her. That's understandable.Overall, it's a decent book, good story. The characters were easy to get to know.
