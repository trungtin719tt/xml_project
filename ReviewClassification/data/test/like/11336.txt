Ah, the '90's. Bike shorts, slouchy socks with high-top Reeboks, scrunchies, day-glow.Stephanie Plum is a New Jersey '90's girl who is out of work. She finagles her way into working for her cousin who is a bail-bondsman. Her job is to catch this guy who took her virginity and she's known most of her life, and turn him into the police. He was a cop who supposedly shot an unarmed man and he skipped out on his bail. If she catches him, she will get $10,000. And, she is pretty desperate for money. Like, sold-all-of-her-stuff, no-food-to-eat desperate.But, Stephanie is completely out of her league and has no idea what she is doing. This makes for much hilarity as she bumbles and stumbles her way around. She has no trouble finding the guy - Morelli, it's just that she's not exactly sure how to bring him in."He left.""Shit," Ranger said. "Didn't anybody tell you that you were supposed to stop him?""I asked him to come to the police station with me, but he said he didn't want to."Another bark of laughter....Stupid uncooperative bail-jumper!Plus, she is kind of conflicted about him:Catching Morelli would be difficult. And turning him back in to the court would feel mean.Oh, well if it would feelmeanthen you shouldn't do your job.This book was just hilarious. I loved Stephanie, Morelli, Stephanie's family, and all of the side characters. Also, Stephanie has a hamster named Rex. I love him the most! Hamsters are like little furry angels that were sent to make us have cute-explosions.No, no! You're just big-boned. And adorable!I know I'm about 20 years late for this party, but it works out nicely because I've got over 20 books already out that I can binge-read. And, I can't wait for Stephanie to get a cell phone. It's going to rock her world! (How the hell did we ever live without them?)
