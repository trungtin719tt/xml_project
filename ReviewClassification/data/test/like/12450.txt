Lover Avenged was a great entry into the Black Dagger Brotherhood series. The writing was very good this time: the narrative flowed well, the romance was there and the storyline was furthered. The entire story packs a serious emotional punch, you will root for and cry with all of your favorite characters.I don't really review these books because it's too hard for me. I think everyone takes something different from the books in this series but for me I love the stories. I love finding out more about my favorite characters from previous books and falling in love with new ones. J.R. Ward gets serious props for taking a rather negative sounding character like Rhevenge, who we know as a drug dealer, pimp and bruiser and fleshing him out so well that we are rooting completely for him. He was a very three-dimensional character who had done some bad things in his life for good reasons - always to protect those he loves at great cost to himself. He sacrifices a lot for his loved ones and never expects anything back. Ehlena was a worthy mate for Rhev, she was a strong woman who refused to let the challenges in her life bring her down. That is one of the qualities I find most admirable in a person, so she is probably one of my favorite heroines in this series. She puts herself out there for Rhev and comes through for him when he needs it the most.Random thoughts on the book and characters:Wrath and Beth - One of my favorite parts of the book was seeing the growth in their relationship. I love this couple so it was great to see them up close again. Wrath had a lot to come to terms with in this book but was able to make progress with the help of his shellan, who was a rock for him when he needed it the most. Parts of their story brought tears to my eyes because they were so intensely emotional. There some really hot love scenes too!Rhevenge and Ehlena - I love them as a couple. I liked Rhev coming into the book despite what he did, but once I knew even more about him and his devotion to keeping his mother and sister safe I fell in love with him. He was in a bad situation because of his need to care for his females but bore the burden all by himself and did whatever he had to do to keep Bella and his mother from being hurt. He finally found someone for himself when he and Ehlena got together, it was wonderful to see someone care so deeply for him. These two lonely people finally found a safe place and comfort with each other.Rhev and Bella - The last scene was wonderful where he thinks he will always be her Rooster.Ehlena to Rhev - Hilarious line by Ehlena to Rhev: "It's probably quiet because of the ball gags next door" LOL, even though I love V and Jane that line was pretty funny.John Matthew and Xhex - Oh John Matthew, what the heck are you thinking? He needs to grow up and stop acting like a bratty teenager. You don't give up on your loved ones no matter what. Tohr finally reached out to him and I felt John was pretty selfish in his actions. As for the stuff with Xhex, I think he way over-reacted. He has NO clue what Xhex has been through in her life and never really tried to get to know her. He is only thinking about himself and his pity party, not about her. I hope he gets his head out of his rear end in the next book as he searches for her - because she is going to be in a very bad place.George - How cute!Mary - She is a wonderful person and a blessing to her friends. She may not be beautiful outside but she has a wonderful soul. I love how she is always there for the Brotherhood and the other shellans, even willing to listen to the horrors that Z endured despite the cost to herself. I am glad Rhage loves her as much as he does.Payne - That female scares me! Think about a female V - she is going to need to find a very tough guy. I really think she may be a female Brother eventually.Lash - I don't really care for him or the parts with him, but I realize we need to know his motivations and actions because they will affect the Brotherhood in the future.Xhex - Wow that girl is scary with a knife! I must say I do think all rapists and abusers deserve what Grady receieved - but I am a bit blood thirsty. Her history was shown a little bit and it's not pretty. I understand better her reluctance to get with John Matthew given the horrible way her last relationship worked out. I am glad she is a very strong person because she is going to need that strength to make it through the next part of her life.I can't wait for Lover Mine to come out in a year. I would recommend Lover Avenged even for those who were disappointed with the last two books - the romance is there in this one and it is very wonderful. There are other stories going on as well but they compliment the romance rather than overwhelm and detract from it. I laughed and cried as I made my way through this book, it was an amazing read.
