Oh, Ray Bradbury, you've done it again, man. I read Fahrenheit 451 again recently and decided to give this one another read as well. Now I have to read Dandelion Wine again and then read The Martian Chronicles and then basically everything, short stories, whatever. I think you're in my current list of top five favorite authors ever, Ray. You've been there all along, I just haven't really said it out loud or typed it or... yeah.Besides, it's not like it matters anyway. You've got much more prestigious awards and recognition. You don't need some rambling, bearded fartknocker with a Goodreads account to remind you how wonderful you are. But, I just wanted you to know where you stand so that selfishly I could put it out there. That's all.This book is beautiful. Is it a story really? Is it a poem? Could it be written any better? Can I name my next kid Jim Nightshade? These are all important questions.Charles Halloway elevated this book to five stars for me. Gee whiz, I could read an entire book of just Charles Halloway monologues. Every time it was his turn to talk, I automatically slowed down, my eyes taking their time dancing across the words, breathing them in nice and easy. It was like my brain and my eyes had a quick meeting and were all like, "Hey! Halloway's gonna roll on here about death for a paragraph or two. We're gonna relax for a minute and let you soak it in, man. We are your eyes and your brain. Have we ever let you down before?"This book could be read in the month of October, particularly the end of October, for an added bonus of it being Halloween and all. But I would just read it now if I were you and I were reading this review and I hadn't read this book before. I would immediately track down a copy of this and take my time reading it, letting the words pick me up and blow me away like the leaves on a crisp October evening.Wait, first I would read Fahrenheit 451. If you haven't read that book yet, I mean seriously. It's 2017. What have you been doing with your life? So read that. Then, you can come to this one and fall in love all over again. Like, man I loved reading about Guy and all that book burning stuff, and here I am loving this dark carnival story with two boys and a dad and a bunch of dark, scary people. Reading is just so gee darn awesome, isn't it?Happy Halloween. Watch out for the Dark Carnival. Nothing good happens at 3am. Remember that.
