Greek, Roman, and Norse mythologies have affected our modern cultures more than we might like to admit. Those mythologies were used as means to explain the environment in which humankind lived, the natural phenomena they witnessed and the passing of time and seasons.Mythology has catalyzed the emergence of a rich and profound body of artistic works. In fact, this exactly peaked my interest in mythology in the first place. Here are some of my favs:The titan Saturn eats all of his sons in fear of their prophesied rebellion. Zeus, one of his sons, survives and eventually annihilates his father.A portrait of Medusa, anyone who looked at her would turn into stone. She was eventually subdued by the trick of a mirror.The Greek hero Orpheus doesn't accept the fate of his wife's death. He descends into the underworld (the mythical resting place of the dead) and tries to rescue her. The tantalizing music of his lyre succumbs every creature, even the mighty guardians of the underworld.The Sphinx is said to have guarded the entrance to the Greek city of Thebes, and to have asked a riddle of travellers to allow them passage. The riddle was "Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?" Anyone who answered incorrectly would be killed by her. Oedipus solved the riddle.
