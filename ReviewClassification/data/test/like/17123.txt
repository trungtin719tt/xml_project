Nowthisis the kind of literature children of all ages should be reading. The ugly duckling is just ugly. And didn't we all loathe the "Princess and the Pea"? Back then it was just so important to teach our vulnerable young that royalty are so constitutionally different from us - wholly different protoplasm, so delicate, so high maintenance, that they could detect a pea under 100 mattresses. Blech. In this one the Prince tires of waiting for a princess who could detect a pea (no one could - i liked that) so he slips in a bowling ball. That, a real person might feel. A much improved story. But my favorite of all these delicious tales is the title tale - a revision of (i guess?) the Gingerbread Man. "Run, run, as fast as you can. You can't catch me, I'm the --- man". Except no one wants to chase the Stinky Cheese man, much the opposite, making his taunts hilarious. And the accompanying art is just as educationally realist dada. i loved it. i just wish i had a short, young reason to rationalize not giving it away...
