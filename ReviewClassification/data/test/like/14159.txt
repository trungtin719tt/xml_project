I love when I skim through pages of reviews of a book and they are nearly all either 5 stars or one star. Only a really good book produces that range of opinion! This is a really good book.The Sparrowis science fiction with class. It is well written, there is a satisfying amount of science fiction and then there is a whole lot more besides. Russell's greatest talent is in characterisation. I enjoyed every single one of the characters in this book and when I had to put it down and do other things I missed them and could not to wait to pick the book up again. I loved the humour in the early days when Emilio and Anne and George first get together and I nearly cried in the later stages several times.A lot of people comment on the fact that the book is about religion. I suppose it is but not in a way that any particular belief is pushed at the reader. Others find some parts confronting. Again it is just part of the story and the author handles it with great skill.I see there is a sequel. I will be reading it very soon!
