Science fiction, conspiracy theories and some interesting twists make this an enjoyable page-turner. The story follows the convergence of three people's lives and they can barely believe what they're faced with. Lanie Montrose is a famous singer who is fast becoming more famous for her drug and alcohol addiction than her singing. A moment of lucidity makes her decide she's getting herself clean to write another album. When she wakes in a padded room strapped to the bed she questions her sanity and sobriety.Suki Carter is Lanie's psychiatrist and makes her way to her the moment she discovers she's been admitted to a private facility. Suki watched her grandfather die and has questioned whether what she saw at the time was real or a delusion; so much so that it is what made her become a psychiatrist in the first place. When she arrives to see Lanie she's so heavily drugged she's almost comatose and the doctor treating her is recommending hypnosis to investigate past lives.James Sinclair left his home in Scotland as a teenager to get away from his mother's insane conspiracy theories. As an adult he's made a career for himself in the CIA investigating and debunking claims of aliens, UFOs and other weird stories. He receives a journal which contains the same information that his mother had spewed at him his when life but it was found in an old house in America. At the same time he receives a message to say his mother is about to undergo brain surgery. Filled with remorse, he takes the earliest flight he can to get back to see her.This is a riveting and complex story that throws loads of well-known conspiracy tales in amongst the idea that an ancient alien culture that has been hiding people from a raging, vengeful ruler. While Lanie seems to be the pivotal character, Suki is the one I was drawn to most because she's been given a much stronger background and presence than both Lanie and James. I enjoyed all the possibilities this presented and the vivid imagination. You need to be a fan of speculative fiction to enjoy this.Book received in exchange for an honest review.
