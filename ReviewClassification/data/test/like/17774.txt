I tried to describe this book to my husband, and found myself unable to talk about the book without narrating the entire plot, but then backing away from that outline to explain that it wasn't a spoiler because what happens in the book is like the skeleton that the author hangs the depth of the story from.That depth is in the characters and in the modest, yet compelling way the author describes as positive progress the way development can happen and economies can be created out of the will for people to live a better life together, not just for one person, or one family to become wealthy but for a whole community to become a more enjoyable, sustainable place.I loved the narrative voice of the solicitor who's perspective we share as we read of these characters and the mark they made upon the world. A little like the young engineerng manager inNo Highway, this solicitor's way of quietly taking his role seriously and doing a good job at doing his job is part of what makes the rest of the story possible.Imagine if he'd been too busy for his client? or imagine if he hadn't taken the time to figure out the whole story of what was really going on? We, the readers (and the rest of the book's society) would have missed out on quite a bit and been a lot worse off!A great read. In some ways rivalsrichard powers'Gainbut Shute's optimism and belief in his fellow human being makes for much more sympathetic characters!
