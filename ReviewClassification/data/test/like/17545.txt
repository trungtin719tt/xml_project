What the...? If this is supposed to be Rephaim then why does he have a nose? It clearly states in one of the books he has a beak? I'm starting to think this is Kalona. Dang. Hopefully Stevie Rae and Stark get their happy endings and I hope to god that Dallas electrecutes himself. That would just be comica(: I also swear to "Goddess" hehe. That if Zoey hurts Stark by getting involved with other boys I am going to kick her mortal butt. I am sick of how much of a sleeze she is. Heath is dead, The Poet guy is dead, and stupid Eric is out of the picture. Please Ms. Cast! No more guys! Just a healthy relationship between Z and Stark. Kk?
