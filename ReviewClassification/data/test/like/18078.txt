My 2nd reread and a few things to take note.*Leigh Bardugo is ademjin.*All the mediocre YA fantasy that are being released these days need to read this book to know what quality YA fantasy actually is. (I'm feeling petty and I'm in mourning right now, so I had to go there, so leave me alone.)*Though I worship all these characters, Kaz and Inej are my gods.*Finding out this was going to be a trilogy was a blessing, because I felt robbed and deprived by the end of this book. We wanted more and we are getting more.Over and out.------------------------I am not okay. I am in pain. I feel sick. My heart... I need more! I feel deprived!In spite of all this, this book was better than waffles!I'm in awe, to be honest. I'm blown away by how good this book was. What Leigh Bardugo has crafted is nothing short of spectacular. This is definitely going on my all-time favourite list.This duology is more than just a heist story. It's a group of people coming together, who were brought together by this heist, which eventually led to them accepting each other, forming a bond that was stronger than their circumstance, their background, even though the world was set on putting them against one another.It's acceptance. Tolerance. Ingraining in the readers that people are not just black and white, but fluctuate between the two. To not discard certain group of people because society manipulates you to do so. It questioned your morals, values, pushed them and forced you to understand a person first rather than coming to a judgemental conclusion, because of some choices they decided to make.You've no idea what led to them making that choice in the first place.The character development was exquisite. Leigh Bardugo took her time exploring the characters and making the readers feel beyond invested; they became a part of you. When I wasn't reading, my heart and mind were with those characters. They were multi-faceted, had so much substance and background that made them come alive.The world-building was epic and grand. All the plot points felt calculated, smart. I thought at first that they would always get out a tricky situation, just because they could. It's fiction. But that was not the case, neither did the plot points and the scheming read like a cop-out. It was well thought out. It's the way the mind of a genius would work and Kaz Brekker was a fuckin' genius! Or should I say Leigh Bardugo?!And I liked how even though they were put in a box to figure out how to escape an impossible situation, they found a way. They found a solution that worked. They thought outside of that tight-fitting box they were forced into and never gave up.There's strength in that. Something that the reader can take away with them. To know that possibilities are always endless. And to know there's always hope.Leigh Bardugo has blessed the world of literature with these books. I'll be in love with this duology for a long time.
