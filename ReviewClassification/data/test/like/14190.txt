Everything about this book is different from anything I have ever read. It is small and thick (kind of shaped like a bag of cornmeal) however had I not started it at 10 PM, I would most definitely have read it in one sitting. Written in prose that changes shape and font from page to page, it is a terrifying, brilliant, important, tremendously sad story based upon the life of the author's seventeen year old daughter. Unique, seemingly honest and authentic, and a very quick, compulsive read. I'm still shuddering inside. I do not typically do well with trilogies but I will try the next in this series.I'm changing my rating to five for the prose alone. Amazing.
