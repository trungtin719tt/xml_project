There is a whole lot to like in this sprawling family saga that takes us on the journey of the Henry Family from the late 1930's through the bombing of Pearl Harbor and then Clark Field in the Philippines. I had this book on my Kindle for over a year and one day I was talking to the family about the old Mini-Series format from the 70's and 80's (by the way are the 10-episode cable series that dominate todays TV really any different from these? I think not!), and I remembered this show and the book. So I began this almost 900 page book and a lot of things popped out at me. First of all, how horrid the TV casting was of the characters in the book. I know this is a book review, but the mini-series played a big part in why I read this and so I must digress a bit.One thing that I have always read is that TV shows or movies always seem to get the ages wrong on the participants in these historic events. In the book Pug Henry is 49 and his kids are in the early to mid-20's. In the mini-series we have 64-year old Robert Mitchum trying to portray this character and then all the other casting runs from there with actors portraying characters who are all 15-20 years younger than the actor. And who in their right mind would cast Ali McGraw and Jan Michael Vincent in their roles - I know it is always about ratings but these were terrible choices!As for the book, we have Pug Henry who is a 49-year old Navy man who has a wonderful sense of perspective and becomes FDR's eyes and ears to the early stages of WW2. His one son is a fighter pilot and other son eventually becomes a submariner, and a daughter who goes into the entertainment business. Not sure what Madeline Henry really added to the book, but maybe that will become more evident in the sequel "War and Remembrance".Here we get to see the buildup of WW2, the invasion of Poland which was allegedly due to the Poles invasion of Germany - a deliberate faked invasion made up by Hitler - as well as his defensive invasion into Russia. There is a ton of really great history in this book, including portions which give the German point of view and which are very informative and thought provoking.We see the plight of the Jews, the plight of the Russians, the desperate attempts by Churchill and Stalin to get the US into the war, the Lend-Lease program that was approved by a Congress that did not want to supply arms or supplies to England or Russia but who approved this subterfuge, the mixed convictions of the US populace that wished to remain neutral but also which had a great deal of support for helping our Allies.I will also give this to Wouk, he made up some very unlikeable characters: Pug's wife Rhoda who is a flighty flirt who drinks to much and is a spoiled brat worrying about what she will wear to meet Hitler at a reception than the fact that the Jews of Berlin are starving and being dispossessed of their businesses and property, and a woman who loves nothing more than shopping; his son Briny who is just an arrogant and moody person who falls in love with the half-Jewish Natalie Jastrow who herself has few redeeming qualities other than dashing throughout war torn Europe to see her relatives and then having Briny chase after her and continually rescue her; and I could go on for a few others, but Wouk shows that families are made of noble stock like Pug, and son Warren, and then there is the flip side of Rhoda, Briny and Madeline. We follow this crew through all these pages and know that we are slowly going to reach the inevitable climax of Pearl Harbor which sets up the next book that will dwell on the actual time the US is at War with the Axis forces of Germany, Italy and Japan.While this was more of a 4.5 on my scale I rounded the book up because of all the historical research and many of the additional facts that I learned through Wouk's writing. I will take a bit of a break now because the next book in the series is over 1050 pages long on my Kindle and for now the Henry family can blaze away in defense of America and democracy and I will catch up with their saga later.
