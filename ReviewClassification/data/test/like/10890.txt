He was twelve years old and extraordinarily beautiful for his age. His brown hair was long probably too long-but the sea breeze swept it back from a fine, clear brow. He stood thinking of his mother, who was dying, and of friends, both absent and present, and worlds within worlds, turning in their courses.'June 2011 updateThere was going to be a mini-tv series of this but due to funding the studio dropped it.
