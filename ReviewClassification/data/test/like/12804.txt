There are few other writers whose work has lingered in my mind to the same degree as has Borges. His short stories are a metaphysical perfume whose aroma, so startling and heady upon the first inhalation, arises, unbidden, at certain points of thought or recollection, working its peculiar and powerful transformative and transfigurative memes upon the seemingly stolid principles that order our universe.The Library of Babelwrenches the brain like a sudden stop upon a dreamy hexagonal rollercoaster;The Immortal, with its revoltingly abnormal architecture and gibbon men of Homeric lineage, an inky nightmare asleep in the vast, scorched wastes of the desert, haunts tessellated thoughts and turns them to dusty interludes.They exist to be read and reread, magical literary beans that invite whatever Jack dares them to clamber up the stalk their taut text weaves. Andrew Hurley's translations are simply pitch perfect - Yates and Irby would be proud - and to have the entire compendium of icy and precise Escherian sorcery at hand in one tome is a godsend. Thehighestrecommendation.
