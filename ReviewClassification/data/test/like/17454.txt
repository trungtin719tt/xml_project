the first vampire books that I read were from Twilight books and after that whatever I read of them, I read in PNF genre. Needless to say these vampires were good, sexy, killing evil and saving the damsel in distress. Then three years back I readFevre Dream, and that shattered the good image of vampires. Vampires were blood thirsty, scary, dangerous and murderers. I liked this version more than the love sick one and now I prefer this version over the PNF. So I was happy when I finished reading this book as this is how one must write vampire books!Oskar is a 12 year old boy living in suburbs of Sweden. He is bullied regularly by three of this classmates. Other students avoid him and he has no friends. He is alone and this loneliness fills him with plans of revenge. He feels so much rage towards these other guys, he wants to kill them. His evenings are filled with adding newspaper cuttings of brutal murders to his scrapbook. He wants to be a famous murderer. But none of these things happens because he met a girl named Eli. Eli lives next door to him. There is something peculiar about Eli but soon they are friends. But there is someone who is killing people in his town.For most part this book was unpredictable. What I expected never happened and all the time I was on edge because of the suspense. There were other stories too in the book in addition to Oskar and Eli, and I kept thinking how author would converge these stories but he did a wonderful job with them in the end. But there are few parts in the book that were not very good and made the book dull. Also there were few things that author left unexplained.This book is creepy and scary. This book has vampires, pedophiles, drug addiction, alcoholism, dark rooms, violence, murders and abuse. But this book also has friendship, innocence, tenderness, trust, truth, care, concern and love.Highly recommended.
