"What a beautiful world it was once. At least a river of it was."... and what a joy it turned out to be visiting this world under the guidance of Norman Maclean. The joy doesn't ignore the pain and the sadness at the core of the title novella, but acknowledges the treasures buried in the text: a hard won wisdom and serenity and most of all the satisfaction of a job so well done that it becomes a work of art, regardless if it is the capture of a trout with a Bunyan Bug No. 2 Yellow Stone Fly, a well balanced load on the back of a mule, bringing down a tree with a handsaw, or writing a novella that may haunt me for a long, long time. I will steal a word of praise from Annie Proulx, who says it so much better than me in the Foreword to the 25th anniversary edition:There are few books that have the power to put the reader in such a deep trance that the real world falls utterly away. [...] Almost no other author's work reads aloud as well as Maclean's, elegiac, haunting and taut.I believe the explanation of the instant charm these stories have exerted on me can be explained by their long gestation and by the passion for the subject the author has been able to translate into words that flow like his sparkling mountain rivers. Maclean first published these stories in his seventies, but they were born much earlier: in his memories of growing up in Scottish Presbyterian family in Montana, in his first jobs as a logger and as a forest warden, in his years as a teacher of literature, in the stories he told to his children at bedtime or to his coworkers around a campfire. So what we are reading now has been told and retold and polished and distilled down to its essence a long time before it was put down on paper.Even when the writing was finished and the manuscript sent to the publishers, some complained that there were 'too many trees in the story'. Who would be interested in reading such detailed accounts about fly-fishing or camping out in the wilderness? I have seen some (few) reviewers here on Goodreads who share in the sentiment, but I am in the camp who argues that the story was never about fishing. It is about history, and about nature, about working with your hands, it is about family and about friendship, about death and about passing the flame of love to the next generation. Maclean in his own foreword explains a little about the purpose of the text: "that of letting children know what kind of people their parents are or think they are or hope they are."Note the conditional verb to be - to think - to hope. Writing is not a simple act of taking a snapshot of a significant moment in your life. In the retelling, the story gets altered, the facts rearranged to fit around the core ideas, the dialogues streamlined and the revelations explained in a timely manner. Like the good fisherman, the writer chooses his lure carefully, throws the line in the water and then coaxes his catch with a firm hand to the shore (to the moral of the story). Here's the lure, the opening line:"In our family, there was no clear line between religion and fly-fishing"And then Maclean proceeds to elaborate on this point, starting with the father - a Scottish Presbyterian minister who first put a fishing rod in his and his brother's hands and then taught them the Cathehism. Later the focus moves on the adult relationship between brothers, about extended families and the disconnect between generations, about the impossibility of full understanding even between the closest of siblings:You can love completely without complete understanding.The narrator loves his brother Ken more than anything in the world, yet he is not able to reach across and help him when Ken's wildest part (heavy drinking, brawling and whoring) lands him in trouble. Part of the issue is the stoical, dour Scottish ancestry that claims men should be capable of taking care of themselves without crying out for help, part is the need to allow the other person the freedom to live his own life any way it pleases him."Help is giving part of yourself to somebody who comes to accept it willingly and needs it badly."The outcome of the book is not a secret, and revealing that the story ends in tragedy is not a spoiler. The author looks back to that troubled time and exorcises the demons of the past through his writing, hoping the answers that he found will be of more use to the next people that find themselves at a crossroad. Proulx notes that the novel is a memoir, a requiem, an allegory, pointing out both the autobiographical elements and the metaphysical implications of the text. As I already said, it is not at all a novel about fishing. The sport is just the mirror that reflects and points back at the reader the existential questions each and everyone of us asks himself at one point of his/her life. The solitude, the silences and the beauty of the scenery serve a similar role to the one the desert offered to the early saints who retreated there from the crowded civilized places. The wild rivers of Montana are the haven the Macleans retreat to when the going gets tough and their batteries need recharging. The most important passage in the story is probably the description of the river both in technical fishing terms and as a metaphor for life:Fishermen also think of the river as having been made with them partly in mind, and they talk of it as if it had been. They speak of the three parts as a unity and call it "a hole", and the fast rapids they call "the head of the hole" and the big turn they call "the deep blue" or "pool" and the quiet, shallow water below they call "the tail of the hole", which they think is shallow and quiet so that they can have a place to wade across and "try the other side".As the heat mirages on the river in front of me danced with and through each other, I could feel patterns from my own life joining with them. It was here, while waiting for my brother, that I started this story, although, of course, at the time I did not know that stories of life are often more like rivers than books. But I knew a story had begun, perhaps long ago near the sound of water. And I sensed that ahead I would meet someting that would never erode so there would be a sharp turn, deep circles, a deposit, and quietness.Being able to recognize the patterns of your life in a ray of sunlight reflecting on moving water may be the most valuable lesson I was able to extract from the book, but this just one of the levels at which I was able to enjoy the text. The most immediate recognition came from the setting, as I have always been atracted by mountains and the holiday of choice for many years has been escaping the city with a backpack and climbing to the places where the cars and the noise and the regular tourists can't easily get:When we were silent we could hear the pine needles falling like dry leaves.Making the transition from the feelings of awe and peace of mind the mountains have offered time and time again to the thoughts about religion and the meaning of life comes easily when you remove yourself from the stress of modern life.Yet another level of reading the text is the accurate historical account and the scientific observation that is an integral part of recreating the moment of the narrator's last trip together with his father and his brother. When he looks at the majestic alpine valley, Maclean sees also the slow dance of glaciers across millenia, the effects of deforestation, the personal histories of the settlers and their economic outlooks.I know I said the novel was never about fishing, but I come back to my earlier statement and say now that the story is a story about fishing with all the technical details and the moments of joy that the sport offers to the passionate practitioner.He liked beaver dams and he knew how to fish them. So off he went happily to wade in ooze and to get throttled by brush and to fall through loose piles of sticks called beaver dams and to end up with a wreath of seaweed around his neck and a basketful of fish.In a larger sense of the word, 'fishing' is a stand-in for whatever activity you love doing so much that you don't call it work, or hobby or pastime. It becomes what you are in the deepest, most precious and valuable core of your being, it is the answer to how you define your life: a builder, a writer, a dancer, a farmer. When a natural aptitude, a talent for your activity of choice is coupled with your passion, the result is Ken, the brother whose right shoulder becomes larger than his left, whose every movement becomes poetry in motion, the artist whose masterpieces are written and gone in a flash of a thin line moving in rhythm from 12 to 2 o'clock. I sometimes think of myself as an aspirant photographer, so the passage that made the story personal is here:"It was a beautiful stretch of water, either to a fisherman or a photographer, although each would have focused his equipment on a different point."Here is Maclean in his teacher disguise, a fourth ot fifth way of looking at his writing as a textbook for educating a younger generation in how to search for deeper meaning behind the surface images. (All there is to thinking is seeing something noticeable which makes you see something you weren't noticing which makes you see something that isn't even visible.) The stories in the collection are all reminiscences of his youth, but the act of writing was completed after many decades as an English professor and literary critic. First his audience were his children, then his fellows at university seminars, and now the world at large. Yet the narrative voice remains unchanged, confident and humorous and lyrical. The poet is the ultimate and probably the most enduring disguise of the author who listens to the voices of the river that becomes the world:The voices of the subterranean river in the shadows were different from the voices of the sunlit river ahead. In the shadows against the cliff the river was deep and engaged in profundities, circling back on itself now and then to say things over to be sure it had understood itself. But the river ahead came out into the sunny world like a chatterbox, doing its best to be friendly. It bowed to one shore and then to the other so that nothing would feel neglected.Anything that comes after the famous final line of the story ("I am haunted by waters.") would feel superfluous, yet there are two more novellas included in the collection. As I felt loath to part ways with the world Maclean has created, I jumped right into them. Both are chronologically earlier set that the title story, and both share the autobiographical elements, the historical angle of describing a world that has been swallowed my Progress, and the central tenet of doing your job so well that it becomes an art.To all those who work come moments of beauty unseen by the rest of the world.Logging and Pimping and "Your Pal, Jim"describes the logging camps of the early 20th century, when trees where felled by hand with long saws handled by two men. It is a Man's World, of backbreaking work and long months of isolation and harsh humour, a world that toughens you up or destroys you. Like boot camp, it is a rite of passage that equips a young man with the necessary tools to face the larger world, gives him the self-confidence to face up to bullies and the pride in his prowess that would serve later when he moves from physical labour to studying literature. I couldn't help though from being sad at all the forest giants that have been cut down during that period. Replace 'fishing' with 'logging' and we have another iteration of the opening theme, another parable of the talents, another way at looking at life:Nearly all our talk was about logging, because logging was what loggers talked about. They mixed it into everything. For instance, loggers celebrated the Fourth of July - the only sacred holiday in those times except Christmas - by contests in logrolling, sawing, and swinging the ax. Their work was their world."USFS 1919: The Ranger, the Cook, and a Hole in the Sky"is dedicated to United States Forest Service, another school of hard knocks that opened up the mind of a young author. Again we have the scenery (The mountains of Idaho, poems of geology stretching beyond any boundaries and seemingly even beyond the world.), the talented man whose hands knows all the secrets of his trade (Packing is the art of balancing packs and then seeing that they ride evenly - otherwise the animals will have saddle sores in a day or two and be out of business for all or most of the summer.), the isolation, the campfires, the easy camaraderie, the humorous anecdotes, the melancholic tune of a world gone by.By the middle of that summer when I was seventeen I had yet to see myself become part of a story. I had as yet no notion that life every now and then becomes literature - not for long, of course, but long enough to be what we best remember, and often enough so that what we eventually come to mean by life are those moments when life, instead of going sidewys, backwards, forward, or nowhere at all, lines out straight, tense and inevitable, with a complication, climax, and, given some luck, a purgation, as if life has been made and not happened.USFS 1919 is the closest Maclean comes to writing a classic western story, plot driven instead of purely contemplative, as the lone hero embarks on a contest of wills with the Cook, is mentored by the Ranger, mullishly tries to break a record of descending a mountain without drinking any water, picks up a waitress in a bar, and ultimately clears out a town with his buddies in one of the most original and hilarious saloon fights I've ever read. The ruckus is all indirectly described from under a table just by looking at the brawlers' footwear. And when that footwear has inch long steel nails designed for climbing up trees, you know the fighting is bloody serious.If the first story was about family relations, and the second about a boy becoming a man, this last one is about teamwork and friendship. Of course, being a Maclean story, it is also about the joys of working with your hands and getting satisfaction from a job well done:We were a pretty good crew and we did what we had to do andloved the woods without thinking we owned them, and each of us liked to do at least one thing especially well - liked to swing a jackhammer and feel the earth overpowered by dynamite, liked to fight, liked to heal the injuries of horses, liked to handle groceries and tools and tie knots. And nearly all of us liked to work. When you think about it, that's a lot to say about a bunch of men.But the story is also about the Whole in the Sky, the catharsis, the epiphany, the looking beyond appearances, the illumination of your soul that standing on the highest peak after an arduous climb can bring on:It is surprising how much our souls are alike, at least in the presence of mountains. For all of us, mountains turn into images after a short while and the images turn true.This is as good a place as any to stop my review, noting, as others have done before me, that the effort of extracting the meaning through only a few separate quotes is unsatisfactory given the elegance of the presentation and the careful construction of the stories where each step is determined by the one that came before it. Looking at only the bend of the river means ignoring the bigger picture that Maclean planned to the last detail, to the last metaphor and comma. Read the whole set of novellas, they are quite short for the wealth of wisdom and emotion they contain, and please don't stay away because you probably never held a fishing rod in your hand. I'll let the author have the last selling pitch:This, then, in summary, is a collection of Western stories with trees in them for children, experts, scholars, wives of scholars, and scholars who are poets. I hope there are others also who don't mind trees.
