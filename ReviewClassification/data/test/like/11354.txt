***NEW LAWSUIT UPDATE BELOW (6-30-11)...Lone reviewer continues fight with corporateASSCLOWNSpowers in epic 1st Amendment battle royale.***4.0 stars. FULL REVIEW (hopefully) to follow after resolution of thelawsuit* filed against this reviewer in the District Court ofNarniaby, among others:20th CenturyFucksFox,Lucasfilms, theTolkien EstateandRobert Van Winkle(akaVanillaAsshatIce) in order to prevent the release of an allegedly offensivebut in reality just knee-slappingly funnyPARODY review depictingDarth Vader,Gandalf the White,The MOUTH of Sauronand several inebriatedEwokshopped up on "Shire Ale" and "Longbottom Leaf" all playing a naked, sexually explicit game of "ring toss" using oversized versions of theOne Ring; all while singing a re-mix club version ofIce, Ice Baby.I hope to have this matter resolved shortly or at least by the time I come up with something to actually say about the book.***PREVIOUS UPDATE***Discovery is proceeding in the case and this reviewer has requested travel records and receipts from counsel for Darth Vader and several of the Ewoks (now sober) relating to an "incident" that hopefully will not "stay in Vegas" for long. The incident, now being discussed all in chat rooms across the Internet, concerns the Sith Lord's behavior at a recent bachelor party for one of the Imperial staff and may assist in demonstrating that the parody review was not as damaging to Lord Vader's reputation as the complaint alleges. I will keep you posted.....***LATEST UPDATE***The prosecution was dealt a serious blow today when, during cross-examination,Grima Wormtongueadmitted under oath thatIce, Ice Babydid indeed "suck bad enough to pull a softball through a garden hose," seriously undermining the case for damages brought by Robert Van Winkle (akaVanilla Ice). Following today's proceedings, Mr. Van Winkle responded by saying, "Yo, Yo...wetting himself and then walking away looking confused." More on this as it develops....*DISCLAIMER: The lawsuit referenced above is itself a parody.The full review isactually pending...possible in the futureunlikely because the reviewer himself is inebriated on ale and some kind of pipe-weed and thus can not prepare a proper review at this time.
