I admit, I like Terry Pratchett a lot anyway, but "Night Watch" is hands down my favorite Discworld novels (Jingo comes in a distant second). One of the darkest and most complex of the City Watch stories, while pursuing a truly depraved criminal named Carcer, Commander Sir Samuel Vimes is thrown back through time on the eve of the birth of his son to help... well, himself. Ankh-Morpork is on the brink of revolution, and somebody's got to make sure young Sammy doesn't die before his time.But it's so much more than that. The high drama of the story comes from the subtle portrayal, not only of good and evil, but the extremely gray area of civil war, class warfare, the human spirit, and the will to survive. Parodising works like Les Miserables, time travel stories, and Eastern philosophy, Pratchett draws on a rich tapestry of history, from the English Civil War to the bloody French Revolution to paint a sometimes comical, sometimes tragic, always wry but never detached story of what happens when you get a split the trousers of time, deftly handling a time paradox and complex issues of destiny, fate, fellowship in adversity, faith, fidelity, and the morality and importance of our choices, the last being a Sam Vimes theme that is carefully developed and explored through later Discworld books.As a bonus, this story also features the teenaged Havelock Vetinari, in a rare portrait of the young tyrant before his time, in a fascinating cameo that adds yet another layer of texture to this complex tapestry of drama in the best possible sense, written with all of Pratchett's sensibilities and ironies in the world quite like ours, only... not.
