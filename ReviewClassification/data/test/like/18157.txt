Another great read by the lateMichael Crichton. I always feel a little smarter after having read one of his novels because of his writing approach and how he offers nuggets of factual information. These factual nuggets are what makes his novels so popular. They are well-researched and laid out in a way that isn't intimidating to the reader.I was extremely excited that this turned out to be an adventure story wrapped up in pretty science-fiction wrapping paper, topped of historical fiction as it's bow. A Sheldon Cooper-esque scientist and his secret team have discovered and made possible multiverse travel. But of course, things go horribly wrong when Professor Johnston sends back a message to the future stating that he needs help. His research students find the note and are whisked away to the top secret lab where this super secret new technology is stationed.What I enjoyed most about this novel was it's pace. There's really no slowing down in this novel. Crichton manages to step on the gas and never take his foot off. This may be the reason why the characters are a little stale but I can forgive him that. I don't read thrillers because I'm interested in how the characters are feeling. I just want action! I recommend this book to anyone who's a fan of historical fiction or science fiction. It's not hardcore science fiction but it's definitely a great approach for anyone who's new to the genre. I look forward to reading the rest of his novels.
