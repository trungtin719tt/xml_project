If you like Nicolas Sparks, this book is one of his best. Personally, when it comes to one of his stories, I always read the ending first before buying his books. Sure, it's a spoiler but he has stung me too many times by killing off a main character, turning a wonderful love story into a rediculous tragedy that leaves the reader grieving instead of rejoicing. There is enough pain in real life without inflicting it needlessly in a sappy book. I read to escape and find some joy in fantasy. This one ended a bit over-dramatically but it all in all, it ended well; so I bought it.
