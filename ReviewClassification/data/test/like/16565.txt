I've wanted to be a witch forever. Long before anyone uttered the words Harry &amp; Potter. You see, there was this awesome movie called Teen Witch. Have you seen it? Well the girl finds out she is witch, turns her little brother into a dog, gets to meet a famous singer AND snags the most popular boy at school. All because she had magical powers. I so wanted to be a witch.Perhaps that is why I loved this book so much, or maybe it's because Hex Hall is a laugh-out-load, fast paced and easy read. It could really go either way. The point is, however, that it was marvelous.I've been trying to write this review for days. I'm not sure why I find it so difficult to explain why I find something so enjoyable, but for whatever the reason I do. Ask me why I don't like something, I can write you a list a mile long, but describe why I like it.... I just do that's why!It could be Sophie, the main character. She is just an enjoyable protagonist. She's caring, open-minded, a good friend, and she might be a little gullible at times, but that is what makes her so great. She isn't a perfect character, she makes mistakes and we get to laugh at her for it! Well sometimes.Maybe it was the plot. I will admit at times it was a little predictable, but it was never slow. And I might have thought I knew what was going on, but Hawkin's really threw me for a loop. I'm sure it will leave you craving the next novel as much as I am.Then again it was probably the writing. Simplistic and addicting.I might not be able to vividly express why I thought it was amazing, but it just was. I'm so very much looking forward to the next novel and more of Sophie's adventure.
