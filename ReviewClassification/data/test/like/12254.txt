I know a lot of people don't like Koontz, no clue why, I always enjoyed his stuff. Even his weaker stuff I had some enjoyment. So I picked up one of his most loved books and I have a lot of positives to say about it.I don't like giving a description of things. Because you can see that on Amazon or Goodreads. I like to get into the good and bad. So real fast the basic idea is Travis, our main character, stumbles on a dog who is extremely smart. We're talking human level smart. However "The other" a creature of evil is hunting the dog. This starts a pretty interesting thriller.I loved Einstein (he's the dog) he's both lovable and brave and awesome and I want one so bad...I already have 3 dogs, so that says a lot. I also enjoyed Travis and Nora, both well made character who stay interesting throughout. Travis is especially nice to see, a broken character, fix himself. Nora similar. I really enjoyed Lem too, who's the detective from the FBI put on to this case. His story is solid and you get to see the bigger scope and background to Einstein.The negative really comes down to Vince. He's the assassin of this story. He's hired by the Russians to murder the people who worked on the project with Einstein and "The Other" and it's just not all that interesting. Yes a cold blooded killer could be fun to read. He is not, and he's flat, and yeah...he takes up maybe 15-20 percent, but that's a good portion.The book is a fast, easy, fun read. I had a great time listening (It was audio book) and def recommend this one. It's the third best book I've read from Dean and worth your time if you like thrillers.
