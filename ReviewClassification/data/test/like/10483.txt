I expected to be disappointed with this but I wasn't. Not even one bit!!! And I'm screaming because Rhage is my favorite brother and hell yes his book was freaking great. I admit I had a love/hate relationship with Mary, but my intense love for Rhage and the fact that I binge read this in less than 24 hours (I stayed till 3 am to finish this, gosh, I regret my life choices) makes me ignore Mary.NOW GIVE ME ZSADIST'S BOOK. I ABSOLUTELY CAN'T WAIT.
