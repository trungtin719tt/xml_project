UPDATE: 99 cents on Kindle US 5/19/19www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comI loved this book. I felt sorry for these kids that had to go through this stuff. Most often, at the age of 10, all of the children would develop abilities and the majority of their parents would send them off to camps. Instead of helping the children manage these abilities, the camp either kept them around forever, or they killed certain ones.At these camps the children were labeled with colors with, red and orange being the most dangerous and pretty much killed right off the bat. I'm sure if they did the right thing and tried to help them with these abilities there would still be some evil kids, but that's life.Some of the kids get away or they hide when they start to develop their powers. It's a pretty sad existence.Ruby is one of the children taken away after her parents called for her to be picked up. She was in the camp at Thurmond from age 10 through age 16 when she was broken out by a so called good team of grown-ups. I'm not sure about these people yet as you know how adults are!They make a pit stop and Ruby spots a little girl scavenging for food. She follows her and ends up with this little rag tag team of kids who are trying to get to a sort of safe haven. The little girl is named Zu and the other two are Chubs and Liam. I loved Zu and Liam right off the bat, you have to learn to like ole Chubs, he's a little cranky. I would probably be just like him, but worse!Ruby is hiding the color she truly is from the other kids. She's afraid they will want to get rid of her. She wants to meet the other kid at the safe haven that is just like her.These poor kids have bounty hunters, guards from the camps and those people from the other place after them. That's a lot of people to have to hide from! Needless to say some major stuff goes down and they end up finding out who Ruby really is as she has to use her powers to help save them.They finally make it to camp and find out the other kid is leading the group. Anddddddd.... it's not all that it's cracked up to be.The ending makes me mad and I hope it turns out ok in the next book. I probably shouldn't hope for anything good, half the time it's something bad!!Overall, I think it's a great book and I really enjoyed it!
