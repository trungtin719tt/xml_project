Just as I had predicted when I first picked up this book, I loved it. This was one of those thrillers that even though it had been written quite a number of years before it still stands up today. As I work my way through reading John Grisham's novels, this being the latest read, this is one of my favourites so far. It is one of those thrillers that, for me, was not fast paced or massively action backed but more laid back but full of twists and turns. This more laid back thriller style matched perfectly with what was happening in the story and certainly made me sit back, relax and enjoy the ride, taking as long as I wanted with no need to hurry along.I have to say that with this novel it is better to go into this not really knowing a great deal, only knowing the basics such as there is a trial and the jury is the main focus of it. You certainly have a very small handful of main characters and a handful of other characters that form the 'background' to what is happening. Even though I suspected what was going on, I still was rooting for a lot of the characters, even though maybe you were not supposed to!A slow paced thriller with twists and turns all the way through you won't want to miss...For more reviews, please check out the link below:Debra's Book CafeDebs :-)
