Couldn't initially get into this but have to admit that Zorba did grow on me and I ended up enjoying the novel immensely.So much to reflect on here, Zorba's joie de vivre was infectious and shone throughout the novel. It wasn't not all light and happiness though there were moments of great tragedy and poignancy. It was also a story of friendship, humour and zest for life.The setting of Crete was a wonderful backdrop to the novel. Finished reading not long ago and had a sudden yearning for wine, warm bread, olives and oranges. A novel to be savoured.
