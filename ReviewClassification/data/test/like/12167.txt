This was a delightful read with even more delightful characters. The story line was engaging, the characters were perfectly flawed, and the ending offered closure without confusion or making up your mind for you. It was a quick read, completely worthy of the Newberry Medal and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good summer read.
