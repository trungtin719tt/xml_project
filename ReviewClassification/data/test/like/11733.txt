One thing I can say for sure is Jitterbug Perfume is nothing like anything I have read so far. This is my first Robbins so I don't know what his other novels are like, but we're talking about an exceptionally charismatic writer here.Robbins takes a bunch of ingredients totally unrelated to one another and makes a story that's as unique as it is brilliant. Beets, horny gods, perfumes, ancient and modern history, eternal life, philosophy and sex. Not the cheesy, romantic kind of sex, but the raw, primitive and full of body fluids one. These are the basic ingredients that he uses to make a story both unforgettable and dreamy.History-wise, Robbins has certainly done his homework. It seems like he knows what he talks about when it comes to ancient and medieval times. The icing on the cake was the masterful use of humor to communicate his rather heretic ideas about pretty much everything. And of course his depiction of the afterlife is simply genius.To make a long story short, this is great stuff which I'll definitely be checking out more of.
