Wow this book..can't express the feelings during my reading of this, so enthralling, captivating but oh the horrors! Unimaginable horrors. Tore my heart out into a million pieces. I regret not having read this earlier, this is a true account of Elie Wiesel as a young Jewish boy who has no foreseeable knowledge and understanding of what was around the corner when his family are forced to flee from their home in Romania, and the unknown horrors that awaited them. Even though I've read and have studied many of these stories of the Holocaust and of the concentration camps in Auschwitz, I was still surprised how shocked I was by the atrocities and how it was written made me shed so many more tears and emotions that I didn't know could still exist. This book is a must read and deserves it's nobel peace prize. I felt so connected to the story and to Elie that I had trouble sleeping. What a tragedy it is to have lost this true humanitarian treasure last year and will forever be grateful that this book and others like this exist. Thank you sir I hope you find your peace in heaven and find your family again. 5 tear soaked stars
