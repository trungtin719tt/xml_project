A book this large, in translation, and covering this many years is bound to be difficult for some to get through, but it is incredibly rewarding. An entire civilization from beginning to end (about 1,000 years worth) is contained through short glimpses of those who were chosen to keep the record from generation to generation. Each writer has a different voice, journaling what they have witnessed in wars, politics, exploration, and most importantly, religion. The overarching theme of the work is a love and devotion to God and Jesus Christ, who reveals himself to them to confirm the beliefs they had clung to for centuries. It is a quite remarkable work and has left a serious imprint on my mind and heart. I am rereading it again (I think for the 11th time), and it never ceases to speak truth to my soul and increase my love for the generations before ours.
