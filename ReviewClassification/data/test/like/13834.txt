There are some single/non-series in Discworld novels, that not included in Watch, Rincewind, or other sub-series in Discworld. In my opinionSmall Godsis the BEST single Discworld novel. With single novel, the character growth aspect is more significant than the series.The main premise of this novel is the relationships between gods, believers, and organized religion. Oh yeah, with that kind of premise, you can find some philosophical witty and wise words here and there on novel.My favourite aspect of this novel that made me rated this book as 5 star: conflicts between main protagonist and antagonist. Without much spoiler, in my opinion the conflict is unique, and as far as I know the author did not use similar plots in author's other stories.
