Wow. I feel likeI. just. can't. get. enough. of. this. world.As I was travelling through Nevernever, followingAshMeghan's steps, my wonder nevereverfaded. My dear friends who took part in Chelsea's birthday's buddy read can attest how much I got lost in this outstanding world, my heartachingto come back there.I fell in love with every single character I met, from this yawning, infuriating and hilarious Grimalkin to the giant spiders who... Wait, no. I'll follow Meghan on this :"I could handle goblins and bogeymen and evil, flesh-eating horses, but giant freaking spiders? That's where I drew the line"I couldn't agree more.What? Have you seen their legs?Are you ready to go? Yes? Okay then."Now, listen. Whatever you see in there, don't buy anything, don't offer anything, and don't accept anything, no matter how much you want it. The vendors will try to make a deal with you - ignore them. Keep silent, and keep your eyes on me. Got it?"Julie Kagawa's writing manages to describe perfectly every single creature we meet, making themfleshed out, so much that I could totally see them jumping out the page and appear in my living-roomfor real."An ancient gnome stared up at me, her face wrinkled and shriveled like a valnut under a frayed clump of white hair. Barely two feet tall, dressed in a once-white robe with tiny gold glasses on the end of her nose, she glared at me like a furious midget bear, black eyes snapping with irritation."As the characters, none of the different settings are rushed : from Queen Mab's palace to theBetween, via the High-School, all the places are filled with tiny details which let the world literallyappearin front of our wide-eyed eyes.That says it all. Grimalkin, remember?"How do you know your way around this place, Grim?"Grimalkin blinked. "I am a cat," he said, and vanished down one of the tunnels."RememberAsh? Yeah? That icy Prince I decided tonotramble about in my review ofThe Iron King? If I thought he won me in that first book, that's nothing in comparison to the way I felt and fell for him in that one. Forget all the broody and wounded male-lead you know : none of them can beat him. Seriously : It took him onlyoneapparition to warm my heart and send a flutter of emotions through me like crazy.Well, I can ramble and ramble over and over again about him, but it'd be completely useless : just keep in mind thathe's loyal, heart-breaking, courageous, selfless - he'sperfection- but thegoodkind of perfection, that is to say, the perfect imperfection(and no, the fact he's hot isn't even taken into account).Again, theplotwas well-wrapped and the story fast-paced, and we're reading as in a run, never resting, always captivated, gasping, sometimes frightened, always mesmerized.Oh, and by the way,I like Meghan. Yes she shares many personality traits with other young-adults heroines and yes I could have been annoyed at some point but you know what? I never was. I understand her, I can relate to her (throwing rocks? I could totally do that), I'm proud of her. That's all."Make your choice."Ash looked at me. I saw pain in his eyes, and a little regret, but they shone with such emotion I felt breathless. "I already have."Edit: Okay, so after some remarks I got about Meghan I feel the need to add some thoughts : YES, she isn't our kick-ass heroine, and sometimes she makes mistakes, and she's obsessed with Ash, yes. ButCOME.ON. All the people who know me know how much I love a strong and fierce heroine who can fight and all that butit's not Meghan.Why am okay with it? Because she's our average teenagerfrom the beginningand her characterization iscoherent. If she had begun to kick everybody's assI'd have foundthisstrange. And for the fact she forgives Ash for his behavior? Come on. Thecontrarywould have maddened me - because that's OBVIOUS that his behavior is necessary. I'm not excusing all her actions but come on, give the girl a break (give me a break about her anyway).I respect other opinions of course and I even understand them. I get it, really.All of this is my opinion and my opinion only.Just please leave your advice in the comment sectionbelow. No need to send messages to say to me that I'm wrong (see what I said earlier? That's only my opinion, just leave it). Thank you all!
