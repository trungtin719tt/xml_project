EDIT: Finally. FINALLY! I was able to finish Pandemonium and oh.my.gosh. The moment all of us have been dreading for.. Ta da!(view spoiler)[Love triangles. Freaking love triangles.(hide spoiler)]Although the full blast will be on the next book :pAnyway Pandemonium is a little bit dragging although it's good that Lena's starting to get strong here.In the romance dept.(view spoiler)[Julian. (I'm not sure if I'm supposed to give away the name so just to be sure ;))(hide spoiler)]He didn't grow on me as much as Alex did. I still prefer Alex, since he's man enough to save Lena(view spoiler)[Unlike Julian who's the one who needs to be saved.(hide spoiler)]Alex died for Lena! She can't just forget that...Pandemonium made me feel what I felt while reading Delirium. Heartbrake.For.Alex.Earlier review:PANDEMONIUM? Okay I'm so excited! Can't wait!! Please Alex, don't die?Pleasy??wait!!! "..and wonders if she may be falling in love again." oh no no no. I hope it's not with another man. =(Lovely cover by the way. &lt;3EDIT: Oh..
