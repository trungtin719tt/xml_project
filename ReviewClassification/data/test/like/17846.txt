This is a book that I would not have picked out for myself to read if it weren't for my mother in-law.The story, set in German in the early 1900's, is about a courageous blond, blue eyed girl named Trudi Montag who just happens to be a dwarf. Over the course of 4 decades, Trudi, tells you the story of her town, her friends, her physical limitations, her jealousy, and most importantly the Hitler reign that sweeps through her town exterminating all Jews and anyone who tries to help them.I enjoyed the story to a point. I was increasing frustrated with Trudi and how she used her size as a weapon as well as a shield. Unfortunately for her, she didn't allow herself pleasure because she didn't think of herself as worthy.This book also raised more awareness and a tenderness for those families who lost lives, who escaped camps, or returned deeply afflicted by Hitler. At one point in the book, the town is returning to "normal" after WWII and Trudi wants to ask people about thier experience though she is urged to "let it go". Trudi says...she doesn't want people to forget this ever happened and by talking about, you keep it alive.It also brought awareness to how the American government closed immigration of Jews to the US when Hitler started reeking havoc. However, Americans came to the rescue AFTER millions of Jews died.It's a part of history that I need to read and remember.PS When the story took on the grave details of Jews disappearing and some details about the death camps, it reminded me of "Snow Falling on Cedars" and how the American's took, um, stole land from the Japanese and sent them to "camps". Hmmm - all this shortly after the shocking news of what Hitler did.
