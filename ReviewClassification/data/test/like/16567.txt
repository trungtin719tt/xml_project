I was so pleasantly surprised by this book, almost as surprised as I am by the fact that I actually decided to read it. I'd all but given up on young adult novels that feature any of the following: vampires, werewolves, witches, shifters, fairies, angels, demons... you get the idea. Young adult fantasy and urban fantasy seems to have been constantly churning out more of the same, butHex Hallreally ticked all the right boxes for me.Granted, a boarding school for witches and whatnot isn't exactly original and it's a hard field to compete in when you're up against the likes ofJ.K.Rowling, but I liked Hawkins' laid back and kind of chick-lit style writing. The novel reminded me of something in betweenVampire Academyand this TV show that I used to love when I was a kid called 'The Worst Witch', maybe I'm wrong but I'd be willing to bet that not many people outside of the UK have heard of it. Anyway, you basically have all you expect from a regular high school: bullies, bitchiness, crushes, dating, school dances, etc. But then you also have the added trouble that comes with supernatural creatures and magical powers: killers on the loose, demons being summoned, bullies that can turn you into a slug...I won't say that I expected to hate it, but I did expect to be bored. I never imagined there would be moments that made me laugh out loud and annoyingly stereotypical bad boys that are actually hot enough to get away with being annoyingly stereotypical bad boys. Yes, you heard me right: another young adult novel with another hot but dangerous male love interest... but this time I completely loved it. Maybe my mid-life crisis came early but I thought Archer was really hot. If I'd been at Hex Hall I know I would have both hated and wanted to be with him at the same time. I think I liked him most because he had a sense of humour and didn't say really stupid cliched phrases like "I'm wrong for you because I'm so badass" - okay, maybe it doesn't quite go like that but I hate literary heroes that believe they're so bad that they've earned the right to apologise for it. Ugh. My point: Archer wasn't like that.The mystery was alright but it wasn't my favourite bit; the novel's strength was in the characters and the dialogue, not in the plot behind it all. Basically: someone died, someone was accused, real culprit was found out... the end. Probably was what stopped me from giving it 5 stars, my full marks demand a better story. But what the heck, it was fun, I enjoyed it a lot, and I now have every intention of readingDemonglass.
