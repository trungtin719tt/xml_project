Kyle Keyes can not only create compelling and unique plots, but he creates characters that draw you into their story, and into their lives, troubles and triumphs. The protagonist of Quantum Roots II, Olan Chapman is a great character, especially since he almost a compilation of people that have come before him, as well as himself. Time is not a straight line for Olan, previously a Vietnam War veteran, he now find himself back in the 19th century as lawless Samuel Leroy McCoy. Follow his new chapter in this fast-paced read, full of action, thrilling twists, and even the odd touch of humor.I would recommend reading the first in the Quantum Roots series before this one, just so you can get the full enjoyment out of this corker of a novel. A must read for fans of novels that don't follow the standard format.
