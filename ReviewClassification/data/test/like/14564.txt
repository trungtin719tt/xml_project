I received this book in the mail (a surprise gift) -- so I read it 'on the spot'.The book is only about 100 pages long --but a charming read (one I'm glad I read).This is an older book (first published in 1970)....The year I graduated High School.The author Helene Hanff, a freelance writer was living in New York City. She spent twenty years corresponding to a used book dealer in London. (they did not do this over the internet). ***SLOW MAIL***!Though never meeting in person, they shared a common love for books.This 'little' book is a collection of the letters between them. I had a lump in my throat! --- This little 'gem' warmed my heart!
