VERY GOOD. This book felt like the boys from Stand by Me had to walk for a long long time and this was the result. I really liked how the boys bonded and acted silly (like 16 year old boys are wont to do) because it felt very genuine. However, this book made me feel bad because I was sitting on the couch reading while they were walking for days and days lol
