I've known about his little gem for so many years, waiting for a special moment to finally dive in. I just love books filled with mementos and letters. I grew up sorting cards and old mail at my grandmother's house to the PostMan Books and now a grown up letter book. Helene Hanff is an American writer desperate to fill her reading dreams with editions of books she has trouble finding in the US. She starts a correspondence with an English bookstore.I ate up this book like a cat with a bowl of cream. Treasured each letter and the friendship that developed. Letters and conversation about books- the beauty of them, the written words, the jokes- this is a book lover's dream. The fact that this is non-fiction makes it all the better. My only complaint was that it was too dang short. I could've kept reading for many many more letters.Updated: just saw the movie and it was equally quaint, bookish, and nostalgic as the movie. 5/20/17
