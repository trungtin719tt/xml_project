I LITERALLY DO NOT KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION OR FEEL RIGHT NOW. I'M GOING TO CRY. SO JUST...UM, STANDBY WITH A MOP AND BUCKET. I'm literally gobsmacked.This book.I'd seen a lot of spoilers beforehand that really made me angry...I HATE having books spoiled! But things panned out differently and even though I knew a few of the deaths, it still broke my heart. I will never ever ever be emotionally okay about this book.I love this trilogy. I love it absolutely fully and wholly because it's a mind game as well as a survival race.Ilovemind games. You never know who's tell the truth. Who's lying. who's good. Who's bad.IS WICKED GOOD?? I've finished the story and I don't even know.I love how this book dealt 99% in grey areas.What does it mean to be on the "Good Guy Side"??? They totally turned it on it's head so so many times. My favourite one? It was definitely(view spoiler)[ that Gally came back as a GOOD GUY. I am so relieved. I loved Gally a lot. (Although that could kiiiind of be because he's adorable.But turned out WICKED was fully controlling him to kill Chuck. And WICKED even controlled Chuck to die. I could cry now. I hate WICKED. But apparently they are still good?!! Igetthat everything they did was to try and save humanity. Which is why I partially find it so fascinating. If you had to kill hundreds of people to save millions....does that make it okay??? So. many. grey. areas.(hide spoiler)]Of course we're missing a lot of characters who died in earlier books but we still have: Thomas (duh), Teresa, Minho, Newt, and Brenda.I'm still not sold on Brenda. I don't think she had a very complex personality. I LOVE NEWT AND MINHO SO MUCH I COULD SCREAM. And Thomas, of course, is my squishily favourite. I love how Thomas makes mistakes but he really really wants to do the right thing. And he's loyal. And I love how he leads but in a subtle way. He never makes the "final decision". He always makes sure Minho and Newt are cool with it. And I love how they stuck together as best they could....I just wish so SO hard that they'd said something about their friendship. I know. NO CHICK FLICK MOMENTS. Gah. Boys. I hate 'em. But it felt always that Thomas neversaid, "Hey, guys thanks for being my best friends and my family." I WANTED THAT IN WORDS.Ineededa little chick flick moment, okay?The action scenes were good and varied.Pretty full on. More guns this time. I wasn't quite as engaged. But I think this is because I knew who would die (dang spoilers on pinterest I accidentally saw) so I kind of felt angry the whole time because I DIDN'T WANT SAID PERSON TO DIE. LEMME CRY ALONE.And I always felt the emotional scenes were...not 100% there. Like the emotion was always trapped behind a wall that we, the readers, didn't get to feel.But I have enough emotion for 58703 people so this was fine.I BASICALLY SCREAMED A FEW TIMES.We gotta talk about the deaths or I'm going to just screech like a wingless banshee.So....tears. And(view spoiler)[ I new Newt would die, but it HURT SO BAD that he wanted Thomas to kill him. I wish there'd been more from Newt and Thomas. Like just...I don't even know! Thomas said Newt was his best friend, but but but I didn't see it so much. I felt Thomas/Minho/Newt were pretty much on equal friendship ground. Except Minho needed to shut his shuck face. HE WAS SO MEAN TO NEWT AT THE END. I cried (on the inside...I am Vulcan) for Newt as he went crazy. I love Newt. I LOVE FREAKING NEWT. And I cried especially hard when he said the reason he had the limp was because he tried to kill himself in the maze. Alby was there for him. ALBY SAVED NEWT IN THE MAZE. He saved Newt from himself. And Thomascouldn'tsave Newt from himself and this just hurt me so so much more. I tell you. The feels were wicked. WICKED.Then Teresa. I was really surprised when she died saving Thomas (she pushed him out of the way of a falling wall) and... it was perfect. I think it proved that, all along, no matter how horrible Teresa's decisions were...at the end of the day she loved Thomas and wanted things to be better. She was never evil. I HAVE INFINITE RESPECT FOR TERESA. She and Thomas are still my ultimate ship because....BECAUSE THEY ARE. I don't like Brenda. I just don't. I will cry for Teresa.(hide spoiler)]The book is perfection.It's fast paced, it's full of twists, and it basically punched me in the feels with the strength of Thor's hammer. IT COULD NOT HAVE BEEN DONE BETTER. I'm sad it's over. It's one of my top favourite dystopian trilogies.HUZZAH FOR THE GENIUS OF JAMES DASHNER!! HUZZAH! HUZZAH!*cries*[image error]
