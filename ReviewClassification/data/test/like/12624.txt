Humans... How little we are. How little we know.Finally I finished this book last night at about 23:00. This is one of the best popular scientific books that I have read. This book is well written, reads like a mystery novel and is a great source of interesting information. Scientific information is explained in "simple reader" language.The focus in this book is on astronomy : how big is our universe, how old it is, how it "works", etc. Sagan pays a lot of attention to stars and galaxies, but also presents the more advanced topics of black holes and pulsars. There are also occasional earthly detours - evolution of life on earth, ancient greeks, the library of Alexandria, voyages of explorers, etc. The book also tries to bring up some philosophical questions, especially in relation to the possibility of other civilizations in the cosmos, and how a contact between us and them would happen.Highly recommendation!==================="The atoms of our bodies are traceable to stars that manufactured them in their cores and exploded these enriched ingredient across our galaxy, billions of years ago. For this reason, we are chemically connected to all molecules on Earth. And we are atomically connected to all atoms in the universe. We are not figuratively, but literaly stardust."-Neil deGrasse Tyson
