"Confidence could only come again now through action so violent that it would make him forget. These were the rhythms of his life: indifference and violence; periods of abstract brooding and periods of intense desire; moments of silence and moments of anger - like water ebbing and flowing from the tug of a far-away, invisible force. Being this way was a need of his as deep as eating."4.5*Bigger Thomas might be the most difficult character I've come across in fiction. Never have a I felt so uncomfortable while reading a work of fiction. Bigger makes one bad decision after another, commits two heinous crimes, literally digs his own grave and yet, he feels like he could not act any other way. Furthermore, Bigger Thomas is inarticulate and so unaware of his own potential. It's painful to read about such a character. Without a doubt, Richard Wright achieved his goal of making the reader come face to face with America's biggest sin. Bigger Thomas can't escape from the horrible crimes he committed, similarly the reader can't turn away from what Wright presents. In general, Wright's writing is accessible, clean and straight to the point. The author created a dozen characters who are all memorable and representative of different values (racism, capitalism, communism...). The book is divided into 3 stages - fear, flight and fate. For me, the opening scene with the rat is one of the most memorable scenes I've read (possibly because I have a super big fear of rats). Highly recommend this book.
