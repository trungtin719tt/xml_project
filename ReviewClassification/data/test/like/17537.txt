In fact, it bored me when I read it. I barely could understand what it was written and often needed a dictionary. But I could better understand Christianity, I understood how marvelously Anne Rice found such an inspiration in religion to write this book. I always get fascinated by authors who show well known things in the other light.Of course it was a very philosophical book, hard to read, but I think it was worth reading. And of course erotic scenes...which I liked very much in the book.This book, in fact, changed all life of Lestat as it is seen in other books. This adventure changed all his life, changed everything in his personality. You must read all Vampire Chronicles to understand what this books means. Everything is connected. In fact this book left some...emptiness. In my opinion it could be continued. The story of Lestat after this adventure could still continue and I see the tragic end or that good old ending."Memnoch the devil" gave me a lot of thinking. Even long time passed after I finished this book, I still come back in my mind and think "what if...". Sometimes my mind wonders in this story and I cannot stop my mind. I think it was the most serious book of Vampire Chronicles. And it inspired me to read more about religion, it inspired me to write one story I still have no plot, not even name, nothing, just an idea.
