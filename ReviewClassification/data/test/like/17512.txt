Thank you to the author and Book Tasters for giving me the opportunity to review this book. I was sent a PDF of this book in exchange for an honest review. This was a sad story and I feel bad about what happened to the author but I like the inspirational message in this book as well. It gives me hope that there are better days ahead.
