WOW! I love this book. I would give it 10 stars if Goodreads allotted it.Exodus is about the Jewish plight out of Cyprus to Palestine and building upon the holy land. More specifically it is about survival in German concentration camps, the evacuation of 300 children from a Cyprus on a container ship - Exodus, and what happened to the Jews once they landed in Palestine. It's about how the British botched protection, how the Arabs hated the Jews and sought revenge at ALL cost, and how the Jews never forgot their faith nor deviated from it.Leon Uris did a fantastic job and telling a story all-the-while staying true to facts of actual occurrences. The story clipped along and not only could I not place the book down, but I couldn't sleep at night. I fell in love with the characters and I developed a thirst for the Jewish history, their faith, and their devotion to the holy land.This book should be required reading for "high school" not a book you read in college or later in life.
