I was told to read this book by my favorite junior and sister when I told her I've got into a relationship and how I feel complete and it's so so so beautiful between us.She asked me to read this book because I am going to find some similarities between the characters in the book, the relationship they had and between my soulmate and me.And I was glad to find out that the similarities, yes, they were there. And I felt really nice after reading this short little book.'Love means never to have to say sorry.'well, my soulmate and I tell each other often sorry but they are such minor matters and the love is always there.Loved this book very much!
