My final read of 2018 and it was a full five stars and a new favourite! I'm looking forward to completing this infamous trilogy but I'm putting it off as I seem to be unable to say goodbye to these beloved characters.On my review forThe Fellowship of the RingI stated that my familiarity with the film acted as a barrier, in some areas, when it differed from these books it was based upon. However, it also helped me to bond with all the many elves and dwarves and hobbits, and it is now impossible to view them as anything other than the beloved actors who play them!
