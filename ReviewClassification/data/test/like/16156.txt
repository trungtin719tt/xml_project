(4.5) Every time someone asks me which Stephen King book I would recommend, I mention this one. After reading quite a few of his books, it's still my favorite!The downward spiral into madness and overall despair were very well written. Reading this book literally made my body ache.I do wish there were a few more details about the world, how the long walk came about, etc.The ending wasn't fully satisfying, as seem to be most endings for SK, but I enjoyed the book anyway.
