I don't think I can talk about this! I'm TRAUMATIZED and in RAPTUROUS ECSTASY...at the same effing time!! I LOATHE this author!!! I ADORE this author!!!! WHAT THE F***ING F**K WAS THAT I JUST READ?!?!Review to come? Huh. I have no d@mn idea. It's a 5-star book. Hell, it may be a 10-star book. It's on my favorites shelf. Do you SEE all the 4 and 5 star reviews?? There's not another freaking thing I could add to what's already been said.Emotionally exhausted. Must sleep. The end.
