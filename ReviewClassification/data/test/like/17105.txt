The story of brothers has always been fascinating to me - I still believe it to be one of the most formative, aggressive, and comforting relationships a person (I suppose I can only speak for males here) can experience. The competitiveness, the constant yearning to impress the other while still holding yourself apart, the simultaneous desire to win the validation of parents over the other, the need to have a friend, an adversary, a...brother - these are all inimitably wrapped up in the fraternal relationship. Having a brother shatters the myth of autonomy - you are deeply shaped by having one or lacking one. It leaves an indelible mark on your character like the pre-historic rain drops that show up on riverbed rocks. Like those hardening rocks, having a brother molds you before you cool and solidify into who you will one day be. And the character that it calcifies lies deep within - somewhere in your basement, someplace subterranean.This relational dynamic makes "A River" what it is. Yes, it is a wonderful tale about fishing. And about family. But most specifically and especially - like stories as old as Cain and Abel and as monumental as "East of Eden - it is a story of brothers.I tried to read this novella slowly. Indeed, I will have to read it again (and again and again...) to grasp more fully what Maclean has given us.Incidentally, I also learned how to be a better angler (though I don't think I'll take up Paul's "shadow casting" technique quite yet). The way he describes how a fisherman should think and react is insightful, but the way he describes the gravity-induced phenomenon of rivers is, to use Reverend Maclean's best word, "beautiful." As Wendell Berry teaches us, "gravity is grace" and every good and perfect gift is "from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights" (quoting James 1:17). Rivers babble this to us every time we step in them.The root conflict in the narrative is simply: how can we help (perhaps "be a keeper of"?) our brother? How does Norman help his wild, debt-laden brother Paul? How can Paul help Norman as he fords a difficult stretch in his marriage? Maclean's answer is singular: fishing. Fishing, because it is more than a past time; it is a link into their childhood and identity. As the opening sentence makes plain, "in our family their was no clear line [pun intended?] between religion and fly fishing." In the end, however, fishing ends up being an insufficient savior for the prodigious Paul. Yet Norman makes Paul immortal through this story - the greatest gift he could still give to his complicated, beloved brother.
