Reread Feb 2018WHAT CAN I SAY I LOVE IT!!! And I can't believe this is like the 5th time I've read this and I still noticed new things.This reread I was really focused on the dynamics between Juliette and Warner and Juliette and Adam. There's so much new stuff I noticed about how Adam drags her down versus how Warner exalts her and builds her confidence. Ugh I love it. Also chapter 62 is still the best chapter of all time and my favorite scene from the whole series is chapter 50 in this book so I was thoroughly clutching my heart the entire timeReread April 2017I have always said that this is my favorite book in the series. Accordingly, I have read it only sparingly, because it gives me so many emotions that it basically inhibits my functionality after I finish it. So why did I pick this up in the middle of the semester? No idea. But returning to this was such a grand 'ol time, especially because it's been nearly 3 years since I've reread it and I was reacquainted with some scenes that I had forgotten even existed.One thing I will say, though, that is sort of breaking my heart, is that I did not have such a reaction to this book that I used to have. I don't know if it's because i'm in college now, if i'm in some weird reading mood, if i needed to have read the series chronologically, but I really felt numb to this entire thing. I remember the last time I read Unravel Me, I had to actually put it down because I was sobbing and it was affecting me so hard that I had to take frequent breaks. This time? I barely batted an eyelash rereading some of my favorite scenes. No butterflies. No breaks.I don't know if this means I'm somehow moving on but this book will always hold a special place in my heart and I love it so much, even if my teenage fangirling tendencies are (apparently) wearing off. I anticipate I'll read Ignite Me when I'm home on Easter break.reread july 2014(giggling at this old review)February 2013WHATI NEED THE SEQUELOH MY GOSH THIS HAD A TWIST ON LIKE EVERY PAGE AND I CANNOT WAAAAAAIT TO SEE HOW SHE RESOLVES EVERYTHING AND WRAPS IT UP AND OH MY FREAKING POOPERSNICKLE GOODNESS TAHEREH MAFI YOU HAVE AMIED YOUR CAREER TO RUIN MY LIFEi need to go lay down
