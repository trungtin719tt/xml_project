I wasn't really sure what to expect from S. Boisvert debut novel ''The awakening''. Aliens, supernatural powers, conspiracy- all in one book. Can it work? Apparently yes. This novel contains a bit of something for everyone. Three main characters, Laine- popstar with a drug problem, Suki- her therapist and James- Laine's childhood friend. Three different people but all of them have special abilities, supernatural power and mysterious genetic connection that need to work side by side to save the world.Overall very good debut. Action, mystery, suspence and romance come together with intensity, stunning description and intriguing charactersin a novel that was a plesure to read.
