Have you ever had your hands on a book that you just couldn't leave alone? A book that you had to have with you at all times, reading it at the dinner table, sneaking peeks at it during work hours? Well, this isn't that book. It took me weeks to read this sucker. It really slowed down my reading pace...at least at first.Stegner can definitely write a good story, and it did not escape my notice that this tale is richly detailed. Stegner knows the West, the stock, the people, the history, and all the associated equipment, and he knows how to describe it. The only thing I couldn't figure out waswhyhe was telling this story in which so little seems to happen...the thoughts of a woman married to a man she eventually comes to scorn, and her haughty observations on the west and its occupants...why not turn your talents to something a little more engaging? It occurred to me that it might be a fairly interesting read if Susan Ward had actually existed, and Stegner happened to be her biographer, but to produce a work of fiction on such mundane topics seemed to be a waste of Stegner's genius. (Subsequent research revealed that Stegner actually had based his story on the letters of Mary Hallock Foote, to the point where he actually copied passages.)Stegner tells a double tale here, with the story of Susan Ward entwined with that of her grandson, an embittered and abandoned amputee who is researching a biography of his grandmother. I found it to be a slow starter, but at the halfway point I actually started to give a damn about the characters and was reading at a gallop by the time I finished. It's a tale of betrayal and abandonment and repressed Victorian desires. It was my first Stegner, but I will probably give him another try later on.
