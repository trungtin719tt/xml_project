When I was in Elementary School I LOVED REDWALL! Redwall was the book that got me into reading when I was a kid. Brain Jacques (pronounced Jakes) was my favorite author. Not only did I love animals (I had a zoo on our front porch consisting of catfish, snakes, crickets, salamanders, two Chinese hamsters, tadpoles, a rabbit, frogs, a snapping turtle, you name it I had it) but I also loved the Medieval Ages, SO put these two loves together and BAM! Redwall!I loved Matthias. He was an awesome character and he became the "bar-set-high" I matched all other characters to. If the book I read wasn't as good as Redwall, I tossed it. The only other series that ranked up there for me as a kid was the Boxcar Children, the Nightwing series, and Harry Potter. (Possibly a few others but I can't think of them atm).Before Brian died, my mother wrote to him thanking him for what he did for me. He sent back a long letter, signed; a picture, signed; and a bookmark, signed. Oh, I was happier than a pig in crap! This only made me love him even more than I already did. When I was a teenager and I heard he died, it was like a family member died. In his honor, I bought every one of his books in hardcover, and I read them all again.Redwall is magic. Pure magic. If you have not read these books you need to. If you are a teacher reading this, take The Little Prince off your list, that you've been reading for ten years in a row, and have your students read Redwall. They will love it!
