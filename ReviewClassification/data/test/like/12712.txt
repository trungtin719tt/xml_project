Come inside!There behind a glass is a real blade of grassbe careful as you pass.Move along! Move along!Come inside, the show's about to startguaranteed to blow your head apartRest assured you'll get your money's worthThe greatest show in Heaven, Hell or Earth.You've got to see the show, it's a dynamo.You've got to see the show, it's rock and roll ....Right before your eyes we pull laughter from the skiesAnd he laughs until he cries then he dies then he diesCome inside the shows about to startGuaranteed to blow your head apartYou gotta see the showIt's a dynamoYou gotta see the showIt's rock and rollSoon the Gypsy Queen in a glaze of VaselineWill perform on guillotineWhat a scene! What a scene!Next upon the stand will you please extend a handto Alexander's Ragtime BandDixie land, Dixie landRoll up! Roll up! Roll up!See the show!Performing on a stool we've a sight to make you droolSeven virgins and a muleKeep it cool. Keep it cool.We would like it to be known the exhibits that were shownwere exclusively our own,All our own. All our own.Come and see the show! Come and see the show! Come and see the show!See the show!******** Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer - Karn Evil 9 Lyrics | MetroLyricsThat happens to be a favorite song. It takes one on a journey of sorts. It creates some good and some horrific images. As does this book. It was funny. Utterly horrific. It's about family. I was not prepared. But what an amazing story. I feel like gushing. I love that it is from a point of view that I never even considered. I could not put this one down. Read the blurb on the back of the book and take a journey into the little known.
