A Cold War book that aged very well. Still, a bit of great American prosperity and "our enlisted men are more skilled than their officers" theme running through the book. A Soviet sub captain makes plans to defect to the US along with his hand-picked officers. He is in the newest and most advanced Soviet submarine that can run almost silent. It is discovered by Petty Officer Jones (our enlisted guy). It's not a thrilling page-turner but a more political chess game between the superpowers and their men. Although the world's three most powerful navies are involved, the military damage is minimal. The Cold War was cold and diplomacy, technology, and behind the scenes maneuvering were the norm. Clancy captured an era with this book.
