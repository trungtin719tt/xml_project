There is a rawness to the stories that Norman Maclean tells in this collection. He lived the stories 30 or 40 years before he wrote them into this book. His writing is poetry, harsh and spare. It reminds me a little bit of Hemingway but with a more refined sense of place. Hemingway seemed to be searching for something or trying to find himself in the places he traveled. Maclean knew who he was and where he was. And where he was is the Montana that many people in other parts of this country think about when they dream of big skies and wide-open places. Maclean writes those experiences in a western-style of prose that captures time, place and humanity so that we, those of us reading his work long after his death, live those times and think maybe Montana is still the Montana of Maclean's youth. Sadly it is not.
