ACHILLES, it reads. And beside it, PATROCLUS.Can anyone please call my boss and let her know I may not go to work for a week or so? I need time to recover from this book thatm u r d e r e d me.No kidding, here. I think getting a Brazilian wax wouldn't have hurt this much.I'm an ugly sobbing mess, running nose and hair pulling included.Wow.What a-wow! I have no words.I can't remember the last time a book made me weep so much.This is the kind of books I like: zero dull moments, fast-paced, character characterization (lol what is this) on point, and stuffed with all the feels and angst a novel is capable of containing.It was wonderful, poetic and the writing was 100/10.If you haven't read it already, please do yourself a favor and give it a try.Goooosh, I'm still shaking.Favorite book of 2017!A huge thanks goes tomy lovely little wafflefor recommending it to me. You were right, I did do love it! &lt;3
