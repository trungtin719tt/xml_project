My 5th Grisham book! The plot held my interest from beginning to end, and was very fast paced. I had seen the movie a while back starring John Cusack, Dustin Hoffman, Gene Hackman, and Rachel Weisz, and the book had kind of the same premise but only the book is about a lawsuit of a Tobacco company, and in the movie it's a gun manufacturer.Some parts of the book were complicated and hard to follow but it still held my interest wondering what would happen next. Highly recommended to anybody who likes a good legal thriller.
