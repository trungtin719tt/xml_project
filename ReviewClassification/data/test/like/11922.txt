It was a completely different experience than reading a chapter or two at a time. I read/listened as part of my Personal Progress for YW.Jan 2015-May 2016 read thoughts:I love this book and the teachings and truths contained within. I have read it many times by myself, with my family as a young child/youth and now several times with my own family. It is another testament of Jesus Christ and helps give us a better understanding of His love, His gospel and His desires for everyone to come unto Him and do as He did, and to ultimately become like Him. I know it's true with every fiber of my being and through the power of the Holy Ghost who has testified of its truthfulness. Every time I read it I learn more and have a greater understanding of God and His Son, Jesus Christ.
