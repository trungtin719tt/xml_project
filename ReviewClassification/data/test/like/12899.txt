Quantum Roots II, by author Kyle Keyes, is the second book following the adventures of Olan Chapman. The book is an exciting sci-fi story filled with mystery, thrilling twists, and violence. The book is a fairly easy read both the writing voice as well as the fast past, action-packed nature of the story itself. I really enjoyed following Olan in this book. He is a super interesting character. He id quirky, strong-willed, and a fighter. The book is different both in the non-linear plot and the odd characters, but I really enjoyed its uniqueness. I will say that the book is pretty graphic so be aware of that going in. I would recommend this book to sci-fi readers!
