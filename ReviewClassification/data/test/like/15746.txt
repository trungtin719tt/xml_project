after reading a lot of extremely well-written books this year and practicing critical reading during the past two semesters, it is strange to reread this favorite and notice that it's actually not that well-written. but i love it and will continue to reread it because it has so much heart and it means so much to me. i am who i am because of matthias the warrior.
