This is a novel by a white male that is highly praised over the decades by other white males. In it, a white male only treats his wife well if she gives back all of the power and stops emasculating him by deigning to have her own life and opinions or (god forbid) expresses a desire for bodily autonomy. He is critical of suburbia because is promotes feminism too much (!) and agrees to have a job when they have children even though he intentionally finds a job that will pay him to do nothing, because this is the privilege of his place in the world.I really can't decide if I love or hate this novel. Is Yates exposing the damaging nature of post-war masculinity? Is he pointing out the impossibilities of female beauty standards? Or is he perpetuating these problems with a complete lack of self-awareness? I mean, this is from 1961. So it's hard for me to tell.The women in this novel are only seen through the eyes of their husbands, and their gazes are hypercritical. Frank feels the need to point out to his wife how bad of an actress she is and frequently takes note of her extra weight since HAVING HIS TWO BABIES. Ugh. His friend in suburbia, on the other hand, is entranced by April and is constantly sexualizing her in his mind, and comparing his frumpy dumpy wife to her. The women are not given internal dialogues or intelligent consideration of anything; they are only doing the right thing when they do what is expected.This, as you might imagine, results in great tragedy... so does the author get it, actually? For now, I'm giving him the benefit of the doubt.Plus the writing has really great moments."The the fight went out of control. It quivered their arms and legs and wrenched their faces into shapes of hatred, it urged them harder and deeper into each other's strongholds and quick chances to switch tactics, feint, and strike again. In the space of a gasp for breath it sent their memories racing back over the years for old weapons to rip the scabs off old wounds; it went on and on."Technically I purchased this novel years ago to represent Connecticut in my attempt to read a book set in every state. So here we go, Connecticut!
