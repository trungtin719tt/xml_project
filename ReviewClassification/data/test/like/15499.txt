Excellent!Reading theUSS INDIANAPOLISa few weeks back brought this poem to my attention beginning with the well-known words......Water, water, everywhere, And all the boards did shrink; Water, water, everywhere, Nor any drop to drink.First published in 1798, I was both delighted and surprised to find where this poem actually begins and takes the reader. It'sreallyquite an amazing journey that may appeal to those who don't even care for poetry.It's aneeriestory with equallyeerieillustrations told by an old sailor(mariner)about a disastrous voyage that begins with a storm that leads them astray until a lucky albatross appears and guides them along to safety....but then the mariner shockingly shoots the albatross and bad luck, bad spirits, slimy legged sea creatures and death result, but that's not where it ends....there's so much more.If you have a little window of time to fit this one in....I highly recommend it! It's easy to understand....and a winner of a classic!
