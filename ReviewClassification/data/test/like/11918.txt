As a young girl of 14, I read this book during a lonely summer. My family and I had just moved from Tennessee, and it was my first summer in Utah. It was a slow summer, since I had only made a few friends. So, I decided to hole up in my room at night, open my windows, and let the sweet desert air blow into my room as I read this book.From that sweet experience, I have a deep love and appreciation for The Book of Mormon. Aside from being a collection of truly fascinating and AMAZING stories, this book is a true testament of Jesus Christ. Through the power of the Holy Ghost, I came to understand the precious truths that stretch throughout the pages of this book. I am forever grateful to the men who recorded their testimonies, their lives, and the lives of their people in this book. I am also moved with deep gratitude for the sacrifices made by many to bring this book into my heart and hands. This book is a true treasure.
