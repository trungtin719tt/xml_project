I resisted reading this book for a long time because the movie is one of my favorites. There were differences that, at first, I found difficult, but I got over that without much effort. Having just struggled through a long difficult read of David Copperfield, this read was smooth and easy and fast.I am a very emotional person and that emotion seems to be more readily let loose now that I admit to getting old. I have always been emotional and have never been shamed by letting others see that emotion. This book caused the tears to flow more than once.Many who read much also write, and I am no exception. I may never get published, because I'm beginning to realize that I really have no burning desire. I write because I enjoy writing. As I read this book, it became clear to me that as I read Nicholas Sparks' words that his style is quite similar to mine. Unless you are one of a handful who have read my story Beach Week.....you'll just have to take my word for that.......mgc
