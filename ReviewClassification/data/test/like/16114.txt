Palahnuik has a formula to his story-writing, and it's becoming more and more clear that every work becomes less and less impressive upon further examination. Every main character seems plagued by the same sense of nihilism and self-defeat like his Fight club protagonist, as well as the same delivery of speech, and thought patterns.So. After reading about 3 books in a row with this consistent formula, I was about ready to abandon my faith in him.But. Then I read this book, and what a fresh breath of air it was. Yes, it applied the formula. Yes, it had the same nihilistic, disenchanted, one-dimensional main character, but it also didn't try to surprise me with the ending like most of his books usually do. (i.e. 'Lullaby', 'Diary', and 'Choke')I truly believe that because of this, the novel was saved from being a duplicate, boring disaster. This book was compelling, albeit slow to start. You really won't feel interested until probably half-way through. But it's well worth the wait.If there's two books you read from this author, I would suggest 'Fight Club', and 'Survivor'. In that order.
