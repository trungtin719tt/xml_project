I read this book in the mid 70's, as a teenager. Then I read it again. And then, a little while later, I saw the film. The three events have subsequently blended into one and I certainly now have difficulty differentiating the book from the film. But that's no big deal as I know the film followed the written narrative pretty closely. It's a true story of one man's battle against injustice and the terrible personal consequences that transpired.It left a big impression on me. It was a big story. A huge adventure which I believed in entirely, though I now know some doubt has subsequently been levelled at the detail. It was also the largest book I'd taken on at this point - by far. Not only did it convince me of the power of a story, it also demonstrated to me that I could be transfixed by a tome so large it seemed impossible it would hold my interest long enough for me to finish it. When I look back to early 'adult' books I've read it's this one that stands out - read as I laid on my bed with a Rod Stewart cassette (Atlantic Crossing) playing in the background.When the film was released I know I doubted it could match the power of the book, but in my memory it came close. I loved Hoffman and McQueen in the lead roles and the scenes of solitary confinement seemed a perfect reflection of what I'd conjured up in my mind.I'm not sure if I'll ever re-visit this tale of a Frenchman shipped off to a prison in French Guiana for a crime he claimed he didn't commit, as I wouldn't want to be disappointed by a second re-read. I think I'll just continue to treasure the untainted memory of my first memorable reading experience.
