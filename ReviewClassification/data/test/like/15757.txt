Another excellent work by a world revered writer. The kernel of the theme here is seemingly encapsulated when the odious Fitch ponders: "Oh the questions he wanted to ask. He d love to start with the two of them and ask whose idea it was, such an ingenious devious plan to study litigation, then follow it across the country then plant oneself on the jury so a deal could be cut for a verdict. It was nothing short of brilliant. He could grill her for hours, maybe days about the specifics but he knew there would be no answers...."But of course the plot cannot be that simple; and we have to wade through this tantalizing work to know the unadorned truth in the end. Typical of his works, the author reveals the sleazy nature of the law and legal practitioners. For example we read: "They did the dirty work that had to be kept to themselves. Most of the other lawyers used runners like Clive to spread cash and chase cases and perform dark little deeds not taught in law school, but none of them would ever admit to such unethical activity..."This steaming work is also about big business, big money, the ruthlessness of the corporate world in certain cases; here the tobacco conglomerates. How well we know here in Africa how the monolithic companies trample those who dare to get in their way! Yet the author clearly pitches his tent with the victims of smoking, as the story peters to an end. Those against smoking carry the day, and it becomes illuminating as we read: "(My parents) were wonderful people...they got hooked on cigarettes when they were in college... They hated themselves for smoking but could never give it up. They died horrible deaths. I watched them suffer and shrivel and gasp for breath until they could not breathe anymore..."
