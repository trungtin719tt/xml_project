Yes, I may be fashionably late to this party, considering the threat of war between Soviet Russia -- which doesn't exist anymore -- and Imperialist America is a major theme of this novel.But I figured this should be my first experience with Tom Clancy, and I do not regret my decision at all. This is a near-perfect political thriller, juggling a dozen major characters on two continents as well as a myriad number of ships -- both on and under the Atlantic Ocean. While it was a bit tricky keeping track of everything at a few points, the minor confusion was well worth the scope of what Clancy achieved.I also loved how I was fooled into thinking a later plot event was a rather weak climax, only to not have yet reached the true climax, which does not disappoint at all(view spoiler)[Underwater submarine torpedo battle!(hide spoiler)].As a side note, when they wanted to make a movie out of this board game:All they had to do was adapt this book again, instead of doing this:But I guess that would have been too easy. Sigh.Update: Okay, maybe I spoke too soon about the theme of this book being outdated. What a difference a year makes.
