I love almost anything by Conroy, but this - in my humble opinion - is his greatest masterpiece. My husband used to read this book to me when we were dating (he in Colorado and I in Athens, GA), and when we ran out of things to talk about, he would read to me about Jack McCall. Conroy tells some beautiful (albeit sometimes, heavy)stories. He paints gorgeous pictures of Italy, South Carolina, and some heartwrenching tales of the life of a man trying to escape his past. My favorite moment in the book, by FAR, is the depiction of Jon-Hardin holding all of his brothers hostage at the top of the Silas Pearlman Bridge (I think that's the right bridge...). I don't want to ruin it for you, but if you ever read it, you can know that that is my favorite part :)
