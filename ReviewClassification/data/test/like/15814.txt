Well, well, well. It's angels again.Angelology is back-breaking work. I have a trunked angel work that I will one day revisit. I've worked too hard to drop it. And I mean that sincerely. I began writing it two years ago, and I am still not finished with the research. I still have stacks and stacks of angel-related references lying around, from fiction to dictionary-format archives, from endless websites to spin-off scripture, from links to Renaissance artwork to holy books. I've read both the Torah and the Bible, and I'm working on the Qur'an. I've watched movie after movie, and not enjoyed any of them. How can I, when I spend the whole two hours writing notes and spotting mythology farts?Perhaps this sounds a huge complaint. I can assure you, it isn't. Research is endless work, but endless fun too. It's learning in its most accessible form. There's no better way to educate yourself than to study topics that fascinate and interest you. It's just good sense.I feel some kind of spiritual connection to this Cynthia Hand. She has her research in the bag. InUnearthly, the mythos and the obviously meticulous research that went into it was what carried it for me. For the most part, at least.The Black Wings, though not entirely how I have formulated them in my mind, were fascinating. Grief and sorrow are perfect emotions to pin on them, and the way they were described was brilliantly creepy. Samjeeza* was a hot-damn fallen angel, no shit or romanticization. His actions, words and appearance struck a chord with me. Basically, he was exemplary, in comparison toFallen's Daniel "The Plank" Grigori orHush, Hush's Patch "Here Boy" Cipriano.*The only reason I'm not thrilled with him being Samjeeza (also known as Shemhazai, Semyaza or Shemyazaz, depending on the context/mythos) is because I have a weird, possessive obsession with him. Like Sammael, he's a big character of mine, and I've grown attached to him. Again, sue me. If I were less grabby and selfish, I'd say that he's the perfect pick for a fallen angel villain in a book dealing with Nephilim, being the leader of the Grigori.Speaking of Nephilim, this is their story told RIGHT. (Again, I'm slightly biased and possessive here, only because I work with Nephilim too). Hers are impossibly beautiful, with strong ties to their angel ancestors. Remember the kids fromTorment? Yeah, they're not like that. They actually get shit done. They also feel like supernatural beings, not just a bunch of pointless Mary-Sues.The thing aboutUnearthly's mythology is that the author is quiet and subtle about it. For example, flies drop down Clara's shirt. Clear satanic symbolism there, foreshadowing the Black Wings. Angela's ties to Italy. Never shoved in your face, but they're there. In many YA angel novels, it's obvious that the author is simply trying to show off about how much they know which, ironically, often ends in epic mythology farts and logic fails. Not so withUnearthly. It's all low-key, but quietly brilliant.The writing was beautiful. Not consistently; the climax was a little sloppy. In one paragraph, for example, we have:1. "I open myeyesand it takes a while for myeyesto adjust to the intense light."Two sentences later:2. "...the light rippling andsparkling off me like a sparkleron the Fourth of July."Sparkling like a sparkler, eh? That's pretty darn sparkly.For the most part, though, the writing is elegant and lovely. The romantic scenes between Clara and Tucker are beautiful, smooth and never clunky. I also LOVE the pacing. Months go by in the space of a paragraph. I like that. It's annoying when a heroine finds true love and best friends and absolution in the space of about three days. Not realistic, and just silly, basically. But no; we see almost a whole year go by throughoutUnearthly. That's cool for me.No, the pacing was not perfect all the time. Large chunks of the book went by, and nothing happened. It started to annoy me, really. Granted, it was all about development; Clara growing into her skin, learning to fly and piecing together the mythos, working out her purpose is (which, to my delight, reminds me of the Focus fromFinal Fantasy XIII).Aside: The purpose is perfect. Truly. That's what YA authors miss about angels; they have a reason for living, and they're not there just to hang around and look pretty. They have a reason and a focus, and this is exactly what Cynthia gave us. Bravo, darling.The climax...well, let's look at this from a logical perspective. Was it well-written? Yes. Not quite as flawless as the rest of the book, but I know how it is. You get all excited writing the climax, you stay up till three a.m., and you're left with tons of typos and repetition that you're way too stoked to comb. So whatever. Anyway. Was it a good, satisfying end? Absolutely. Was it fitting, did it make sense, and did it round off the book nicely? It sure did.So what the hell is my beef?THE POWER OF LOVE, THAT'S WHAT.Me [to Sister]: What the fuck, man? The power of love beats the bad guy? Are you serious? "Love is the answer. LOOOVE." No. Hell to the no. I did not accept this fromHalo, and I shall darn well wax about it inUnearthly.Sister: I'm on the phone!What the hell?Me: *Stomps out of room in a rage*Sister: ...Look, seriously. Yeah, Clara saved her mom, yadda yadda, it was all fine and good, but...REALLY? The power of love? Come on, now. This is just lame.Clara saving Tucker did remedy this a little. Ilovedhow she saved him, and not the other way round, as it always is in YA. Though the horse made me sad. It got burnded up. Poor thing.I could go on about how awesome it is that even though Christian is a god and he's gorgeous and everything Clara doesn't fall in love with him, but then I'd be bypassing what I really want to say:Christian is a fail.Sorry, but he is. First of all:Christian? You're in an angel book, and your name isChristian. So. Just...ugh. How trite.(view spoiler)[Though I did love how he turned out to be angel-blood in the end, it didn't really shock or amaze me. I kind of saw it coming. It's like a big glowy hand with the word "FORESHADOWING" tattooed all over it reaches out of the book and punches you repeatedly in the face."OMG Christian is gorgeous.""OMG Christian is a god.""OMG for some reason Christian can't be with Kay.""OMG Christian is inexplicably drawn to Clara.""OMG Christian is important for some UNKNOWN reason."(hide spoiler)]Oh, and another thing.Kay. Are you for real? Do we really need to keep on perpetuating the mean cheerleader wears-short-skirts-and-lip-gloss-and-flirts-audaciously-with-guys-therefore-must-be-evil stereotype? Really? Come now, Cynthia. Don't let yourself down.At times, the plot felt nebulous. Why? The fapping over hot boys. The endless stretches of time where nothing happened. It frustrated me, and distanced me from the characters, which I normallyloved. No one was TSTL, and though Tucker and I had our ups and downs (and ended on kind of a "we're okay" note) I thought he was a pretty decent, wholesome love interest. Clara was funny, multi-dimensional, and believable as a heroine. She and Tucker's relationship was healthy and their closeness was cute, which is a rarity in this genre, where creepy, stalky over-obsessive relationships are commonplace and it's not weird at all to watch yourvictimlover sleep. Okay, it was strange how Tucker managed to just dump Clara on her ass over the course of maybe two paragraphs, and then three days went by where Clara lay in her bed doing nothing, but this was quickly swept under the carpet and I could easily forget about any annoyance I may have had over it. All in all: the romance was nice.On the whole? A decent read. Good fun, well-written, and brilliantly researched. Lovely characters, some good pacing, and though the climax was kind of irritating, all in all it was pretty darn enjoyable. I award it three and a half stars. I liked it, and I'll be reading the sequel for sure.BONUS TIME!...because Bonus Time heals all wounds.It feels like time for a (rather enjoyable, very tame)...Drinking Game!Fill a cup up to the halfway with Kahlua. Every time someone pimps out their wings, pour in a ladel of hot cocoa. When you're done, stir up that bad boy, cover it with with a big squirt of whipped cream, take a gulp and enjoy not being drunk for a change.I love you all.
