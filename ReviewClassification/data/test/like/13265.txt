Wow, just wow! First let me begin by saying that this is one of my favroite series's that i've read. I loved it and each book had gotten better and better. If you haven't read this series then i suggest you do so. Now!This has to be my fave book in the trilogy. It had everything. Action, romance, humor....everything i've come to love about the Darkest Powers Trilogy.The characters are incridible as usual. I loved joining Chloe, Derek, Simon, Tori, Liz and sooo many others on their journey. It's characters like these that make the story so captivating and what it is.Chole was such a refreshing main character! There are so many books out there where the heroine is tough and confidant and completly flawless, and....while they're usually awesome characters, it's hard to believe that anyone can be that perfect. There was never a moment in this series when Chloe was 100% brave or when certain events or issues didn't get to her. This is what i loved about her. She wasn't always brave or sure of what she was doing, but she still did her best and what she had to do. This is what made her a strong, exceptional character. One i've loved to watch grow.And Derek....what can i say about him? Awesome, strong, protective Derek. Not your typical hunk of a male lead, but a honest, haunted individual. He too wasn't what i've come to expect of a lead in a book, but i loved him for that. It was everything he was that made him so interesting. He had such a great relationship with his brother and i liked how the friendship between he and Chloe developed into something more. Their interacations were the highlight of the series for me.Chloe and Derek have got to be amongst my fave book couples ever. They're relationship was one that drew me in each and every book and had me captured from the beginning. It was a first and true love. It was very cute. They were such an odd pair, so differnt, and yet they connected beautifully. I adored how Chole fell for Derek and how he gradually let her in. It was so sweet!I'm really sad this series is over. I'd love to see it go on and on, but Kelley Armstrong had ended it on an excellent note. Most loose ends are tired up, and yet there are so many possibilities for the characters. You just know they're gonna live happily ever after........
