This juvenile allegory reminded me greatly of The Giver. Just as at the start of The Giver, the young people of the community of Ember receive their future work assignments, a device which quickly pulls the young reader into the story. Now almost adults, Lina and Doon are able to view their community with fresh eyes, and discover that the generator, the source of electric power on which the town depends, is soon to be exhausted. This will plunge the city into complete darkness. The children discover a secret coded message, leading to a possible escape for the dying town.The heart of the allegory is in the different responses by various citizens to their town's problem: those who deny the problem, those who wait blindly for rescue, those who selfishly hoard as many goods for themselves as they can. It is easy to make application to various groups in our own society. Lina and Doon are among the few who actively search for a positive solution. Even within their own hearts they struggle with conflicts of fear and pride, which might have hindered the saving of the city.An excellent story which made me eager for the next book in the series!
