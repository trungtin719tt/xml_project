I loved this book. I loved the heroine; stubborn, tenacious, determined. I loved the world that Snyder created. I loved loved loved the main love interest, Valek. Dark, stoic assassin? Check. Me swooning throughout the whole book because I have a thing for assassins? Check. (Yeah, I know. I need to have my head examined.)But, the relationship between Yelena and Valek was only part of this wonderful story. The detail put into the poisons was facinating. The entire world was facinating. I literally picked this book up and did not put it down until that evening when I finished it. I'm going to get the next books, Magic Study and Fire Study, as soon as possible. Bravo to Maria Snyder for this wonderful novel.
