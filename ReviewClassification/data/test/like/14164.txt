6.0 stars. This book was beautifully written and the best way I can think to describe it is emotionally devastating (but in a good way). Nominally, it is a book about "first contact" with an alien race but the heart of the story is the age old question, "How can someone believe in a just, loving God when such horrible things happen to good people?"It has been over a year since I have read this book (in fact I just finished the sequel, Children of God), and I can still remember feeling blown away by the description of the "ordeal" of Emilio Sandoz which is central to the story.
