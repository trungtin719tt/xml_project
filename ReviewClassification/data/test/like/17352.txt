I was not quite sure at first about this book since this was the first time Author for me. But it did not take long for the words to absorb into my mind. Made me start to rethink things that I have been struggling with.I gotta say I was so disappointed in Charley as if I knew him. I could not understand how he could respect his Father, who ran out on him, so much more than his Mother, the one who saw to his well being, struggled and fought and worked hard so he would be taken care of, attend college, and have what he needed. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that there are probably a lot of people like that in this world.He cared for one thing, that happened to be baseball. Something he put before anything else in his life. And you know what, it is ok to love something, but I find it sad when only one aspect of your life can make you happy. And you sacrifice all your other blessings for this one thing.This book also made me reflect on my own life and losing both my parents. Always wondering if I did everything I could to show them that I loved them. I would give anything to have this 'one day' to be with them again. But it also made me finally realize that I did love them as much as I possibly could and it helps push me over a hurdle that I have been struggling with for so long. This book was almost a message to me in a way, and I feel thankful that I read it.Our parents are probably some of the most profound people in our lives. The first steps in the molding process. It is up to us to make the right choices so there are no regrets later. Because often times we are not given that 'one day' that Charley got to make things right. As long as you know that despite everything going wrong in your life, there will always be something in your life to be thankful for, you can save your own life.
