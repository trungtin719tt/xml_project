4 Major Mommy Issue Stars****Spoilers****First read 2014Reread 3/30/2017"She. Comes. With. Me."-VLover Unbound, the 5th book in the BDB series was great. I would have gave it 5 stars if not for Phury. Truly that Brother rubs me the wrong way every time he is on the page. And he had too many pages in this book. I know his book is next, but man I could've done with a lot less Phury. Anyways V and Jane's story was sweet, kinky, and very angsty. In this book there was a lot of different povs as J.R. Ward tends to jump from story line to story line almost like a soap. You get half a chapter of this couple then it shoots to another or this other brother, or the lessers etc. And while that kind of layout doesn't really bother me it was really pronounced in this book compared to the last 4 so it took some getting use too."I don't want you to go." "I don't want to leave you."-V and Jane"You are my son." V stopped breathing, his chest going concrete on him. Surely she meant that in the broader sense. "Three hundred and three years ago you were born of my body." The Scribe Virgin's hood rose off her face of its own volition, revealing a ghostly, ethereal beauty. "Lift thy so-called cursed palm and know our truth." Heart in his throat, V brought up his gloved hand, then ripped the leather off with messy tugs. In horror he stared at what was behind his tattooed skin: The glow in him was just like hers.-Scribe VirginPoor Vishous had some real mommy issues in this book. Never knowing who his mother was boy was he shocked when the Scribe Virgin came to him and let him know that she was in fact his birth mother, and that she was going to make him her "Primale". The Primale is the male that is mated to all the chosen, lives in the fade, and has to make babies with all his 40 or so mates. Like a stud bull or something. And she didn't care one bit that he didn't want to be her breed stud. So he was understandably pissed at mommy dearest. Also as V's past with this father the bloodletter is revealed and you find out the horrid torture he endure while his mother did nothing, yea she wasn't smelling like roses at all. V had some major emotional issues from his past. I loved the way he let Jane in and showed her the real him. Even as close as he was with Butch she and him just clicked. Jane was this amazing human surgeon. She saved V when he landed in her er with a stab wound and a gun shot to the chest. Jane didn't have the greatest of lives but she was smart as hell and made something of herself. What I really loved about Jane was that she didn't look like most heroines. She had short hair, glasses, flatter body and was more on the plain or average side when it came to her looks. I also loved that even though she wasn't a knockout she was totally comfortable and confident in her skin. She knew who she was, what she wanted, and her worth. I also really liked how open minded she was. She was calm under pressure, was wholly accepting, and supportive of her male."It is okay that you're still struggling with everything that was done to you. Anyone would. It doesn't make you weak. You were violently maimed by someone who should have protected and nurtured you. The fact that you're still standing is a miracle. I respect you for it."-Jane"I love you. And I'm going to keep loving you even after you don't know I exist."-VVishous is one kinky motherfucker. I loved the fact that even though V and Jane had kinky sex they made love as well. Something V had never done with anyone else. Jane and V really just kinda click like missing puzzle pieces that go together. I know a lot of readers are fans of Butch and V and wished they would have gotten together but I always just seen them as brothers and best friends so I was glad that the Warden didn't put them together. I was glad that Phury stepped up for V and became the primale. I was hoping that he would be able to redeem himself in the act but instead he just brought Cormia over here to a place where she doesn't know anything. She doesn't know how to use a phone, where to get food, how the simplest of things work. She was completely alone, scared shitless, and overwhelmed and he just pretty much abandoned her so he could go back to doing his drugs and lusting after his brother's wife Bella. I already didn't care for Phury from the way he acted like his brother Z was ruined but in this book my feelings for him started leaning towards dislike and I am so not looking forward to his book. Now John Matthew.... I want his book bad! I loved all the bonding him and Z have been doing. I also loved how Z really stepped up with teaching the classes and with JM. I really enjoyed the fact that this book was lesser pov free. Overall this book was a good addition to the series, but not one of my favorites.
