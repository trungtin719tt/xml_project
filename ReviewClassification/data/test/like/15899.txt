It could be said this has been on my TBR list since childhood. I don't remember reading it then, and don't remember reading it to my daughter. Although I've known the story of the "little bull with a gentle heart who turned into a big bull with a gentle heart" for quite some time, I'd never picked up a copy until now.Lovely little story, which shook the world one might say.It was banned in Spain during the Spanish Civil War since it was seen as a "pacifist" book. (Oh, the horror!)It was banned in Nazi Germany (by none other than Little Adolf) for being "degenerate democratic propaganda."We better watch out, girls and boys, if The Trumpet ever learns to read!How can you rate it less than 5 glorious stars when you know that it made Franco and Hitler shake in their tiny little boots, just at the thought of it?(And for what it's worth, it's a great little book for children too!)
