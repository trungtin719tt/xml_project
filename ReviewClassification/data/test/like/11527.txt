It's not the season for A Christmas Carol, I know!And we all know it by heart too, from reading it as children with our grandparents maybe, as young adults for essays in high school, as adults to our own children. We have watched the Disney version many times, and seen it performed on stage, for decades, in December.So why do I have to drag out my old, torn copy of my earliest traditional December Dickens in April? Because April is the cruellest month, and it made me realise how many Scrooges are out there, celebrating their narcissistic personality disorder as a virtue and key to their success while ignoring the needs of their families, friends and business partners. My fear, however, is that we have no willing ghosts left to show the Scrooges of our times the path back to caring and loving community.Where is the ghost to tell the greedy self-absorbed rich of today:"I wear the chain I forged in life," replied the Ghost. "I made it link by link, and yard by yard; I girded it on of my own free will, and of my own free will I wore it."Where is the understanding that laughter and humour is worth more than gold can ever pay for? Where is the LANGUAGE of Dickens to express that there is hope for humanity if we open our eyes and dare to see what is going on around us, rather than a reflection in a mirror of our own ugly fake face - hiding Dorian Gray's real portrait under the shining surface?I fear that the ghost of Old Marley may be dead as a doornail too!But I call on the Ghosts Of Literature Past to come back and teach us something of humanity's potential. Come now, today, in the cruellest of months. You can do it. Don't be scared of us humans. We are not as dangerous as we look.
