This is the 5th book in the Vampire Chronicles series, picking up after the events of the Tale of the Body Thief.Lestat once again feels that he's being followed, except this time, it is not by a human being, but by the Devil himself. The Devil, who prefers to go by the name of Memnoch (and not Satan or Lucifer), approaches Lestat because he wants him to be his assistant. Memnoch takes Lestat through the story of Creation, takes him into Heaven and Hell, and explains his disagreements with God.I found this book to be utterly fascinating, and I think it's because I am obsessed with the idea of angels and the supernatural lately. Anne Rice's take on Creationism and religion is just superb and I was thoroughly engrossed and drawn in. What I also enjoyed, was knowing that while Anne Rice was writing this, she was figuring out what her beliefs were, and I liked being able to go on the journey with her.This was very different to the other books in this series, but I thought that it was fresh and it has really kept my interest in the Vampire Chronicles alive. I will definitely continue with this series going forward, as and when I get my hands on the rest of the books.
