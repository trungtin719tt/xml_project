Thoughts:- If it was utterly up to me, I'd actually think about classing this more as a "utopia" rather than a "dystopia" understanding that they're ultimately the same thing.- Living in glass houses is the most terrifying part of this novel.- I-330 is basically a manic pixie dream girl.- The commentary on the Russian Revolution and Socialism are heavy, bro.- Zamyatin had a FASCINATING life that very much influences this book.- The writing style wasn't my thing. It was by no means bad, but it just wasn't my thing.On Comparing it to 1984:- So, the deal is that George Orwell absolutely admits that his book was inspired by this book, and any person who has read them both will know that this is undoubtedly true. Here are some of my observations.- We is more about Humanity, and 1984 is more about Politics.- The stakes feel higher in 1984.- I might be biased (I'm definitely biased) but Orwell improved on certain things (Room 101, general feelings of unrest, the book line).- One of the best parts of 1984 is when Winston becomes a traitorous bastard, and we didn't see that to the same extent in this novel.- The best part of 1984 is the last line, and this last line was good but not as good.You should read this, srs.
