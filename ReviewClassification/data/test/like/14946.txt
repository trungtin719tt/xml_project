The fifth installment of the Sookie Stackhouse series,Dead as a Doornail, was one I didn't care as much for the first time through. On re-reading it, I found I liked it quite a bit better. Someone is taking shots at the local shifters, and Sookie's brother Jason--newly made a werepanther--is under suspicion. The werepanther leader Calvin and the werewolf Alcide have not yet abandoned their interest in her, while her ex-lover Bill seems bent on making her jealous. Meanwhile, someone actively has it in for Sookie, going so far as to burn down her house.This is the book that initially made me crinkle my nose, as it introduces the weretiger Quinn, and that sort of went over a line for me of "one too many supernatural males interested in Sookie". But that one objection doesn't detract from a basically solid and engaging story. It's not too difficult to ID the perpetrators, but I didn't mind that much.Most entertainingly, the vampire Eric spends a good chunk of the book driven to distraction trying to remember the events of Book 4--and when Sookie finally gives in and tells him what he's unable to remember, that only increases his frustration. This for me is the high point of the plot, since it lays down intriguing hints of what's to come as I plow into new territory with books 6 and 7. For this one, three and a half stars.
