The Scorch TrialsThis was an awesome books, however not as good as the first.I loved all the mystery and constant suspense, although Thomas seemed to be sleeping or passing out a lot in this book :')I feel like not a lot happened, yet a lot did at the same time. This book definitely took a different turn and was very different to The Maze Runner.I'm excited to see how this ends, because I've heard very controversial things about it!These books are great so far and I really want to pick up some more of James Dashner's work in the future! :D
