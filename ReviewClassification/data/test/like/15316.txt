From Dead to Worseis the eighth book in Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse series. After not liking the last installment overmuch (All Together Dead), I thoughtFDTWwas a nice return to Sookie's roots and the foundation that made the series so good in the first place - Sookie being herself back home in Bon Temps, Louisiana.This book seemed like somewhat of a transition. After the huge events of the last book and the vampire summit, this book seemed to take a breath and recover a bit.The cast of characters expands as Sookie meets a relative (or two) that she didn't know she had, and we're also introduced to some witches as Sookie's group of supernatural friends grows. And as always, Sookie's romantic interests are a source of tension in the book as she tries to work out who and what's right for her - shifter, weretiger or vampire.It also contracts a bit as some characters were written out or killed off. No spoilers here, but it did seem a bit like Harris was wrapping up some loose ends so the story/series can move on.Alan Ball has created a series based on these novels for HBO... and after reading this latest addition to the series I'm back on board (I wasn't so sure after the last one) and looking forward to the show and the next book.
