Oh, this was such a delight to read! I didn't think a story about a family mystery could be so entertaining throughout, while still staying realistic and not going too over the top.Kate Morton just has the absolute best writing style for stories of this kind. She has a way of completely trapping you in the story she's telling, so that you lose yourself in it and just can't find a way out. And that's something highly positive! This is only the second book of hers I've read, but I'm already certain I'd have a wonderful time just reading her grocery list.This novel consists of over 50 chapters, each one of them told from a different point of view and taking place in a different time period. Sound like it's going to be confusing, right? Well, Mrs. Morton did her magic once again, and managed to not be confusing at all. I have no idea how she did it, but I was always able to picture everything that happened perfectly and each character had a distinctive voice, which made it easy to tell them apart.If I had to describe the plot in one word, I'd use "magical". It had so many layers, all very well thought out and interesting. There are many little details that get mentioned throughout. Some might call those details unnecessary, redundant or too elaborate, but as someone who loves long books with attention to minor things, it was an absolute joy to read such a fine work.I have to say, I was quite surprised at some of the dark themes that played a part. This especially concerns the ending, I really didn't expect this revelation. It was (surprisingly) fitting though, and I'm glad the author didn't shy away from going down this route.Lastly, I also feel the need to express my appreciation of the included fairy tales by Eliza Makepeace. I'd love to read more of them; they gave me a really comfy, warm and fuzzy feeling and reminded me of my childhood. Just lovely!
