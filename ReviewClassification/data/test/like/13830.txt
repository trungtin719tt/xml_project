The trouble with being a god is that you've got no one to pray to.What good is being a god when you're stuck in the body of a lowly tortoise, and your only follower is an uneducated melon-hoer?Yep, it sucks to be Om.Now, imagine poor Brutha's disappointment. One day he's quietly minding his melons, the next he's on some wild adventure with a smart ass tortoise who insists he's a god, even though THIS god is NOTHING like the prophets said he would be! For one thing, he doesn't have horns; for another, this so-called god can't even remember MEETING the prophets.The Prophet Hashimi!""Never met the man!""Oh? Oh? So I suppose you didn't give him the Book of Creation, then?""What Book of Creation?""You mean you don't know?""No!""Then who gave it to him?""I don't know! Perhaps he wrote it himself!"Whoa! A blasphemous god! You don't meet one of those every day!These little exchanges between Om and Brutha are priceless."Opened my eyes...my eye...and I was a tortoise.""Why?""How should I know? I don't know!" lied the tortoise."But you...you're omnicognisant," said Brutha."That doesn't mean I know everything."Brutha bit his lip. "Um. Yes. It does."I've always had a fondness for characters who are forced to hold conversations with entities that no one else can see. Hilarity frequently ensues, as everyone else assumes you're talking to yourself, and therefore, just a bit batty. (Does anyone besides me rememberMy Partner the Ghost?)This is not Pratchett's funniest book, but there's still a lot to love here. Just about everyone and every thing is mocked, and that's always good for us all.I'll let Brutha have the final word."You know, I used to thinkIwas stupid, and then I met philosophers."Amen, Brother Brutha.
