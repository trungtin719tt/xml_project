Finally.And he starts to feel terrified. Because he has lost everyone he loves.ThoughtsThis book was filled with unforgettable moments and lines. It easily rates in my TOP TWENTY of the best books I have read in 2012. And it's in the top five percentile no doubt. It has a perfect balance ofmystery, humor, romance, and intensity.The use of symbolism comes at you in so many ways that your brain races to catch up to it. It was used withhands, notebooks, clothes, and names.For instance hands. Nastya obsessed over other peoples ability to use their natural talents with just their hands. Her jealousy was potent at times because of the loss she herself experienced with her hands.One of the many things that makes this book awesome is the character development. The author does a very good job with allowing you to get to know each main character and what makes them tick. You feel their actions said and unsaid. You understand why they choose to do certain things for example why they hold back or why they give you just enough. Another awesome thing was the secondary love story with Drew and Tierney. I loved these two! I would love to see Drew have his own book I adored his character. Just thought I would throw that in to the universe to see what happens. **wink,wink**Fave Phrase"Distractingly Pretty"~JoshFave Thing Unsaid'I know at the moment what he has given me and it's not a chair.
