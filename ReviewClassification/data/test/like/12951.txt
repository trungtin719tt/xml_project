Book Review4 out of 5 stars forOne Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish, a children's picture book written in the 1960s byDr. Seuss. I loved this one as a child, and probably read it around 7 or 8 years old, then again at 10. Between the rhymes and tongue-twisters, it encourages kids to laugh and have fun when reading. Focusing on pets, under water fish are my favorite. All the colors, shapes and sizes. All the things to do with them. Dr. Seuss is a definite children's classic, but with pictures and movies being made, it helps bring it all full circle. I love buying these books for my friend's children, then sitting to read with them. Great memories!About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT.
