Nice story of romance surrounding a mystery about who killed Missy the wife of Miles, a sheriff's deputy. He's coming out of his shell of grieving when he stumbles into love again, but the haunting uncertainty of his wife's death puts his life into jeopardy. A heartwrming tale of a father's love for his young son also tugs along the way as well. Worth reaching back to this novel by one of my favorite Southern authors.
