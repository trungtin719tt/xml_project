This is a novel that, as I understand it, almost single-handedly revived the popularity of medieval chivalry and heroism in 19th century literature . . . and life. The culture of the American South profoundly admired Scott's world view. Stories likeIvanhoewere spiritual fuel to their sense of honor and privilege.Also, with Scott, a major branch of literature was consolidated which in his time was beginning to be distinguished by the intelligentsia from "serious literature." His literary heirs are James Fenimore Cooper, Alexander Dumas pere, and Robert Louis Stevenson. Jane Austen headed up the other major branch which included George Eliot, Henry James and Joseph Conrad. This is of course a grossly simplified classification, but for some purposes a useful one which both Scott and Austen recognized. I call Scott's branch "romantic," and Austen's branch, "realistic" and/or "naturalistic."Ivanhoe is top-notch romantic adventure. Just get past the first couple of chapters and you'll be hooked.
