"Always, always you recede through the eveningstowards where the twilight goes erasing statues."An enduring collection of exquisite verses. Even though translated from Spanish, these words sound eloquent and lyrical.Simple, sensual, beautiful words filled with tenderness and a vivid imagination."I will bring you happy flowers from the mountains,bluebells,dark hazels, and rustic basket of kisses.I wantto do with you what spring does with the cherry trees."Lush, rich, intense words filled with reverence and longing."As all things are filled with my soulYou emerge from the thingsFilled with my soulYou are like my soulA butterfly of dreamAnd you are like the word: MelancholyI like for you to be stillAnd you seem far awayIt sounds as though you are lamentingA butterfly cooing like a doveAnd you hear me from far awayAnd my voice does not reach youLet me come to be still in your silence"Passionate, evocative, haunting words filled with a burning desperation."I no longer love her, that's certain, but maybe I love her.Love is so short, forgetting is so long.Because through nights like this one I held her in my armsmy soul is not satisfied that it has lost her.Though this is the last pain that she makes me sufferand these the last verses that I write for her."The song of despair at the end is an assortment of heart breaking, soul shattering words that speak of a sizzling fiery torment."The memory of you emerges from the night around me.The river mingles its stubborn lament with the sea.Deserted like the wharves at dawn.It is the hour of departure, oh deserted one!Cold flower heads are raining over my heart.Oh pit of debris, fierce cave of the shipwrecked.In you the wars and the flights accumulated.From you the wings of the song birds rose.You swallowed everything, like distance.Like the sea, like time. In you everything sank!"It is no wonder Pablo Neruda was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature.However, what did not appeal to me was the objectification of women. I found it rather annoying.Apart from that, this is a lovely collection of elegant and intimate poems.
