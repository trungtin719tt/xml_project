I loved this book from the beginning. The anger and passion of Trudi captivated me from beginning to end, and I had a hard time putting this book down.I found that I had to concentrate harder on this book due to the number of characters, and with all of the german names. This made it much harder to rush through the book, which ultimately should be cherished anyway.I loved Trudi's strengths as a story teller, and her understanding of her surroundings that bordered on magical realism.Will read again someday when I can spend more time on the individual beautiful words, rather than trying to get to the end of a very good story.
