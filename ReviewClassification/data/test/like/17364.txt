Fey, Fae, whatever you choose to call them, they are amazing, and while I haven't read so many books with fae, I am always astounded by the amazing stories they make up for.This one was a suprise. The first one, it was really good but I never thought I'd give the next one 5 stars, but it really was amazing so I couldn't help but giving the highest rating there is.So, the book picks up from where it left off in the first book. Ash delivers Meghan to the Unseelie Court. What happens next is for you to find out. I'll just say that there are betrayals, and a known-to-you-someone is rising to take Machina's place, which is just bad bad news.Like the first one, this was full of adventure. It's really fast-paced and while for some the fast-pace thingy doesn't work, I love it when it's well-executed.Meghan has lost her powers so she's kind of at the mercy of the other's help. Not that I'm complaining about her companions. Puck blew me away, this guy, always grinning, always being the positive one, he's just amazing. And my heart is breaking for him... You know why.Ash, the icy prince, well, he's not going to be icy for long.The romance is heating up, the adventure got better, the plot thickens, the characters are wonderful. These are the reasons why I gave this 5 stars and I really hope to give the next one 5 stars as well.
