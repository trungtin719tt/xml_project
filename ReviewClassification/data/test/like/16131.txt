A cult decides to kill themselves. One of the members, Tender Branson, decides not to. He goes away to make a life for himself but finds out that someone else survived from the cult - his twin brother. And his brother is going to complete the ritual by killing Tender and then himself. Meanwhile, Tender's survival attracts the main stream media and his views become the subject of a religion unto themselves. He becomes a messiah like figure. Then it all goes wrong and it ends with Tender hijacking a plane, emptying it of passengers, and telling his life story to the black box before crashing the plane into the desert.This is Chuck Palahniuk's best novel. It's original, it's funny, it's fascinating, and it articulates his world view brilliantly. The "suicide hotline" where people on the edge call the number thinking they're going to be talked out of it only to find Tender on the other side urging them on was a particularly inventive and funny part of the book. The idea of a new messiah having to have a Superman like body in order to be accepted was also another great observation (look at those shots of Obama at the beach!).Most of all, it's a great novel. Not just for the kind of people who read Palahniuk but for anyone to read whether they're moody teens or angry young men in their 20s or middle aged people looking for a good book.
