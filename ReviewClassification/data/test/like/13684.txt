"Ready?" "Ready if you are."Well, that was fun! Not super original, not super greatly written, not very deep. But a story that lets you fall into it and welcomes you.One thing that bothered me: It's a German book by a German author. Why make it play in London like every other young adult fantasy book? Kinda lame.Still happy I read it. :)
