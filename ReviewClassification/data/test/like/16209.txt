The novel easily grabs your attention--and keeps it. It's written in an easy-to-read style, full of adventure, excitement, and a good dash of humour. I enjoyed it from beginning to end (with plenty of pauses for a good laugh.) As the series progresses, both the author's writing and his character development improves. The first book is typical -- bullies, evil villain ruling strange creations (wargals), and a life-changing choice. But even so, it's a fresh look on the common story-line.While the author develops some engrossing, endearing characters, he also flips from one's thoughts to another. That's sometimes confusing. The prologue made me put the book down -- rather then suck me in. It may be necessary, but it's confusing. Once past it, however, you'll want to keep turning the pages.I thoroughly enjoyed the book (as well as the progressing series). You'll never forget the characters of Halt and his apprentice, Will, or their wild adventures -- and you may just find yourself trying out some archery. The book is good for any age, though recommended for the tweens (between kids and teens). You'll be looking for the next book when you've finished this one.
