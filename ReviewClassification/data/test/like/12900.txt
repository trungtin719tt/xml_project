Quantum by name, and very much quantum by nature. This is a fascinating sci-fi read with some mind-bending properties as the plot gets underway and the action hots up. I may not be the biggest reader of the science-fiction genre, but when I do find a pretty great book from there I really do enjoy it.I enjoyed the character of Olan, and to me feels strong enough that he could be used to make Quantum Roots into a long series of novels.
