5 stars for being a ludicrously entertaining soap opera. The most lurid, overdone philosophical text I've ever read (probably because I haven't gotten to Atlas Shrugged yet).Whether you agree with Rand's ideas or not (please say you don't!), it's pretty damn entertaining to watch them played out via a cast of steely heroes and sniveling villains. The S&amp;M sex scenes are probably the best part - objectivism in the bedroom.Worth reading for sure, if you can keep your head on your shoulders and not succumb to a 600-page argument full of pedantic speeches and flimsy straw men.
