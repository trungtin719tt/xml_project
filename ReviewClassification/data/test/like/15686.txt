I don't know if I have words to express my feelings regarding this book. I loved it. It's a rare day that I find a book that describes my own relationship with my wonderful husband. Oh, Jack! Why did you have to leave again? I'm sitting here wishing I could hug and hold my Ben but he is a soldier on another mission in Africa. But, at least he will be home again.I felt so connected to this story. Such a part of it and I understood Sarah so well. I think like her. I'm independent and always doing or thinking things that others don't always approve of, but I don't care. This is a book that will forever stay with me.Thank you, Karina Palmer &amp; Tracie Carter for recommending this book.
