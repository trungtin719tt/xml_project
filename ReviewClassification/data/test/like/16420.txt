Some books you read. Some books you enjoy. But some books just swallow you up, heart and soul.Very truly so.Penning a review for this book is hard, so is the book itself. Complex and intricately sewn together.No, I am not revealing the plot to you, dear wife. All I am saying is that this is a different work altogether. And a very, very fine one indeed.The story weaves childhood memories and nightmares, beliefs and myths into one fragment after another, until the fabric is tight enough to hold the weight of interdependence. A child who knows a lot. Someone who knows that he knows things that his parents don't know he knows.The fears are as vivid as it can be our owns. Mr. Gaiman captures the feeble nature of childhood perfectly in this work.He confessed that he actually meant it to be a short story that got out of control.Interestingly so, the author attributes the motivation for writing this masterpiece to deal with a 4 month separation from his wife.The result was a thoroughly engaging and majestically laced novel. An ocean of feelings.Told you, this is the hardest book to be reviewed I have read this year.So, I will let that be the end.A perfect glittering5 stars!
