(view spoiler)[ Max and Fang. Two peas in a pod. I've got your back, you got mine, kind of relationship. Right? That's all it is? Wrong. Fang and Max share a kiss. Awkward. While things remain weird and unsolved amongst them, they end up stuck with the whitecoats...again. Once they are able to escape, Max makes a spur of the moment decision. She decides to spare the life of a former enemy who once tried to kill her and invites him along. Fang utterly disagrees. He believes Ari, the former enemy, whether the decision to help them escape was honest or a scam, can't be trusted. Max believes differently. Max and Fang both believe strongly about their opinion and can't agree. They end up going their separate ways. Max, Angel, Nudge, Total, and Ari go one way. Fang, Iggy, and Gasman go the other. Will Max and Fang be able to make things right? Or will Fang and his group be too late to help save Max and her group from the dreaded whitecoats?(hide spoiler)]
