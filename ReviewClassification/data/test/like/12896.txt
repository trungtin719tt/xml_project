This book is the sequel to Quantum Roots but it can be read and understood without reading the first novel. In this story, a segment of the FBI called the Department of Paranormal Activity is called upon to investigate a number of strange vigilante killings. The killer always shows up at exactly the time a crime is being committed and ends the crime with a shot to the head for each criminal. Just as quickly as this mysterious vigilante appears, he is gone without a trace, hence the reason the paranormal crew is called in to help. This book starts with a particularly disturbing scene with an attempted rape and then brutal killings. This is not the last time the reader will encounter violence of this book so be prepared for some brutality.The writing is easily digestible and not difficult to follow despite the sci-fi aspect and the theories on time and creation. I love anything having to do with wormholes and/or the nature of time and existence. This book will definitely get you thinking, or at least it did me.Despite the somewhat simple nature of the writing, the characters and storyline details are well-developed. I loved the dynamics between Alexis and Jeremy. So funny and entertaining! I could definitely see this type of relationship in real life!In all this book was interesting, unique, creative, easy to read, somewhat violent but highly entertaining. This is some good light sci-fi for those who enjoy the genre!
