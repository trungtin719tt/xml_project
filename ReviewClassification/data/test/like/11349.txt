My mom's been bugging me for years to read this. I resisted, because, well, mom books. I thought it would be silly, I thought it would be overwrought, I thought it would be chick-lit...and it wasn't! I was pleasantly surprised. It's no deep, mystery-thriller, but it wasn't a complete throw-away beach read, either. I enjoyed it and I'll get #2 on hold from the library. This looks like a good fill in read, a go-to read when I have nothing on tap and need a capable stand in.Thanks Mom!
