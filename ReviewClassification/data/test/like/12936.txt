I thoroughly enjoyed this book! Her writing is soothing, enlightening, and full of wisdom and beauty.Some of my favorite quotes:Woman's life today is tending more and more toward the state William James describes so well in the German word, "Zerrissenheit--torn-to-pieces-hood." She cannot live perpetually in "Zerrissenheit." She will be shattered into a thousand pieces. On the contrary, she must consciously encourage those pursuits which oppose the centrifugal forces of today. Quiet time alone, contemplation, prayer, music, a centering life proceeding from oneself. It need not be an enormous project or a great work. But it should be something of one's own.""It is fear, I think, that makes one cling nostalgically to the last moment or clutch greedily towards the next. Fear destroys 'the winged life.'...When the heart is flooded with love there is no room in it for fear, for doubt, for hesitation. And it is this lack of fear that makes for the dance. When each partner loves so completely that he has forgotten to ask himself whether or not he is loved in return; when he only knows that he loves and is moving to its music--then, and then only, are two people able to dance perfectly in tune to the same rhythm.""The present is passed over in the race for the future...The here, the now, and the individual, have always been the special concern of the saint, the artist, the poet, and--from time immemorial--the woman. In the small circle of the home she has never quite forgotten the particular uniqueness of each member of the family; the spontaneity of now; the vividness of here. This is the basic substance of life."
