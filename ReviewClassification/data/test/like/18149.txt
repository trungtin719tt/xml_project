A novel for all-time. The one who made me to love books.At my age when I read it, I was likeWHAT THE HELL, WHAT's THE MEANING OF THAT WORD. I was13at that time, I always make a fool out of myself. My classmates were asking me how can I understand it or do I understand it, all kinds of questions who irritates me.3 months=1 book!I mean how hurtful and so hateful with it! There are more books than to read! And my goal for my life is to read more than 100 books or even more!I HATE NOVELS*coughs* not anymore.I love Michael Crichton for this book! So far I've read 4 works of him and this one is the most that I like. With all the Time-Travel Theme and Quantum Physics thing, mixed with Middle Age, and the characters became history more than they know. All the actions going from every side of the fight.This novel takes a group of historians, and test their courage, faith, hope, and the will to live among a time they don't belong and shouldn't exist.Timeline takes you to a thrilling, one-of-a-kind adventure who will take your breath in a deadly fight between their life and their timeline. :)
