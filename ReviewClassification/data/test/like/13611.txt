I enjoyed this book so much, even more than Wonderstruck which I loved. The illustrations are wonderful and the way the story is told in text and then for several pages in drawing is so unique. This book also has some vintage photography of the era which really helps set the scene.Hugo is an orphan with a talent for machinery, he lives in a railway station in Paris and tends to the clocks and steals food to get by. He has a secret that he focusses all his energy into trying to complete in his father's memory. When he meets another orphan their stories come together and end in a very satisfying conclusion.The characters were wonderful, I want to spend more time with them. I loved the inclusion of the stills from films and the information on these factual elements included in the back pages.The pictures make you race through what would otherwise seem like a huge book, it's an ideal read for children who find a longer book a struggle.9th September 2018. My daughter is reading this now, we just looked up the Harold Lloyd clock scene which is pictured as a still in this book. It is from the film 'Safety First' 1923, watched the film on YouTube, well worth a look.
