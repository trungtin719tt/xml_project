3.5 stars.I went into this expecting it to be a super fluffy teen-girl-friendship-group story, kind of like the movie Now and Then?? And it totally seemed like that's what it was going to be at the beginning of the book. And yet somewhere along the way, it took a turn and detoured down STAB YOU IN THE FEELS Lane. Which I was totally not expecting and still don't quite know how to process.It's a little dated now, and some of the parental actions are a little bit "WTF WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT" as an adult. (Actually, a lot of the teen actions fall into that camp too, but that's pretty standard for YA books...) And the included letters between the girls kind of drove me nuts because half of them could have fitted on a post-it, and why the hell would you spend a ton of money posting a letter that's three lines long?! I mean, my friends and I used to send each other letters during the school holidays when we were in high school. But they were always at least 4 A4 pages long. So...the letters grated.But on the whole, this was a lot more than I expected. I took off a quarter of a star because it took me at least half of the book to actually get into the story. So. Yeah.
