Wow, what a book. So comprehensive, yet written in laymens terms and cranking up the technical information with each chapter, so you don't feel completely lost. By the time you reach quantum mechanics and string theory you almost feel like you know what's happening. Okay, so you still have no idea how any of it works, but that's alright.I've never felt compelled to read this. A book about space and physics is not my go to reading material and all of it sounds way over my head. However, it's such a well known science classic that I think a lot of people still have it on their tbr list. One for later.I wish I'd read this before and hadn't been so afraid of the science. It was easily digestible, broken into smallish chapters and often recapped previous topics, to help them really sink in. I still don't understand how black holes work, or how the universe was made, but neither does anyone for sure. I'm glad that others do the hard work to try to find out though.
