This book was genius and turned concepts based on traditional ideology, upside down. It wasn't about good and evil (which is boring, in comparison), but suggests A truth which is that we can never know THE real truth about supernatural things, including God. It shows how eager we are to believe in something, even Lestat, a vampire and the main character (and also THE Lestat), needed to believe. Anne Rice said of this book "I was also tormented by a multitude of theological and sociological questions, and I never anticipated a time when the answers would not matter to me, or a time when I would know a resolution."Yes - this is fiction and it's Anne Rice. As I've been reading her work, all of it since finishing this novel, I'm amazed at the metaphor she's chosen to exercise her spiritual questions/struggle (in the vampire novels). She's amazing and complex and incredibly spiritual. People associate her with vampires. I associate her with a human consciousness and moral awareness. She gives a narrative from which one can explore transformation and redemption.
