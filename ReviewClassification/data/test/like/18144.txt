This book was my introduction to Crichton and I fell in love!I fell in love because this is an author who does extensive research on the subjects he writes about. So he not only entertains, he teaches you something in the process.In Timeline, Crichton combines science(quantum technology) and history(medieval) in a heart-stopping adventure. A group of historians are given the opportunity to literally enter life in fourteenth-century feudal France. But this is not your typical time travel story.
