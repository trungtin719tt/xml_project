I've read Anne of Green Gables over 7 years ago and it became a favorite, but I never continued the series. Picking the second book up so many years later, I was a little nervous I might not like it, but I my fears turned out to be groundless.Anne of Avonlea reads like a collection of anecdotes of a village life. It is fluffy and cute, innocent without being preachyand gives one a warm feeling inside. It was also funny - I laughed out loud many times throughout the book.Avonlea is full of good people. They help each other. They do the best they can. They fail (mostly in a hilarious way), but still, they try. And this is your ticket to watch them do it. Anne is growing up and faces new questions about the world and about herself. Though she is mostly in the background in this book, serving as an observer who integrates all the short stories about the side-characters.The book was delightful and insubstantial, like a mousse dessert. It is definitely not plot-driven - it passes over you like a collection of clouds and you may make of it what you will. I think I'll continue on reading the series, but probably translated to one of the languages I need improvement in.
