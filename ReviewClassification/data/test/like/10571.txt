You haven't read The Series of Unfortunate Events before? You gasp!No...Well, YES. I have now! Sort of...I've read The Bad Beginning and why did no one tell me how much fun these books were?! It's a quick read that has the right amount of everything. Horror, deception, dark humour, a riveting storyline and very, very bright children.You all probably know what it's about though. I'm just late to the party. I can now officially jam son the bandwagon for the NETFLIX SERIES THOUGH!!! The excitement is too much!
