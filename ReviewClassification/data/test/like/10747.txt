I read this book back in early March.March. And I left one of those little notes saying that I was going to compile my thoughts and would be back soon to write a review. Well, um, it seems it took me a bit longer than I thought possible to get over everything I experienced with this series. Truth be told, I'm still reeling from it.Unlike a good few other readers, I didn't nab each book as it came out and it wasn't until around the time thatShadowfeverwas being released that I actually picked up the first book -Darkfever. But I read them all in the space of a week. I honestly don't know how I would have survived if I'd read each book as they were released and I'm just thankful that I didn't have to wait between that dreaded cliffhanger at the end ofDreamfeverand the final book. How did some of you cope? This series is an addiction in every way. The last time I became so addicted to a story and its characters was back when I was watchingBuffy.This is a book and a series that I feel very strongly about and, because of that, I want to say what needs to be said to get everyone to read it. What can I tell you? Well... there's a heroine who both kicks ass and paints her nails Barbie pink, Mac is the perfect mix of strong and feminine. Don't letKristin Cashorekid you that those two don't mix, Mac will prove you wrong. If it weren't for Barrons I'd probably have developed a literary crush on Mac instead. Ah, butBarrons...Apparently a few women don't like Barrons and I suppose everyone's entitled to their own opinion but...SERIOUSLY WTF? YOU DON'T LIKE BARRONS??I'm joking. Sort of. Maybe. Anyway, I happen to think Barrons is one of the sexiest characters in any book I've ever read. He takes crap from no one, he seems serious most of the time but he's got a wicked sexy grin when he wants to. I like how KMM didn't make him into some hero, she never tried to redeem him and made it clear that Barrons has no time or need for redemption. He's the biggest, baddest alpha and he loves it... and you know you do too!But I'm going to sell this series all wrong if I'm not careful. This isn't a paranormal romance, it's an urban fantasy. The key difference being the quality of the story and mythology. Don't go thinking that it was just these awesome characters that kept me mesmerised for the full five books. There's mystery and supernatural creatures (yes, they're fairies but DO NOT let that put you off), there's murder and the dredging up of past secrets... it has everything.This series is one of my all time favourites. It can make you laugh and make you cry. There's smut (woo!) without making it a book all about sex and there's well thought out mythology that is never boring. What else can I say? Read it.
