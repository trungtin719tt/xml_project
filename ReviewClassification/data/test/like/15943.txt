This is the "granddaddy" of the modern dystopian novel, the book that influenced Huxley'sBrave New World, Rand'sAnthem, and Orwell's 1984: Yevgeny Zamyatin'sWe(1924). I've read it repeatedly and taught it, as well, and I always discover something new in the novel each time I turn to it. It's a brilliantly chilling depiction of a futuristic totalitarian regime that organizes its people's lives with almost scientific precision, as seen through the troubled eyes of one of its leading citizens. Zamyatin is very clever in his use of names and numbers and mathematics, and his psychological portrait of the protagonist is as absorbing as it is disturbing. Also of special note are the remarkable secondary women characters. This book was banned in Zamyatin's native Russia for over sixty years. It remains a first stop for anyone wanting to explore the dystopian tradition, and an excellent example of science fiction at its finest.
