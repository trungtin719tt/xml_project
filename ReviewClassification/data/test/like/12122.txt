You really can't judge a book by its cover.People have recommended Rosamunde Pilcher's books to me for years, and I refused to read them because all the covers looked like they had been marinated in mothballs. But after spying "The Shell Seekers" on the BBC's "The Big Read: Top 100 Books," I decided to bite the bullet and give it a try. Annoyingly, several people had put it on reserve at the library before me, so by the time I received it, I wasn't nearly as enthusiastic as I had been when I had originally ordered it. To add insult to injury, my copy had a cover that resembled a fussy spinster's guest room wallpaper. I literally had to fight the urge to hide the book under my jacket, lest one of my hipster friends caught sight of me leaving the building with it.But then I opened the front cover and started to read. And was captivated by the first sentence. And the second. By the time I had reached the last page, I was head over heels in love with this book. If you're smart enough to overlook a stupid looking cover for the sake of a great read, pick up this book. You won't be sorry.
