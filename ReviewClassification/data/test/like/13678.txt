Well that was a fun ride! I read this in one sitting for the #rainbowthon 2.0 and I really enjoyed it!I definitely feel like this was a great opening and solid setup for the rest of the trilogy; but while it was incredibly fun there was definitely no rising action or climax in the story. It was also a bit predictable (seriously, I saw that twist coming from the prologue) but I love Gwen (and her friendship with Lesley!) so much that that didn't bother me as much as it usually does. I liked figuring things out along with her. The romance (or lack thereof) was also very refreshing...although I do want to see it develop more in the next book because I want to swoon a little bit. Can you really blame me?I'm definitely interested in seeing where the story goes and how the time travel and stone system (?) works and the bigger role it plays in the story. Overall, I just really enjoyed this. It was a fun ride.
