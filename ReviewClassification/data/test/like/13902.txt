The Color of Magic is, in fact, four novella-length stories stitched together to create a novel-length book. But don't you worry, the book reads well as a whole without a jerking bump to stop the journey. I wouldn't have even noticed the stitching if I haven't known it was there.As the story starts, Rincewind a disgraced wizard meets up with Twoflower an oblivious tourist and his rather menacing walking luggage (yes, with a luggage like Twoflower's you don't have to worry about carry your things around; the several pairs of feet under the large chest will follow you keeping your belongings close by and always safe... did I mention the luggage may eat anyone trying to rob you?).Wizard and tourist are thrown together by unforeseen, and fantastic -but not at all unbelievable- circumstances, and soon engage in a tour of Discworld (the alternate universe born from Pratchett's supreme inventiveness). The tour is funny and surprising, and the story will carry you around without effort. However, if you're looking for a tight plot, consistent world building, or if silly British humor annoys you, this novel, and all Discworld for all that matters, may not be for you. The plot does meander a bit, but Pratchett's writing skills keep your focus somewhere else, so you don't even care.One thing is clear even in this the first novel of the Discworld series, Pratchett has bucket loads of talent. If you like to laugh, then Pratchett's your man. His comedy timing is fantastic, and he possesses the intellect and the ability to make you laugh out loud regardless if you like, or read, or are even familiar with fantasy (nonetheless, some familiarity with the basic tropes of fantasy will aid in your enjoyment).However, if you've read other Discoworld novels, you will notice that when it comes to topical humor, this novel is a bit thinner than Pratchett's later additions to the series; understandable, since it was written more tan two decades ago. Now, regardless of it age, the novel still feels remarkably fresh , mostly thanks to the imperishable quality of humor in which we laugh at ourselves.
