I read this book ages ago and it is one of my favourites. Clearly I have a bit of a morbid sense of enjoyment, given this is about the end of the world. The war is over and a radioactive cloud is slowly killing everyone in the world. An American submarine captain, Dwight Towers and his crew arrive on the shores of Australia: the last inhabitants of the world. Dwight Towers and his crew, along with the Australian Lieutenant-Commander Peter Holmes set out on a submarine mission to America to identify where a morse code signal is coming from. Maybe there are some survivors after all?I just adore this book and the movie, with Gregory Peck playing Dwight Towers. It is sad, frightening, creepy, depressing, and yet I love it! It gets me thinking about how I would behave if I knew the world was coming to an end and reminds me of the important things in life. I read a few of the reviews for this, and some of them are quite negative. I noticed a lot of people thought it was silly. I think when reading this novel, we need to remember that it was written in the 1950s. Times were a bit different then, and what happens in this novel was a real fear at the time (so my mum says!). To me it's a real fear now as well. Highly recommend giving it a try, but I wouldn't bother if you would rather a zombie apocalypse (that to me is silly!).
