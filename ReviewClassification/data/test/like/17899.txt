"I heard the mailman approach my office door, half an hour earlier than usual."The first book in the Dresden Files series, I found this quite exciting. It felt like being picked up by a slightly crazy person, and pulled through a labyrinth by your shirt; all the while having not one creature, but many, trying to kill the person dragging you along with them. You're in for some ride, and the main character is definitely a manwithouta plan.Our main character is the wizard extraordinaire, Harry Dresden. He does freelance detective work, but also consults with the Chicago P.D., and he has a doozy of a case. He seems like a decent guy; however he's not the most organized, or prepared. He has a bad habit of underestimating the situations he finds himself in, so you never know what he's going to pull off to stay alive. It makes for great fun and an interesting story. You're never lacking for either suspense or intrigue, and boy, oh boy, the segues from drama to action are nonexistent. One minute you're trying to figure something out, solve the mystery, and the next, someone's trying to kill Harry. It changes that quickly, so you simply never know what's about to happen.I'm really looking forward to book two. I'm curious as to how Harry's character evolves from here and what adventure is next. What's the next crime scene going to be like? What dangerous situations will he barely escape next? Will he be more prepared? Does he get a second date with the reporter or does he get burned? I think I'm going to go read Fool Moon and find out."I'm in the book."
