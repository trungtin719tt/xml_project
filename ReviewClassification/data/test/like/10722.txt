Welcome to the sparkling, colorful and vibrant world of racehorses and tournaments with his legends, dramas and passions.... located in the USA of the nineteenth twenties .......Openly speaking, friends, let me say that I would never have pick up a book about racehorses and only because of the greats and awesome reviews at goodreads, and also because Laura Hillenbrand was the author, did I in the end made my mind up to read this one......and thanks God that I did!!!!!Let me tell you also that this book is written brilliantly and masterly, believe me folks, if I say that you will not be able to put it down, its not an exaggeration at all.....Then if you will include the fact that Hillenbrand was severely sick at the time she wrote it and has rendered indeed a marvelous and thoroughly researched piece of work, then you will be left dumbfounded to the uttermost.Also, I have learned a lot about horses, jockeys, tournaments, competitions, and the feeling that existed in the America of the depression era, people trying to recuperate from a financial depression and a war going on!!!!Having said that, it remains still a tale of resilience, fight, and the story of an underdog--what in my opinion is almost always a good one, indeed--The main characters arouse empathy, so that you will suffer with them, although they are full of flaws and defects, but they never give up!!!!Please, let me say it again, Laura Hillenbrand can indeed write, and that very very good!!!!!Believe me....."Seabiscuit" has reminded me positively of her other book "unbroken"......A wonderful and an inspiring tale, I did love and enjoy it to the uttermost indeed......Five stars, and happy about that!!!!!Dean;D
