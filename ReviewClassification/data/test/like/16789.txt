Been following Ben Peller's work for awhile, and it keeps getting better. This summer was a great season of books for me, and this one was no exception. In this tale Peller has Shawn Michals out of Los Angeles on an island, and he is seduced by Bina, a woman I would personally love to meet in real life. (Actually, she kind of reminds me of a friend of mine). She captures his heart and soul and from there they proceed to change the course of their island's political and religious chaos. There are many detours along the way, fantasyLAnds to be explored, and in the end the reader may wonder whether the whole story itself is a fantasy hatched by a drunken Shawn Michals still alone in a room in Los Angeles (see the previous "To Live" books). But no spoiler alerts here. Read this book and let the revolution begin!
