LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this book! I saw so much of myself in the main characters spending personality that it just made me laugh all the way thru reading it. The book has that Bridget Jones feel but wer as Bridget is clueless in relationships Rebecca is clueless with credit and spending. Her crazy schemes to make extra money, like homemade potholders to sell but never following thru on is a page out of my life. I gave up credit cards as my solutions and it appears that she finds her own way to keep her credit and her life good by the books end. I can only assume since the original book there have been countless missteps to her financial redemption since there are now many shopaholic books. I have never read the sequels since I fear they will ruin the original to me. Making mistakes like she makes once is funny never learning from your mistakes book after book would just make the character pathetic to me. This book is also a super fast and easy read, so it is perfect to take on a trip and read on the plane or while laying by the pool.
