Interesting and well written fictional biography. The main character is born into the fictional "Ladover" Jewish movement. It is fairly obvious though that "Ladover" stands for the Chabad Orthodox Hasidic movement, today one of the largest Hasidic movements in the world. The main topic is the difficulty of realizing his dream to become an artist painter, without dropping his religious convictions. It is a "feel good" story that manages to avoid becoming too sentimental, and provides interesting details about the Chabad way of life.
