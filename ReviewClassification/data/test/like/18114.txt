A bit confused about how to rate this, Might upgrade it to 5 stars someday. I'm super glad to continue this series and to find that I still love it, was a bit scared I won't.The plot is as amazing as always, and its Cat's crazy ex that is in the way of their relationship. The whole team is still present in this part,(view spoiler)[ except for Tate and others in Homeland security who just made an appearance, mainly cause she quit.(hide spoiler)]. The writing style is astounding and fast paced.A crazy vampire who can steal people through dreams wants Cat and claims that they are married(view spoiler)[ because he kidnapped her when she was 16 and bounded himself to her before Mencheres caught and imprisoned him.(hide spoiler)]They did everything they could but the guy Gregor refused to give up, sent lots of people after them to kill Bones and capture Cat.(view spoiler)[ He planned on turning her into a vampire Ghoul so he could control her powers as her seir, but Bones bested him and turned her into a vampire and became her seir(hide spoiler)]Bones and Gregor entered a duel to the death and the winner can claim Cat, but before the fight Gregor kidnapped Cat's mother(view spoiler)[ then turned her into a vampire(hide spoiler)]. Bones won the duel but Gregor's allies hate them now and will try to kill them when they get the chance.Will defintely edit this review someday, there's a lot more I'd love to add.
