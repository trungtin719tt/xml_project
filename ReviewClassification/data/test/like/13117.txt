Keep in mind this book was published in 2001, so some things seem outdated and odd having a friendship of girls without them attached to a cell phone.These four girls were thrown together because their moms were in an exercise group together and born within weeks of each other. They attend different school so summer is their bonding and catching up time only this time three will leave home.Tibby is called the rebel but will remain home this summer working as a clerk in a retail store and then she befriends Bailey and gets in tune with her sensitive side. Bridget is the athlete who must not only tame her competitive streak on the field but her sexy attitude which hurts her in the end. Carmen has the bad temper and one action costs her more than money. Last is Lena is the beauty but only feels shy and unsure of herself.Carmen on a whim buys a pair of jeans at a thrift store and forgets about them. On the night before they leave they all try them on and each one gets a perfect fit. This is when they make the pact to each wear the pants, do some profound in them and mail them on to the next person.This is a fast read where you can just read and let the story take you where it takes you. At the end of summer they are back together celebrating birthdays and the new school year. Each has grown and changed but they are still best friends.
