Reread: April/May 2017WHY. DO. I. DO. THIS. TO. MYSELF.Honestly, I'm terrified forTower of Dawnbecause, hell, if it all went to crap at the end ofEmpire of Storms, what on earth are Chaol and Nesryn dealing with in the Southern continents? I am dying to find out, but also too scared. Hulp.I shall go mourn my babies now.After reading:I am dead.Basically, Maas is the reason I have trust issues when it comes to book. She is too skilled at ripping my heart out of my chest, beating it up, cutting it to pieces, setting it on fire and then shoving the ashes of it down my throat.THANK YOU FOR THE FEELS.Dear Maas,I need this. Now.No pressure.
