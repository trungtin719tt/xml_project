Reading this book for the first time (as a teenager) was a magical experience for me. It was the first time I had ever been so deeply submerged in a book that I literally felt dazed and disoriented when it ended and I had to return to reality. They were so real for me--Ash and Juli, Wally and Zarin, Biju Ram and Hira Lal. Leaving their world--leaving India--at the end of the book was painful.The story is about Ashton Pelham-Martyn, English by birth but born in India. He spends his childhood believing he is Indian, and only finds out the truth when he's eleven. This is when the person that he thought he was is separated into two distinct people. One is his traditional English persona which is forced on him in his later childhood, and the other is Ashok, the person he was in his earliest memories of himself. Ash's journey to self-realization is a torturous one, and encompasses the full spectrum of human experience: love, friendship, loyalty, responsibility, despicable acts of cowardice and treachery, and acts of incredible heroism.Toward the end of the book is a battle scene based on a real historic event. Usually I find protracted battle scenes tedious, but this time . . . this time, I was completely caught up in it. I was THERE with Wally, and every desperate sortie, every stratagem, and every loss tore my heart out. I have never read another battle scene since which captivated me as this one did. This book is storytelling at its grandest. It doesn't hurt that Kaye constructs sentences designed to thrill an English teacher's heart, so smoothly and effortlessly do they flow. If you have not yet experienced this epic tale, what are you waiting for?
