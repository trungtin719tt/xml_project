More like 3 and a half. I did enjoy this one but it felt a little disjointed than the other books in the series. Aphrodite as always remains my favorite. Yet it was only in the last ten chapters that we finally made the journey to the Otherworld so it felt just a tad rushed. I will miss Heath....sort of. I know he gets...reincarnated or something, I can see that now. But it was truly nice to revisit this book. My memory of Burned and the books following them is a little hazy (I stopped for some reason at Hidden). Yet I'm going to enjoy finishing this series....and revisiting it.
