Scott Westerfield has a tallent that I enjoy as equally as it annoys me- he can change my mind like a remote control! At the end of the first book in this series, Uglies, I thought that it was the end of the world and that the next book couldn't possibly go the way I wanted it to go! But as I read Pretties, I found that what I had so stubbornly wanted while reading the first book dissolved and I suddenly wanted something else. At the end of this book the feeling of "Oh no! It's the end of the world!" was even more strong than it had been at the end of the first book and what I want is even more solid this time than what I wanted in Uglies was. I'm almost afraid to read the next book, Specials, because I know that he's going to manage to change my mind again, but I don't want my mind to change! That's the masterpiece of it- I'm feeling with each book the same way that the main character, Tally, is feeling. She doesn't want her mind to change, and when it does it seems like the end of the world, until she is used to it and her desires change. Masterful! Masterful! I wonder if he meant to write it that way!Before begining the series, my Sister-in-law warned me that she did't like who Tally ends up with in the end (as a romantic partner), and I thought that I could trick myself into wanting her to end up with "the wrong guy" so that I would be happy with the end of the book, but with the way things are going, it looks like my little scheme backfired and I made myself like the "right guy" instead of the "wrong guy", who she's probably going to end up with. Oh good grief! It's exhausting, trying to beat the system. Yet another thing that makes me feel like I'm one of the characters in the book.
