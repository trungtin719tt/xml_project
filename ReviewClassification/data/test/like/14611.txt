EMOTIONALLY EVOCATIVE LOVE STORYMy only regret is that this novel was not longer. It is one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever read, and Romance is not one of my favorite genres in contemporary literature. With an economy of words, Waller says much, and there is much emotion to be felt via the two protagonists. Because of its brevity, I will not say any more for fear of creating spoilers, which would be doing a great disservice to this splendid tale.Read it! You will be glad you did.Phyllis Eisenstadt
