I need MORE stars, many more stars. Wow, what a book. My heart started beating double time from the first page until the last. And, again, a HUGE cliff hanger. First, I'll address what I didn't like about this book. Each chapter is entitled either Then or Now. It goes back and forth between the past and present. Normally I might not mind this so much but the entire book is so darn intense. Each chapter has so much going on and since you are dealing with two different times and each one has huge events happening that you are freaking out trying to deal with both scenarios at the same time. I though my mind was going to implode.Lena has gotten over the fence and she runs. She runs, walks, and crawls through the forest of the Wilds until finally someone finds her and nurses her back to health. Not only is she weak and sick from her escape, she is grieving for Alex. She is told that he didn't make it, that he was killed during the escape. So the book swings back and forth from her time in the Wilds, introducing you to Raven, the leader of the little group in the Wilds, and to the present time when she and Raven and another member of their group, Tack, are in New York, with fake identities, as members of the resistance.As I said before, from page one, you are on the edge of your seat. Lauren Oliver has such a way of making me feel everything. Lena's grief for Alex was so real to me. I was overwhelmed with sadness for her. And, Lena is so brave. She acts first, thinks later. I am so proud of her. I literally could not rest until I finished the final page. But now, with the cliff hanger, I have to get right on starting the final book. Fantastic, Fantastic Book!!!
