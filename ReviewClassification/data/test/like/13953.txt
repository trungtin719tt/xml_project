A beautifully written and heartbreaking story of a cognitive psychology professor who is diagnosed with early on-set Alzheimer's disease (at age 50). Dr. Alice Howland loves her job at Harvard University, she loves to run and travel, and she loves her husband and her three grown children. One day when she goes out for a run, she becomes confused and panicky after she doesn't recognize the street she's running on, even though she's lived in that area of downtown Boston for many years. Alice becomes fearful that something is medically wrong with her. I have recently watched the film and I think Julianne Moore did a brilliant job portraying Alice (she won an Oscar for it, rightfully so). I also felt the movie stayed faithful to the novel. Of course there was some small changes but nothing that really bothered me. I recommend reading "Still Alice" and then viewing the film afterwards. The novel is full of emotion. I loved the way Lisa Genova described a delicate and yet honest account of a woman who loses everything she has worked for to a cruel disease. This is a tearjerker, but it's not melodramatic or schmaltzy. I highly recommend it. Enjoy!
