[4 Stars] I don't love Anna as much as I love Mercy, but this was a pretty good first book! I definitely think you need to read the novella Alpha and Omega first, so make sure you do that before jumping into this one. I admit, the beginning of this book had me a little wary of Charles and Anna's relationship. Charles is pretty possessive, but that definitely let up in the second half of the book substantially. I actually loved the second half of the book, particularly everything we got to know about Asil and Bran. They are both such fascinating characters, especially considering how old they both are and how Asil actually used to practice Islam. I wonder if that will ever factor more into the story! Regardless, a pretty solid first book. I have faith in Patricia Briggs that Charles and Anna's relationship will not make me feel weird in the next books!ETA: One thing I will say however that I forgot to earlier is that I feel like Anna's previous abuse is never really touched upon, and I don't know how I feel about it. Especially considering how much it has effected Anna. At the end of the book it seems almost like it never really happened and all is well, so yeah. Not really sure how I feel about it because I don't really think it was "handled" so to speak.
