This book nearly failed the Bechdel test. There were an equal assortment of men and women, only the men seem to have a lemming like migratory bent, and fly from the nest for some reason or other.Elinor is a blueprint for heroines that are strong. At least we can agree on the fact that most strong heroines in films are indistinguishable from men. But here there cannot be such confusion.I was not immune to the charms of Sense and sensibility. It was very tough for me to read. At least I was now prepared for the style of this classic. I thought that the men in the book were all expendable. In this way, the 19th century seemed like a futuristic society. Eerie but true.
