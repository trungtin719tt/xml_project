This book brings so much childhood memories back. My dad just to read aloud and retell over and over againJules Verne's stories and I'm so grateful for that. It ignited my passion for reading a long time ago, as I learned for the first time that I can travel around the world through books and stories, laying in the warm room.I can still remember the vivid images of my imagination that I had as a child listening to this story and feelings will never fade, I still felt quite emotional rereading this story and joining Mr. Fogg on his journey.Thank you, dad, and that you Mr. Verne for introducing me to the magical world of literature.
