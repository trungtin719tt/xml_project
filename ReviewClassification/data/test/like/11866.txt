Re-read April 11, 2015I loved this novel when I was growing up. Now as an adult, I can detect some of its flaws. I wasn't around during the 60's (the time period in which this novel was set), but surely there had to have been some "code of medical ethics."(view spoiler)[Was it even legal for a doctor to inform the husband of his ADULT wife's terminal illness, while withholding that information from the wife herself?!? Jenny was a mentally sound adult, &amp; she should have been told of her diagnosis upfront &amp; immediately. However, the doctor told Oliver that it was OLIVER'S decision *if* &amp; *when* to tell Jenny that she was dying. Are you f*cking kidding me? It wasn't Oliver's job to inform Jenny that she's dying; it was the DOCTOR'S job. The doctor should have informed her ASAP, prescribed medication to quell her symptoms, &amp; allowed her the opportunity to make medical decisions for herself. The fact that Jenny had to storm into the doctor's office &amp; demand answers b/c she was feeling so poorly (WEEKS after the doctor had already relayed the devastating medical prognosis to Oliver) just infuriates me further. Talk about a breach of patient's rights.(hide spoiler)]This medical faux pas is the reason why I'm deducting 1 star from my rating.Otherwise, I honestly do adore this book. It's such a powerful depiction of Ivy-life &amp; the stark differences between the wealthy "legacy" students &amp; the poorer students (some of whom are the first in their lineage to attend college). And of course, thelove storybetween Oliver &amp; Jenny is timeless.I've had the following quote from this novel memorized since I was 10 years old:"What can you say about a twenty-five-year-old girl who died?That she was beautiful and brilliant. That she loved Mozart and Bach. The Beatles. And me."*4/5 stars*
