This book was written specifically for my 13-year-old self, which apparently is still alive and well inside of me. It has all the elements I grew up loving: wacky names like Salamanca Tree Hiddle and Phoebe Winterbottom, American Indian themes, lush descriptions of country living, spiritual undertones, a little mystery, a little romance, and a missing mother.The missing mother thing was the suckerpunch, of course. It's why I found myself lying in the bathtub in the middle of a Monday afternoon, blubbering my head off during the book's unexpected climactic twist. Every so often I revisit Young Adult novels - or dip into new ones - to tap into those raw feelings of childhood, as direct and undeniable as a baby's wail. I related so completely to Salamanca's hidden longing, her concealed desperation for her mother to return. It triggered so many memories, and spurred me to wonder, What were those first days like after my mom left? What protective burrow of my brain did those memories tunnel into, searching for a secret safety that was not present in my life at the time? Salamanca's journey is achingly sincere, funny and adventurous. She is exactly the personality I would have lived vicariously through in my early adolescence, glad for someone else's words to elicit the feelings I strove my damndest to suppress, despite my father's warnings that "You bottle your feelings up just like your mother; someday you could end up like her."The power of stories lies not only in their construction of identity, but in their ability to evoke feeling - forgotten feelings, stuffed feelings, feelings we thought we succeeded in losing or numbing away. Thank goodness for these unexpected reminders, gifts we receive in solitude, free to experience the fullness of our vulnerability - reconnected to our nakedest, most innocent selves, blubbering in the bathtub.
