Rating 4.5 stars :)Favourite Quote:"I could smell his fear but was intrigued by the other, more alluring scents beneath it. Clover, rain, sun-warmed fields. I leaned toward him, taking in the shape of his lips, the light in his pale green eyes. He wasn't looking at me like I was a freak. His eyes were full of fear and wanting. I wondered what he could see in my eyes".What an incredible debut! Nightshade was a gripping read that will pull readers into it unique and beautiful world full of passion, mystery and romance.Right from page one I was drawn into this complex plot. So much history and plenty of secrets that slowly unravelled. It definitely kept me turning the pages to figure out what the Keeper's were hiding.The characters from Nightshade are well crafted. Calla is a strong, smart, genuine and loyal. You have to admire her strenght. She had many hard decisions but she always choose to do the right thing. Not only will you adore Calla but also the entertaining bunch of secondary characters like Ansel, Mason, Bryn and Dax. They bring some funnier moments to this intense story.Let's get to the romance. One word for it DELICIOUS! This love triangle actually worked. Both Shay and Ren were just as strong characters as each other and you could understand Calla's confusion. But I am so team Ren. He was just sexy as hell and I am crushing on him big time. Although I have a funny feeling he is not going to end up with the girl and I might have to write an email to Andrea Cremer begging her to make sure Calla picks him.Now the ending...talk about major cliffhanger. On a rating of 1 to 10. Definitely a 10. Why do authors do that to us and then make us wait for forever for the sequel. It drives me crazy. Thankfully Cremer is releasing Wolfsbane on 12th July, 2011. So only 8 months instead of the usual 1 year and it can't come soon enough! I really need more.Overall, Nightshade lived up to all the hype and is one of the best paranormal romance reads of the year!
