Not as much a book as a reading experience, Kazantzakis's Zorba is the quintessential novel of a normal person coming into contact with an explosively hilarious bigger-than-life character - Zorba! It is engaging, funny, touching and extremely entertaining. Of course, many have seen the classic film made from it, but seriously, the book is really quite extraordinary. Perhaps the greatest novel among many great books by this under appreciated Greek writer.
