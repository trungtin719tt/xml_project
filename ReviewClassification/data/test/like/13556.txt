"Tender is the Night" is an interesting dinner guest that arrives half-drunk seems amusing but shallow, but then, as the night wears on, reveals itself as something deep, thoughtful, and yes, even tender.It's the story of one couple -- Dick and Nicole Diver; a charismatic American family living in France. They are charming, they are exceptional, they are fun, and of course, they are also flawed...and their tale is tragic. In short, this book is a classic and a joy to read.I'm always cautious about commenting on male writers writing female characters, especially those with mental disorders. But Nicole seems sympathetically and miraculously well-developed. Even though she is a kind of plague to the charismatic Dick Diver (I wonder what Freud would say about this character name), she also is a charming delight -- which makes Dick's situation all the more plausible and relatable. As the novel moves into its mature parts, we see that Dick himself is a kind of blight on Nicole. As Nicole gets better mentally and emotionally, Dick goes through a kind of dissipation.The very period-ness of the book, post-WWI Europe, the Jazz age, the backdrop of a rising and confident America, also makes the book interesting. In the edition I read, there are numbered references you can look up in the back that explain all the period details. The book is very much a work of its time, and thus, it's also a fascinating window into that part of history. One of the things that stands out the most is spectacular wealth that the Divers enjoy in their pre-Great Depression era lives. This is a subject I think that should resonate with modern America readers!The book was serialized (either in a newspaper or magazine, I forget), so the chapters are short, punchy, and something interesting happens in all of them. Since I read much of this on the bus to work, this structure of the book really worked for me.At first, as I read the book, I took it as just another well-written period piece. But the more involved I became with the Dick and Nicole, the more I began to see this book not just as a good work of fiction, but as a great one. It's the tale of a complicated time and place where good things can easily go sour.I would recommend this book to all lovers of great fiction! And, for this reason, I'm placing it on my all-time greats bookshelf.
