Sometimes the universe justwantsyou to read a book. A few months ago, Wired Magazine ran a feature onGeek Love at 25, an anniversary reflection of sorts. I'm not sure if that is why my book-club cohort picked the book or if it was just in the air for another reason, but not long after, it became the official pick for May.The article points out that this was an important book cover design for Chip Kidd, who went on to become the best known book cover designer of recent times.I'd seen this book before, and assumed it would be some love story about characters in the margins, pocket protectors and LARPers. Well, I was half right."Like the mucoid nubbin that spins a shell called 'oyster,' we Binewskis wove a midway shelter called 'carnival.'"The reader of this novel discovers very quickly that geek is used in the second definition of the word - the circus performer, circus freak, carnival freak, not the main tent but the sideshow.The story goes that the Binewskis fell in love as circus performers but in marriage saw an opportunity to magnify the geek experience. Under her husband Al's direction, Lil takes extreme drugs and chemicals into her body during pregnancy, and gives birth to siamese twins, an albino hairless dwarf with a hump, a child with flippers instead of limbs, and one more child that lives. The novel is the story of the family, starting and ending with Olympia, the albino dwarf child who narrates most of the story.I kept thinking ofInfinite Jestwhich would have been published seven years later, but may have been influenced by this novel, which was quite popular in the circles of the early 90s non-pop, alternative, pop culture icons. I could picture the Binewskis menagerie of genetic "modification" fitting into the deformed children that live in the society of Wallace's near future world, while not being his main focus. The obsessiveness of Dunn's characters also would have fit well into that world.I realize not everyone has read Infinite Jest so I'll talk more about the actual book. The tone is incredibly dark. The lengths the characters go to for what they want continued to shock and disgust me, yet I kept reading because I was fascinated and horrified and couldn't look away. There are not any good people here. They are flawed, inside and out. I can't think of anything else like it.The pull isn't just the characters and ideas but the writing. Dunn has a way with words!When the children are young, Dunn uses that opportunity to reflect on the evil nature of babies. I think this part might be what I remember most years from now:"It is, I suppose, the common grief of children at having to protect their parents from reality. It is bitter for the young to see what awful innocence adults grow into, that terrible vulnerability that must be sheltered from the rodent mire of childhood...How deep and sticky is the darkness of childhood, how rigid the blades of infant evil, which is unadulterated, unrestrained by the convenient cushions of age and its civilizing anesthesia."And it's true. In Geek Love, the children do terrible, horrible things. You've been warned. The flipper boy character, Arty, is probably the most interesting-disturbing presence. Or is he just the product of his environment?Some of the story is told by Oly as an adult, where she reflects on the benefits of being outwardly and obviously different."Just being visible is my biggest confession, so they try to set me at ease by revealing our equality, by dragging out their own less apparent deformities.... They tell me everything eventually."I should say that in Geek Love, people outside the family are labeled "Norms" and are usually disregarded. Norms are boring, and lack the special qualities of the family members!And the Binewski's love/hate the norms. When one of the conjoined twins falls in love for the first time, she only can love the norm boy until he loves her back."...If he comes to loving me it's because I've twisted him and changed him. If he loves me he's corrupted. I can't love him anymore. I won't pretend it didn't hurt."And then later, a similar sentiment from Oly..."I have certainly mourned for myself. I have wallowed in grief for the lonesome, deliberate seep of my love into the air like the smell of uneaten popcorn greening to rubbery staleness. In the end I would always pull up with a sense of glory, that loving is the strong side. It's feeble to be an object."This book won't be for everyone, but that's what makes it so great. She doesn't sugarcoat or temper anything, and it's in her willingness to go to an extreme where the beauty lies. But Dunn already knew she didn't fit as a norm!Discussed on Episode 5 of theReading Envy podcast!
