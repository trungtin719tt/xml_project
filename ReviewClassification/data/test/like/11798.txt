After finishingMessage in a Bottle, I am completely speechless. I was unable to put the book down and so eager to continue to learn what will happen next. Nicholas Sparks is my favorite author and after reading this book, I'd say this is his most touching novel I've read so far. A woman, Theresa, is recovering from a divorce. One day, while she was on the beach, she finds something that'll change her life forever. She sees a bottle with something inside--it's a letter. She reads it and tears begin to fall because the person who wrote this letter really loved his significant other. This someone was Garrett. After many events, Theresa and Garrett meet and they develop something so beautiful. Theresa is falling for Garrett but she's still protecting herself from getting hurt because she knows Garrett isn't over his wife, Catherine, who died 3 years ago. Theresa had 3 letters Garrett wrote and he found them. They end up having a big argument and Garrett leaves. Theresa went down and they decided to end their relationship because things aren't working out. Sparks writes in 3rd person omniscient and readers can see that they both don't want to end like this. The ending is the best part and you'll have to read it to feel it. This novel has emphasized how important your significant other is, how it'll feel to loose them, but most importantly, to always keep and love them with all your heart. Nicholas Sparks was able to make me see another side of love. I'd recommend this book to everyone because it's a really great book. This book was powerful enough to make me tear up.
