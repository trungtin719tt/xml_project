What else can I say? I enjoyed all these three books included inThe Lord of the Rings(5 STARS),(5 STARS) and now(5 STARS).It has the most tight interesting plot, memorable characters and universal unending theme:the triumph of good over evil.In fact, in the closing scene of the book, Frodo gives the book he wrote to Sam, the world's greatest gardener. The title of the book isThe Downfall of the Lord of the Rings and the Return of the King. The "lord" refers to the evil king Sauron whose disappears in the wind when the ring falls to the Mount of Doom together with Gollum and the "king" refers to Aragorn who comes back as the rightful heir of the king's throne in Minas Tirith, the city capital of Gondor.No matter in which race, nationality and religion you belong, it is always nice to know that the good persists in the end. The hobbits belong to the powerless race. The elves, dwarves and men in Tolkien's Middle-Earth have all the special powers, skills or natural physique and they helped the hobbits in defeating the evil Sauron and the traitor Saruman. However, if you really think about it, maybe more than half of the effort was contributed byFrodo Baggins(whose sacrifice was both internal and external as he fights the demon that tempts him to use the ring for selfish end),Samwise "Sam" Gamgee(for taking care of Frodo and for being an interim ring-bearer when Frodo was bitten by Shelob),Peregrine "Pippin" Took(for his presence of mind in throwing the elven brooch so Aragorn would find him and his cousin and also for killing the troll officer during the final battle at the Mouth of Sauron) and lastly Pippin's bestfriend and cousin,Meriadoc "Merry" Brandybuck(said to be the most intelligent Hobbit who figured out the password to the cave of Moria and for killing Nazgul fulfilling the prophecy that the latter would be killed not by a man. Merry was knighted by King Eomer as the Knight of the Mark).I mean, they are all small creatures, between 2 and 4 feet in height, they don't have special skills and yet they persisted. They are the main heroes of this book. How about us who are more than 4, 5, 6 feet? They are really inspiring, right?It took me 3 days to finish this book but I spent 5 days reading the very interesting although densely printed appendices. The Numeroneans (Appendix A) are very interesting because it traces the history of Middle-Earth from the first king to the start of the LOTR including the love story of Aragorn and Arwen who marry each other when Aragorn is made king of Gondor at the end of Book 3. Appendix B is useful if you want to know the chronology of Middle-Earth events and you don't have the time to read the long narrative texts. Appendix C has the multi-layered family trees. Appendix D has the Shire Calendar, Appendix E, their language and spelling and Appendix F has the language of the people of the Third Age. I mean, for a low-profile Oxford professor to come out with all details regarding Middle-Earth, it's just unthinkable and something that has been not been duplicated since then, right?I am still in awe while writing this review. I cannot stop admiring this book. I can go on and on but I don't want to bore you. Just take my word for it: if you don't like fantasy genre because you perceive it as shallow and juvenile, try this. This is the fantasy book that does not insult your intelligence. It is entertaining and bewildering. Unforgettable read.
