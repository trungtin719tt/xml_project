Well, I've come to the end of the road once more... This was my tenth reading of Tolkien's saga of Middle Earth (the first time I visited was in 1986) and it's pointless trying to write a balanced review of my favourite books. Suffice it to say that these books are a part of me; written into my DNA, if you like, and I love them dearly.I'll be back in a year or two, Bagginses, to do it all over again...Buddy read with Sunshine Seaspray.-------------------------------------------------And I did come back! As I will again and again and again... You'll have to excuse me now, as I'm definitely not crying... You see, I'm wounded... and it will never really heal...(2nd June 2017)
