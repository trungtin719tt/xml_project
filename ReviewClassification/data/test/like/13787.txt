Hotel New Hampshire is that book for me. That one great book. It makes me want to go back to any other book I rated with 5 stars and lower them down at least one - because surely they do not compare to this one.It's impossible to summarize Hotel New Hampshire and have it make sense to someone who has either not read it, or not read anything else by Irving. It contains bears, little people, taxidermy and radicals. The story has many fantastical elements - but at the core of this novel is a story about a family and how it endures. Irving will spend pages describing simple things, yet major events that take place last but a sentence or two. I've re-read this book several times now, and with each reading I discover new layers of the story.Beyond this - it is difficult for me to make sense of what to write about this book to entice someone to read it - yet not give away any gems that one will discover upon reading it. I will say this - if you are able to read this book and take the lighthearted moments with a smile and the more serious moments with some thought - you will undoubtedly enjoy this book.So we dream on - thus we invent our lives.
