This set of scriptures is the best way to learn about the core beliefs of the members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (aka the Mormons). This book, like the Holy Bible, help us to learn more about our Savior, Jesus Christ and his mission and role in our Heavenly Fathers Plan of Salvation as well as in our own lives. This book, coupled with prayer, will help, as Joseph Smith Jr. said, any person grow closer to Christ as well as better come to know him.As I continually read and reread this book, it helps be to better become a disciple of Christ and strive to live a better and happier life. After I read this book, through sincere pray and asking God if this book was really true, I came to find out for myself, through the Holy Ghost, that this book is true and was written and prepared by ancient prophets of God for us.I would recommend this book to everyone and would be willing to discuss or answer any questions that someone might have.
