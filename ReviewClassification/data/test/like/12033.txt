Actual rating 4.5 StarsI liked Cinder, it wasn't anything magical or something that really stood out to me, it was just okay. However Scarlet the second book in The Lunar Chronicles has made me think again. I honestly really liked this book, I liked the new characters. I can't even decide between Scarlet, Wolf and Thorne because they al bring something different to the plot.The building of the story progressed really well, I was curious as to how these two stories would entwine, but it was apparent quite early(ish) on. I thought it was really clever how they described Scarlet, with the Red Hoody, her companion is wolf and when she went to watch a fight they were called Hunter. Little attention to detail like this made me really happy and just think of the story that this once was.I honestly think I preferred Scarlet and Wolfs story rather than Cinder and Thornes, although later on in the later chapters I did enjoy this. Thorne was an added bonus to the story, I always like some form of light heartedness and that comes perfectly with this cheeky character.I'm looking forward to continuing on with he series, the ending of this book has set up the next book perfectly.Wolf are you...going to ask me to be you alpha female?Swoooooooon, Swoon, Swoon.Wolf is my fave, there I said it.Reviews:Cinder- 4Scarlet- 4.5Cress- 4.5Winter- 5
