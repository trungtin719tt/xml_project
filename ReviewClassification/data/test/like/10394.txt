I appreciate the nuances of a McCarthy novel: his voice, the settings, the very real characters he conjures within that mind of his. But the one thing I cannot accept is when people say he only writes westerns. His books cannot be categorized with such a simple claim. NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN is a perfect example. Sure, McCarthy uses some sterotypes (easy-going sheriff, bumbling hero, and creepy psychopath) to tell his story, but he uses them in ways that few writers can--McCarthy breaths life into his characters, gives them substance. He paints with his words a world fully realized; even with a sparse writing style (in most of his books) readers are subjected to a canvas that is multilayered, complex, and unique. If you've seen the Coen brothers movie of this novel you already know how creepy Anton Chigurh is; the book paints him much creepier. In a nutshell: if this is just a western where a man comes across some loot that doesn't belong to him, and then more men want what he has and they send a very bad dude after the man with the loot, then THE OLD MAN AND THE SEA is just a story about an old guy fishing. Layers, my friends, layers. Read the book. Then go out and read the rest of Cormac McCarthy's novels. You won't be sorry. Trust me, what have you got to lose?VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
