Fame is a form--perhaps the worst form--of incomprehension.I can recall the first time I discovered the name Borges. That marks a near singular occasion. It was 1990 and I was thoroughly enjoying my Philosophy of Religion course and curious about nihilism. This engendered another retreat to the library and there on the opening page of some text was a quotation from this strange figure. It was a few minutes later when I had culled a number of texts from stacks. Like many a reader and a number of Borges characters, I was never the same. A purchase of Labyrinths was soon to follow.Over the years I've maintained an intimacy with many of the stories in the Collected Fictions. Some tales like Pierre Menard and The Aleph I must have read 15-20 times in my life. This reading was thus a wonderful opportunity to discover such jewels as Emma Zunz. While I've maintained my love for such episodes as Death and the Compass (see the film starring Peter Brook) I have cultivated an affection for the subtle Borges, the gnawing uneasiness which is both philosophical and all-too-human.There were certainly times poring over these abstracts of imagined books when I not only felt like an illiterate swindler but also that the text would never cease, both like the Book of Sand as well a paged equivalent of the Blue Tiger, forever multiplying in my grasp, like some curse of abundance. Maybe one day I'll relax on a park bench and find adjacent that 20 year old undergraduate, wild eyed about The Library of Babel: what should I say?
