This is only the second time that I read Death on the Nile. I remember the sublime subterfuge of the guilty party, but thought there were only two deaths in the book. In fact there are five deaths and the book has a quite hectic pace.Hercule Poirot refers to previous cases once or twice. In Murder of the Orient Express he absolved the guilty completely. In Death on the Nile, he regrets bringing the murderer to justice, but carries out this task still.The boat on the Nile houses many other characters who serve to camouflage the murderers. Investigation is carried out by Poirot and his temporary sidekick Colonel Race. There is some romance, and there is some sadness in the final revelation. I really enjoyed the book for there is no other book like it. The author was brilliant in imagining this setting. An unconditional 5 stars from me.
