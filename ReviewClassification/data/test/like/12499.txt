My first ever Austen book! I feel so accomplished right now, I probably wont do anything for the rest of the day.I really liked the writing, it kept me invested and interested in the story. When the story itself was a bit slow. I also really enjoyed the characters, most of all the sisters and Mrs. Jennings. The humor was definitely one of my favorite things about the book. It would appear when I least expected it, and was often in the form of passive aggressive conversations. Which I LOVED reading!
