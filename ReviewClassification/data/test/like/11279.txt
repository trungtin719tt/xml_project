Reread in October 2018As always, amazing writing and stories that make you think. Gotta love Gilman, not only for her talent of writing, but her courage to write such feminist pieces during the 18th century._____________________________________________5 STARSI only had to readThe Yellow Wallpaperfor class, however, as soon as I read that short-story, I knew I wouldhaveto read her other stories. Gilman's writing isflawless. I honestly think Charlotte Perkins Gilman is my new favorite short-story author, ever. Her unique ideas and effortless writing, is really something. I mean, she literally has me feeling sorry for the characters in under 10 pages -- that's talent.Overall,this is brilliant! I'll come back to this later and write a proper review when I have more time. For now, I highly recommend YOU (whoever might be reading this) readThe Yellow Wallpaper, because that's honestly the best short-story I've read all year!
