Madeleine L'Engle used to be my favorite author until I realized she had passed away before I could send her a letter telling her how much I loved her. She really is (as said on the box) a "master of fantasy". All four of these books (especiallyA Wrinkle in TimeandMany Waters) are genius in the way they are set up, exhibited, and closed. I saw a Ring of Endless light on the Disney channel (yeah, I used to watch those every time a new one came on) and I loved it. She's a lovely writer.
