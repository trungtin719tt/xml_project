Oh man. This book brings me back to the days of high school, summer camp, and having little crushes. Seriously, this embodies adolescence through the eyes of four teenage girls that are best friends. I found that this book still stands up to everything I love about a book today. Please, if you have not read this book, give it a chance. It is witty, heartbreaking, and insightful.
