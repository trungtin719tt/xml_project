Wow! This one was unlike any of the others in the BDB series. It didn't focus so much on the romance between the H/H (Phury and Cormia), as the other books in the series did, and at first I missed that. This was more about Phury coming to grips with his past, and his ability to finally forgive himself and allow himself the freedom to love and be loved. It was also heart wrenching at times to watch Phury battle with his drug addiction, which he had for (hundreds!) of years! At times Phury's self destructiveness and hero complex did grate on my nerves, but at least the author took the time to reveal his heartbreaking back-story, so I could see the motivations for his actions. And when Phury finally got his act together and allowed himself to accept Cormia's love, it was a beautiful moment and brought tears to my eyes.This was also a transitional book, setting in motion what is to come later in the series, with not many plot points being resolved. The plot about the future BDB brothers, John Matthew, Qhuinn, and Blay, and their close friendship, was especially interesting to me. Qhuinn's horrible treatment by his family, was especially disturbing and sad. (They shunned him due to his mismatched eyes? (One blue, one green) Haven't they ever heard of David Bowie? lol! And the friendship that blooms between Blay and Qhuinn reminded me much of V and Butch, but went much farther than theirs went. I am curious to see how far sexually the author is going to take this friendship.John Matthew continues to have a fascination with the mysterious Xhex, but we only learn just a little bit more about her. Obviously more will be revealed in a future book.And thankfully, a person very important from John Matthew's past makes a somewhat suprising return, brought back by a mysterious fallen angel. (once again--future book)And the sympath Rehvenge gets a fair amount of mention in this book. The 'creature/princess' thing/person he is being blackmailed by I found really creepy yet intriguing. Once again, just enough to whet your appetite for a future book.There is also a not so suprising revelation of who is the son of the villianous Omega. I think I saw this one coming, but the future war between the Omega's son and the Brotherhood will continue on in the following books, I'm sure.Finally, a few of the things that I would have liked to see but were not in the book: more on the other brothers and their shellans! Although Zsadist and Bella were featured a little (mainly in a storyline regarding the birth of their child), and Wrath had a few moments, the others were barely mentioned. Doc Jane made a few 'ghostly' appearances--but only to do some 'doctoring'. Beth made one brief appearance. No sign of Mary or Marissa. Butch, V, and Rhage had token appearances. I would have loved a page or two just to see what they were all up to. But that's a minor quibble. Even though this was not the most romantic or exciting of the BDB series, this was a worthwhile book, bringing to light the future direction of the series. And I find J.R. Ward's writing style so exceptional, she could write a phone book and I would probably find it interesting! I would give "Lover Enshrined" 4 1/2 stars, and I will definitely look forward to more in this exciting series!
