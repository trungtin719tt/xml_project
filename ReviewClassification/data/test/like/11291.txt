What an incredible collection of stories! All were beautifully written. Some were sweet and a bit romantic. Some ended abruptly making me want a sequel. But it is the title story I loved most. It felt a bit like an Edgar Allen Poe story. I was reminded especially ofThe Cask of Amontillado, which I have always found the most shocking, scary, and realistic of his tales. It was horror in the modern sense, but was so much scarier than anything modern because it was believable.
