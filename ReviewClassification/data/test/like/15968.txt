I'm not a Romance novel kind of guy. But this is not a "Romance" novel, at least in my sense of the definition (not that there is anything wrong with that genre). However, regardless, and whatever, this was an extremely well written suspenseful thriller with some love sprinkles. And a little magic as well. And really after you get started with this one it's hard to put down. I will forever look at Nicholas Sparks novels with a completely different attitude and respect (not that there is anything wrong with romance novels. Did I say that already? Because I'm almost sure I mean it). :-)
