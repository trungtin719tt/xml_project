Note: OMG the ending, God the ending kills man, you've got to read this blah blah blah. Love it I need the next book right now!Book Review for Iron Daughter by Julie Kagawa(Ray William Johnson Style)Note: Ray William Johnson is one of my fave vloggers on Youtube. His videos are called Equals Three or =3 and he's *bleep sound* funny, need I say more?What's Happening Forum?Guys now I'm going to review this book and yeah let's use pros and cons to make it a teensy bit organize...shall we?Cool TransitionPros:1. Okay the Unseelie Court was super bad-ass.2. Queen Mab was super bad-ass, seriously.3. The two other Unseelie Prince were super duper hawt. Though Sage died like pretty fast and I was like OMG Sage's dead, what the *bleep sound* !4. The Queen of the Exiles Lea was super bad-ass (the *bleep sound* with this word? Is this the word of the day or something?).5. THE IRON HORSE AND GRIMALKIN WAS *BLEEP SOUND* FUNNY.6. Puck was *bleep sound* funny and super bad-ass.(why the *bleep sound* is this review so retarded?)7. It got me surprised that tuuuuut is Meghan's tuuuuuut and it was like Holy *bleep sound* Christ Geezus! ***Using My Ray William Johnson Voice*** (That really got me blindsided there in a major way and I love that when I think about it, Kagawa gave subtle foreshadowing on it but still when that came out, I was really surpised about it...sorry I'm a blabber)8. The Meghann, Ash and Puck teen love drama was *bleep sound* hilarious. (Is this a *bleep sound* comedy or something)Now on with the bad stuffCool TransitionCons1. Another *bleep sound* Twilight rip-off crap wanna be...Is it just me or there we go again with the *bleep sound* similarities...Meghan= BellaAsh= EdwardPuck= JacobCome on! This becoming so *bleep sound* annoying and old already! (Using My Bella Swan Whiny Voice)2. Meghan is *bleep sound* ANNOYING BITCH...I *bleep sound* hate her...Why the hell these guys falling head over heels on this girl...she's just soooooooo can I say *BLEEP SOUND* IRRITATING AND SELFISH.3. Meghan and Ash's relationship felt contrived. It is abrupt and like there's no reason at all why the *bleep sound* they love each other. It's like it's just there for the sake of a bad-ass Romeo and Juliet like Romance. But it is unrealistic and unbelievable.4. Meghan don't *bleep sound* deserve Puck! Seriously he's your best friend and you're just using him and manipulating his feelings. You don't deserve him AT ALL!Cool TransitionSo much for the drama...But you know what's cooler than this review?
