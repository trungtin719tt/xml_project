Rating: 4* of fiveGorgeous book, both physically and in content. I was riveted from first to last, and completely bought into the premise: A privately financed interstellar journey never seemed nore likely than in the world Russell posits is coming from our own era.Beautiful, beautiful writing! The descriptions of Rukhat are spare and evoked so much for me. The descriptions of Earth's near-enough future were pitch-perfect to my ears as well, though a lot less beautiful in the images they left behind.The disquieting images of the near future, and the horrible fate of Emilio (the main character), are inextricably linked in my mind with Russell's richly drawn alien culture and its customs. I was frustrated by the subordinate characters' incompleteness, and then the aliens' glancing treatment; but that really points up the good quality of the writing! I wanted more than Russell gave me, of everything she gave me, and it's not very often one gets to say that about a first novel.
