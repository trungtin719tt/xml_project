Anne Lindbergh spent two weeks on Captiva Island in Florida, one week alone and one week with her sister, reflecting on her life and relationships. She uses five shells found on the beach to symbolize her ideas. She felt that women should try to simplify their lives. Find time for solitude, creativity, and an inner life. Have time alone with your spouse and each child for "one-and-only moments". Find balance between obligations to your family and your community, and time for inner harmony.Relationships have ebbs and flows like the tide, and peaks and troughs like the waves. Three of her shells represented different phases in relationships, especially marriage, as people go through life. Enjoy the present, find the joy and peace in the here and now.This lovely slim volume written in 1955 was partly memoir, and partly an inspirational group of essays. The author was a wife and mother during my grandmother's and my mother's generations. It made me wonder what Anne Lindbergh would think about the world today where my daughters' generation is bombarded with information and new devices constantly. Perhaps today's woman has even more need to nurture an inner life as this book suggests.
