I'm being irreverent, but whenever I think of this work I cannot help recalling Mel Brooks in History of the World Part 1.Apart from the legendary, and infamous, incest, this is an ancient tale of psychological terror and angst. Human nature does not change and the themes Sophocles explored are still relevant today, this is truly a timeless work.
