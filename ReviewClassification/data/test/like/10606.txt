This is not a noir style detective story set in a big city underworld. This is a fun romp set in a Thatcherless Britain complete with time travel, genetically resurrected dodo birds, a Crimeean War that has been going on for more than 100 years, huge zeppelins instead of planes, crazy inventor uncles and lost in time fathers, street gangs made of bookclub members fighting for the good name of their favorite author, costume opera archenemies and about 30 secret police organizations. One of them is in charge of literary forgeries and our heroine is an agent curiously named Thursday Next, a spunky thirty something specializing in 19th century novels, sport cars, guns, pet dodos and piano playing.The plot is more like a spoof of crime genre where the bad guy has dark designs on the characters from Jane Eyre novels and one of the most pressing questions of the day is who really wrote Shakespeare's plays.I'm looking forward to the next Next adventure.
