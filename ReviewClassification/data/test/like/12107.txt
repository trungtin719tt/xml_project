I think this may be my favorite Shannon Hale book.The writing style is very much like her other YA books (Goose Girl, Enna Burning, &amp; River Secrets). Also it shares the "speaking" theme.What I love most about Princess Academy is the growth the characters experience. Miri began as a scrawny quarry girl who didn't know her place in the world. She developed into a brave, intellegent girl who knows her heart. The road of growth is deep in plot and emotion which makes of a very meaningful and touching read.Lovely. Shannon Hale is a master of fantasy.
