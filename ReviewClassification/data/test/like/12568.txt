Finally read it!This one was so often interrupted and left for dead... &amp; I guess it was better to keep straining the eyes and pausing after glorious upon glorious sentence for better understanding. Yeah- he's one of those authors often times associated with Greatness, &amp; with good reason."The Return of the Native" is another interrupted and altogether discarded novel which had incredible prospects. This one rollercoasters from Dickensian beginnings (Jude the pauper and dreamer) to omnipresent tragedy (yes--Shakespearean &amp; modern, too).Jude is an Everyman cursed by an even larger figure: the pre-feminist minx. In the case of Jude, being associated to a woman in a then-bizarre two-in-one-ness is The Fatal Flaw. And not just to any woman: Sue Bridehead, a Bovary-ian counterpart, is ambivalent and mean and unromantic. Of course she will singlehandedly betray Jude's affections, break his heart. She is a sad drama queen, &amp; every woman in this novel is an antagonist!There is a downfall to this modest Everyman, sure, and though it is propagated by his unfortunate mistake of falling for a BITCH, there are outside influences which too contribute to the misery that pervades.Jude is an idiot, of course, and the moral is clear, though other themes insert themselves with automatic ambition, themes such as Marriage (this book should be mandatory for anyone studying the rituals of the [dreadful:] lawful union), Christianity, Urban Sprawl, Social Decay, Shattered Dreams, Lowly Expectations.It is a difficult read, and I am happy to put it behind me. It is a sure fire classic, as grand a production as any writer can produce. I will read it again when I have more time &amp; patience... I predict within the next ten-15 years.
