Jonathan Franzen seems to have a knack for winding people up. When hislist of writing ruleswas published a couple of weeks ago, the Internet was quickly ablaze with indignation and evisceration. How dare this privileged snob share such pompous advice? My own Twitter timeline was full of other writers mocking his self-importance.But is it arrogance if you can back it up? I'd never read Franzen's fiction, so I decided to start with the book that made his name. And I soon realised why such a fuss was made of The Corrections. It is a novel bursting with ideas and razor-sharp observations, a work of true ambition and intelligence. Love him or hate him, Franzen is a literary talent that is hard to ignore.The story revolves around the Lamberts, a family from the Midwest town of St Jude, each of them battling their own private demons. Alfred is losing his mind to Parkinson's, as his fussy wife Enid struggles to care for him. Eldest son Gary is trying to convince himself that he is not depressed, as he competes with his wife for his childrens' affection. Middle son Chip has lost his cushy college job after an affair with a student. And beautiful, hard-working Denise is a successful chef who bounces from one failed relationship to another.Stories about dysfunctional families hold a real fascination for me, and boy do the Lamberts have issues. I found the one-upmanship of Gary's marriage riveting and strangely amusing. Alfred's ungraceful demise was tragic to read about, and I felt sorry for Enid as she tried her best to hold everything together. Denise was an intriguing paradox - maybe the most good-hearted and thoughtful member of the Lamberts, but with a self-destructive tendency when it comes to relationships. The lazy, self-serving Chip was the only character I did not care for, and I found myself skimming through his pages.The Corrections is a family saga that is as insightful, witty and genuine as any I've read. But the book is not only concerned with domestic matters, it also holds forth on topics such as the healthcare system, the declining state of American railroads, East European cuisine and so on. I must admit that not all of these tangents held my full attention. However, the story always came back to the Lamberts - as real and as fascinating a fictional family as you could ever come across. The naysayers will continue to call Franzen arrogant, but if he keeps writing books as good as this one, he can show off all he wants.
