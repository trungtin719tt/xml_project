I finished this book in 12 hours. ONE DAY. I finished it in one day. I'm giving it 5 stars because I still can't believe that I, Natasha Polis, finished a book in a day. I've never done that before. Ever. It was so good and so entertaining. Lots of sexytimes, very mature scenes, which I did enjoy but still not heavily detailed which I'm very thankful for. The emotions and tears I felt for and had for Miles really made this book. I can't wait to read another Colleen Hoover book!
