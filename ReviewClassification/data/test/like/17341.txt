Before saying anything else let me say, this book is for everyone. For every age group. No matter how old you are, must read &amp; recall your incidents, because we all have done such things with our mothers &amp; every child can relate with it.This is a story of every mother &amp; every child.This book literally gave me goosebumps.Heart-breaking but beautiful. Truthful yet emotional.Not any difficult phrase, not any lyrical lines but these simple, honest, amazingly written lines had such a profound effect on me, I can't even explain it in words. Tears stood in my eyes.What could be more painful than this,Years later, after her death, I made list of Times My Mother Stood Up for Me and Times I Did Not Stand Up for My Mother. It was sad, the imbalance of it all.'After few paragraphs whenever this line came, I feel revitalize,Times My Mother Stood Up for Me&amp; then few other incidents and something broke inside me every single time,After reading this,Times I Did Not Stand Up for My Mother.Every time I read Mitch Albom, Every time he made me cry. :'(He's simply a brilliant writer.Ending my review with this heart-breaking excerpt. (while reading I felt like sky fell upon me)'I HOPE YOU never hear those words. Your mom. She died. They are different than other words. They are too big to fit in your ears. They belong to some strange, heavy, powerful language that pounds away at the side of you head, a wrecking ball coming at you again and again, until finally, the words crack a hole large enough to fit inside your brain. And in so doing, they split you apart.'
