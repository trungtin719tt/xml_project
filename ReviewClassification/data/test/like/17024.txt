Scintillating biography of the man who changed the world.By firing that bullet into the jugular of the Habsburg heir on that sunny morning in Sarajevo in June 1914, Gavrilo Princip not only killed off the old world, he also unwittingly helped to usher in the modern age - the toxic 20th century with its legacy of revolution, fascism, genocide and totalitarian terror.Tim Butcher is the perfect medium for the telling of this extraordinary tale. Having spent years in the bloody cauldron of the Bosnian war, he was first drawn into the story by witnessing a scene in war-torn Sarajevo. Ordinary people walking into a cemetery chapel to take a shit. Turns out it was Princip's grave. From there, Butcher launches into a beautiful, expansive meditation on the meaning of the First World War, which in turn serves as the launchpad for a real-life journey he undertakes in the summer of 2012 retracing Princip's steps - from the village of Obljaj, the assassin's birthplace in the wild mountains of Herzegovina, all the way to that fateful street corner along the Miljacka river in the centre of modern Sarajevo. Throughout, he interweaves Princip's personal history with the wider history of the Balkans, with his own memories of the Bosnian war, and with the account of his pilgrimage across the region nearly 20 years later. Bosnia today is a country still wracked by the after-spasms of genocide and civil war, just as the world that Princip threw out of kilter never really recovered its equilibrium either.The most powerful passage of all is Butcher's account of the fall of Srebrenica and the infamous massacre of 8000 Bosnian Muslims, all under the noses of hapless UN peacekeepers. He joins thousands of Bosnians on the annual Peace March that commemorates and reenacts in reverse the death march of Srebrenicans who made a desperate dash for safety in July 1995 but all too often ended up signing their own death warrants. This chapter "A Mystical Journey" is doubtless the book's emotional high point, but so clean and powerful and polished is Butcher's prose that the entire book reads like a dream.For anyone even remotely interested in the history of the modern world, this book is essential reading. It is amazing to think that so neglected, so distorted is the true story of Gavrilo Princip - his name as much a cipher as that of his victim the Archduke Franz Ferdinand - that even after a hundred years, Butcher is able to unearth original material on him from archives long forgotten, unknown to all previous chroniclers.For me, personally, WW1 has long held a magnetic fascination, and Sarajevo is one of those mythical cities - like Atlantis and Timbuktu - whose very name is a spell, an invocation, more vivid in the imagination than it is perhaps in reality. On the eve of my first visit to the Balkans - inspired by people as varied as Princip and the Archduke, Christiane Amanpour and Rebecca West and even the ski pair of Torvill and Dean! - on the eve of this glorious, much-awaited, much-anticipated journey to the magic, tragic city of Sarajevo, I could not have chosen to read a better book.
