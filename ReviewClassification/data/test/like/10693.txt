This book is a must read.I am way behind the crowd on getting to this book, only because I've never read an Oprah book pick that I liked. However, this book summarizes things I've always believed. Here are some of my own beliefs that I've been telling people for years (in my own words).All great ideas are "out there" waiting to be discovered. Whomever searches them out first claims them as their own. There is more than enough love, money, knowledge, truth and friendship out there for everyone. There's no reason to limit yourself or others.If I am in tune with my body I know what is wrong and what it needs. My body is capable of healing itself (Jim has always rolled his eyes at this one).If you believe the best for yourself and your family, you will get it. I've always believed that Jim and I will have a great life, and so we do.People that believe they are old and/or sick and in pain end up old and sick and in pain. They've been asking for it for years. So they get it.If you expect (and truly believe) that your kids will do certain things (be obedient, good students, well behaved, go to college, go on missions) they will do them. The same is true for the opposite. Might as well dream big.I chose the life I am leading. It is the life I want. If it wasn't, I would change it.If you believe that you are okay financially and don't complain about being poor, you will be able to have everything you need and want. For several years Jim and I had a combined yearly income of 10K or less. We never felt like we didn't have every thing we needed. We never told anyone we didn't have everything we needed. While we watched (admittedly amused ) as many around us with much greater incomes constantly complained to everyone that would listen how poor they were. We never felt that way...and so we were happy and fine. I know that everyone around us still believes we have much more income than we do....because we believe, as always, that we have plenty. So we do.If you believe that your life is mostly happy and rewarding ...then it will be mostly rewarding and happy.I've believed for most of my life that I could eat whatever I wanted and still look like I wanted to, so I have.I believed for the first 18 years of my life that I was the smartest person I knew. So the people around me believed this as well. It became my reality.I could go on and on. The book just put it in different words and all in one place. I am definitely not living nearly as positive as I would like and this book was a good reminder to me of what I want to be.One of my favorite Abraham Lincoln quotes has always been "People are about as happy as they make up their minds to be".Many people think this book is oversimplified nonsense. I know that. Those same people would probably minimize my list of beliefs as well.However, I'm pretty sure those are the same people that from childhood have been pessimists. Which only underscores the point yet again. Isn't it that T.V. doctor we all know that says "How's that working for you?" :)
