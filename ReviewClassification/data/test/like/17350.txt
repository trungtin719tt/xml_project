I hate this book !!I hate this book for how bitterly it made me cry :'(Dear Mom, I might not have been the perfect son to you. I might've scolded you so many times for trivial reasons. I'm sorry for all my wrongdoings to you. Even though I say to myself that I love you so much, I never really quite act by it. I ignored you, I dint give you the attention you deserved, I don't think I gave back even 5% of what you've given to me all your life. But despite my ignorance, you never felt sad but always strived to make me happy and content :'( I Just.. I really wish I could start afresh and treat you the way you are meant to be treated. I always loved you mom...I promise you that I always will. You deserve to be showered with Love,care and attention. Several years from now, I don't want to look back at the past and have the feeling of regret lingering in my heart and thinking maybe I could've spent more time with you.I love you mom. I really do :'(This book made me realise the true value and importance of a mother.It's never too late to start afresh.It's never too late to be a good son for your mother :)
