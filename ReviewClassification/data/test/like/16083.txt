Perhaps I was tired and feeling a little raw when I read this in one four-hour sitting, but that isn't the only reason I got a catch in my throat and a drop in my eye. It follows the fairy tale closely, and I still was taken in by this story. This might be a love story that male readers can stomach, even enjoy. Could the female character have been more richly developed? Sure. Could either of the fathers in the book have been more fully-formed? You bet. But I think this is a good story, well told and enjoyable all the way through.I do have a major complaint about how Flinn handles the disability of one character. I know it is YA, but her treatment of blindness just came off as condescending. I don't want a spoiler, so let me just wish for more disabled characters who are also whole people, not damaged goods awaiting repair. And let's hope for more books that flesh such characters out beyond the obvious fact of their difference. This was such a sharp thorn in an otherwise beautiful story.Update 1/8/2011 - Yep, the movie of the same name staring Vanessa Hudgens, Peter Kraus, and Mary-Kate Olsen is an interpretation of Flinn's book.
