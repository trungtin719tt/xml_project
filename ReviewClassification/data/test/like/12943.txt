This is the story of Isabel, an American who goes to England to meet new people and see more of the world. Isabel is very curious of nature, and when she gradually starts receiving different proposals from various men, she declines them all - that is because she wants to maintain her freedom which is very important to her.I really liked this story. I felt like it was very easy to read and connect with the main character as well as a lot of the other characters. The first pages of the story were deeply descriptive of the English landscape and the house where Isabel goes to at first, and I instantly felt at ease with reading about this peaceful setting.I was a bit reluctant when going into this novel because I'd heard that Henry James was rather derogative towards women. While I did see glimpses of that here and there, I also felt like Henry James really came through with the protagonist, Isabel, who is a carefree woman who lusts for adventure. She is the opposite of the women of those days and I loved her for that.All in all, I really enjoyed my reading of this story, and the ending was surprising but very suitable to the narrative.
