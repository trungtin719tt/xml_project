Though it takes a somewhat strange act to get her there, this is the story of Maria, who finds herself in Europe, in desperate need of money, so she turns to prostitution.She ends up having intense relationships with two men: One, a special client of the cafe she works out of, who has an affinity for S&amp;M and teaches her all about it. The other is man who she meets outside of work (I forget how she meets him...) and falls in love with. She doesn't really struggle with choosing between them (after all, one she sees for work, the other by choice), but it's more about her learning about the various forms of love, and particularly the role of intimacy.It's interesting to peer into two worlds of sexuality that, I'm sure, plenty people are curious about but know little of (prostitution, S&amp;M). I'm not sure if Coelho actually interviewed, knows, talked to people who were involved in lots of prostitution and/or S&amp;M, but it feels like a pretty realistic interpretation, so I give him kudos for that.I'm not sure why this is on the "Worst Books of All Time" list - WTF?Original review:Ever wonder how anyone could live through prostitution? Or get into s&amp;m? This book answers those questions. It's a fascinating character study about sex in relation to relationships, and just an overall interesting story about people and their various desires. It's also, luckily, on par with Paulo Coelho's high standards of writing, and a fun, quick read. Definitely my favorite of his thus far.
