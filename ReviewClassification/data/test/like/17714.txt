The Awakening: Fate in Motion by Suzanne Boisvert is a great book with plenty of twists and turns to keep you interested. There is a great cast of characters from Lanie to CIA Agent James Sinclair. With sinister forces at work at what seemingly is normal society, it is hard to know who to trust, and what is going on beneath the surface. Even the government may be involved. From the opening pages where Lanie asserts herself and fires her assistant to the final conclusion, this is a riveting tale, well written, with a fast paced plot, interesting characters, and enough action to keep the story moving along nicely. Supernatural powers, aliens and government conspiracies also figure prominently in this startling book. Overall, an interesting and riveting science fiction read; strongly recommend.
