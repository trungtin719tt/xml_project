This was an amazing book. I can't believe it took me so long to read it! I think Lisa Genova does a wonderful job of portraying what Alzheimer's Disease would be like and how a person with Alzheimer's is still a person with wants, likes and dislikes. I felt for Alice and all the members of her family. I was so moved by this story that I cried in parts. There is a good balance between the science and facts about the disease and an actual storyline. I have a whole new understanding of the disease. In the Q &amp; A with Lisa Genova at the end of the book, I noticed that Lisa states Oliver Sacks is her inspiration (I love his writing as well). She also states a quote by him"In examining disease, we gain wisdom about anatomy and physiology and biology. In examining the person with disease, we gain wisdom about life"and this is what she was hoping to achieve in her writing. I think she nailed it. Highly recommend this book.
