Jodi Picoultis a storyteller, a masterful one. She has everything to create the perfect story: the language, the plot, the developed characters, the relationships. A bit likeLiane Moriarty, her mysteries are unconventional, domestic. But she is more on the dramatic, tragic side, whileLiane Moriartytakes it with much more humor.In this book, Picoult touches so many important issues, the strength of love, between lovers, between parents and children. But also, the notion of truth, in court, and outside of it.Can you love somebody too much? Be too close and too attached? We all dream on true love, to get to know someone so well, that we can really understand, that we can put their needs almost (or really) before ours. How far would you go for someone that you really love?But there is such thing as too much love, almost symbiotic relationship, fusion. Where minds and personalities get so close and so connected that they have almost no distinction between them. That one feels like he can't live without the other. It is beyond healthy. It is a lot of weight to put on someone else, to love so strongly, too strongly.And how far would you go for you child? Isn't the love of your child means you would do anything for them? Picoult says on the loss of a child:"To say there had been a loss was ludicrous; one lost a shoe or a set of keys. You did not suffer the death of a child and say there was a loss. There was a catastrophe. A devastation. A hell."Picoult's descriptions of the court are outstanding. Jordan, the lawyer, is a great character and a genius in the book. I think it's the first time that I've seen a lawyer's strategy and thinking so clearly. What is important, the truth? The real truth? Or the evidence and proof? Is there such thing like a black and white truth? Or maybe, there are many different truths? And more than that, do the court, the judge, the juries, actually care and want the real truth?I can't give this book anything under 5 stars. This book is perfect, the writing, the story, the believability, the research that Picoult has put into this. She has earned every star. And she got a new fan too.
