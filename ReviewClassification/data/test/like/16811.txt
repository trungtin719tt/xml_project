This third installment in the "To Live" trilogy is very different than its predecessors. Shawn Michals/Ben Peller is on a mysterious island and gets involved with a mysterious woman, Bina, who wants him to lead a revolution. All in all, a very cool tale about finding one's self at a later stage in life. The connections to the past two books are a bit hazy, but this book is still well worth reading.
