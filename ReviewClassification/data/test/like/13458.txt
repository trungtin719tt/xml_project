Hopeful, Yet Heart-Crushing"I looked out this morning and the sun was goneTurned on some music to start my dayI lost myself in a familiar songI closed my eyes and I slipped away****I see my Marianne walkin' away...."Boston, "More Than a Feeling," 19754.2 stars [revised/shortened on 6/27]by Elizabeth Lisa,My Visualization of Marianne Engel, from novelTwo separate but related stories occur within this novel, with maybe 4/5 meta-meta-fables of love being told to the protagonist by his lover Marianne Engel (surname, German for "angel"). It works.The novel begins with our unnamed narrator looking back to himself a few years before this recounting. He grew up lonely, yet very attractive to women, as a result of which he became a self-centered drug-addicted hard-porn star, all about the conquest, pulling out his package without fear of rejection or emotional attachment. A real life of drugs, sex and "lights, camera, roll."Then he drives off the road into a ravine in trying to avoid hallucinatory arrows flying at him from the woods. His car catches fire and he suffers the worst-degree burns to most of his body and, most importantly, he losesthe only tool of his trade.He spends his time in the burn unit thinking of either his next hit of morphine or the advantages (or not) of myriad forms of suicide. Also, a devil of a snake has inhabited his spine, hissing evil thoughts.A visitor named Marianne Engel, being treated in the hospital's psych ward, begins visiting. She says she knew him in 14th Century Germany, and spins a tale of a long-ago romance. Marianne is a sculptress of stone grotesques/gargoyles.* She makes him want to live.At her insistence, he moves in with her upon leaving the hospital. Over time, she discloses their story interspersed with 3 or 4 more tales of romance, spanning centuries and continents, that give hope to our narrator as he falls desperately in love with her.She reveals that she was a nun in 14th Century Germany when she met him. [any more of their past would be a spoiler]. When she nearly died in Germany she was given another chance at life and passage into heaven if she gave away her chest full of hearts, which she does through sculpting gargoyles. She is nearly finished with her endeavor.The Gargoyleis a clever cosmic romance that heavily relies on Dante's Inferno as it explores and interprets the essence of faith in, and the ultimate sacrifice for, love. "...for all those who enter here, there is no need to abandon hope. Lessons are learned, love is found, spirits are restored, and faith is revealed..." Janet Maslin, NYTimes 2010 review.Botticelli, "Inferno, Canto XVIII"Maybe the best description of this novel:heart-crushing, yet hopeful.*A gargoyle is a grotesque with a spout for emitting water from a roof or away from the side of a building.
