There seem to be two distinct schools of Dark Tower readers. One school consider this the weakest of the seven volumes. They can't see what the point is. A huge flashback - stuff that has already happened - how does that advance the plot? I call these people the Rolands. The other school considers this to be the finest book of the series, they loved every page of the thing. They think the huge flash-back was a wonderful story in itself which develops a greater understanding of what motivates the gunslinger and where he came from. I call these people the Oys.I'm an Oy in this regard. Oys think the books are about the journey not the destination. Rolands think the destination (tower) is all-important and that any step to the side or backwards is an abomination.I believe the message of this series (slight spoiler)(view spoiler)[ is that we should be Oys rather than Rolands(hide spoiler)]This is King at his best. Wonderfully rich characters and setting. Great imagination, brilliant description, scary evil, and the tension rising relentlessly with stakes that you're made to value.It's been a while since I read this, so I won't comment in more detail.For me, not only is it the best volume but each successive volume after this is a little less good. However, I can't attribute this to the author's age/decline as I also rated The Wind Through The Keyhole very highly, and that's a nominal volume 8 which sits around 4.5 in truth and is set (IIRC) in the period a little after that covered by the flashback that occupies most of Wizard and Glass.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes.....
