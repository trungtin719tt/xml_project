Awesome read!Reads more like a novel than a history book!"To the south oozed a great lozenge of pastureland, a magnificent plain veined by watercourses and picketed tightly on all side by foothills of high mountains. Somewhere over the peaks lay the Mediterranean, cities, motorways, industry and the broadband rush of the twenty-first century. But where we were standing seemed to belong to a rawer, older world order, a place of hard-scrabble rural living" (pg 41)Butcher travels the route Gavrilo Princip took from the time he first left his village as a young boy to complete his education to the day Princip fired the shot that began the Great War, in hopes to shed some understanding on this young man, the conflict that this event began and all the ones that followed in its wake.On his travels Butcher did his best to use primary sources on his journey as well as some of the myriad of history texts about Princip and his time. In his notes and bibliography Butcher explained: "After surviving two world wars and a civil war, original documents concerning Princip were destroyed. History does not rest easy in Bosnia." (pg 305)Butcher does an excellent job of explaining this history to us in his informative text.
