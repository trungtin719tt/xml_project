this book was definitely something different, but in a good way. It's pretty much three stories about humans, and paranormal creatures breaking the rules, and falling in love, and getting into all sorts of exciting trouble. One thing that i really enjoyed about this book is that it opened me to a new style of supernatural romance. Usuall i read books that are filled with couples that show affection throughout the entire book. And that made me kinda iffy about reading this one after i read the first story since there wasn't a whole bunch of sparks going. But the story plots are awesome and it keeps you interested! And the small bits of romance just compliment it. It's hard to explain... read the book! its awesome!
