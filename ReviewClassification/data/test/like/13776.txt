This is one of my favorite books of all time, and is-for what it's worth-my favorite John Irving book in a world where everyone else picksThe World According to Garp. It's the perfect blend of sad and sweet and strange, a combination that is quite difficult to pull off. Irving himself doesn't always manage that trifecta successfully in his other works.The story is about the travails (and boy, are there travails) of the Berry family of New Hampshire, in running the titular hotel and what follows (bears, Austria and wrestling are all involved, because John Irving.) Someone quoted, "Keep passing the open windows" to me the other day, and I almost cried because I love this book so freaking much and if you've read it, you get it.It was also turned into a surprisingly faithful and underrated movie in the 1980's starring Beau Bridges, Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe.
