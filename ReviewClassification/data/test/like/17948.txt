I must admit that I was a little surprised at how much I enjoyed this book. It was like Diary of a Wimpy Kid meets science fiction.Bernard is the son of two scientists but following his mother's accidental science related death, everything seems to be going wrong. His dad is now afraid of creativity and emotion and Bernard himself is struggling at school.A chance trip to his dad's office finds Bernard sucked into a 'wormhole' and somehow ending up inside his dad's brain. It's here that he begins to understand why his dad has lost his creative spirit.It's a wonderful little book, I would think more aimed at children but definitely a fun read for adults too. It's educational in terms of science and best of all makes science both easy to understand and interesting at the same time. For someone (me) whose never really had an interest in science that's a biggie!The writing is very imaginative and the scenes and characters in the 'brainiverse' are cleverly created and easy to picture. I think this book is ideal for anyone who is interested in biology and science fiction as well. But more importantly I think everyone who has children should buy this to give them a fun way of learning about the human brain.Thank you to @brainwalkerfans on twitter for my free copy in exchange for an honest review
