This book found its way onto my shelf as a part of my daughter's summer reading list. There are big echoes of "To Kill A Mockingbird" here and - in certain ways - I found this book superior. It is certainly better written and uses an especially impressive vocabulary.A few inconsistencies kept me from loving it outright. I don't believe an eleven year old school drop-out in 1963 North Dakota would measure things in millimeters. And one cannot wax eloquent about the gibbous moon one night and then expect to have a moonless, star-studded sky the very next. Not on Planet Earth anyway.
