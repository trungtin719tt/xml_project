"I sing of warfare and a man at war.From the sea-coast of Troy in early daysHe came to Italy by destiny,To our Lavinian western shore,A fugitive, this captain, buffetedCruelly on land as on the seaBy blows from powers of the air - behind themBaleful Juno in her sleepless rage.And cruel losses were his lot in war,Till he could found a city and bring homeHis gods to Latium, land of the Latin race,The Alban lords, and the high walls of Rome.Tell me the cause now, O Muse, how galledIn her divine pride, and how sore at heartFrom her old wound, the queen of gods compelled him-A man apart, devoted to his mission-To undergo so many perilous daysAnd enter on so many trials."Years after finally readingThe IlliadandThe Odyssey(one of my high school classes went over the important bits ofThe Odyssey, but that was pretty much the beginning and end of my classical education), I got around to reading the Roman side of the story, at last.Is it blasphemy to say that I like Virgil's version more? Granted, Odysseus is probably a more compelling character, since he's at least morally complex in comparison to Aeneas's bland nobility and piety, but I kind of preferred reading the adventures of a guy who manages to be a hero without also having to be a self-centered, cheating dickbag. Even though I prefer the Greeks to the Romans overall, I'm Team Aeneas on this one, becauseman, Odysseus sucks. (I have this whole theory that everything that happens in the Odyssey is actually one huge lie concocted by Odysseus to explain why he didn't come home for ten years after the Trojan War)As in Homer's epics, some of the best parts of this book are the battle descriptions, which are exciting, detailed, and appropriately gory. There's also a lengthy description of the armor that the gods give one of the characters, and even though that sounds boring, it's actually beautiful. And I liked the supporting characters a lot more than I liked Homer's, especially Queen Dido and Camilla the warrior girl. Also Aeneas travels to the Underworld, which is always a fun time.
