31/5 - Why do they always have to change the book in order for it to become a movie?! Alexis Bledel is nothing like the way I would have imagined Lena (described as having the tanned skin of her Greek ancestry, while Bledel is quitewhite) if I had read the book first and her character's experience in the movie barely resembles that of her book's counterpart. Lena's relationship with Kostas progresses nothing like the way it is portrayed in the movie (although I have to admit that I found movie Lena more sympathetic than the original). The movie even changes how the pants are first acquired. As usual, I'm mostly baffled by the choices screen writers/directors/whoever's in charge of making these changes make.Anyway, I haven't seen/didn't love the movie enough to constantly be saying "that didn't happen in the movie" to myself as I was reading, which was good, it left me to simply enjoy the book, which I did. I liked the way the story was told with letters to each other interspersed throughout the normal writing style, although the letters could have been a bit longer so we got a little more detail in each. I will definitely be reading the next book in the series.2016 POPSUGAR Reading Challenge Category: A Book that takes Place During Summer
