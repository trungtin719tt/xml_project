This story was amazing but hard to read, mostly because I found the author tended to be a bit wordy and overly descriptive when it came to the surroundings. I would tune out and think about other things then have to re-read the page I just spaced out over.The story itself was full of action and very interesting characters. The author also included a lot of history, which I really enjoyed. I found the native cultures fascinating especially Uncas and his father who where Mohicans and how they interacted with the Huron's. The friendship between Hawkeye and the Mohicans was also quite touching. Parts of the book are quite violent, I think the author really captured the brutality of war.I had seen the movie when I was younger, and am glad I have read the book. It seems they have changed a lot from the book when making the movie, to the point where there are very few similarities left. I prefer the book much more."The Last of the Mohicans" is one of five books which is part of the "Leatherstocking Tales" Series.
