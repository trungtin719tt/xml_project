"You drive me insane, June." He murmurs against my hair. "You're the scariest, most clever, bravest person I know, and sometimes I can't catch my breath because I'm trying so hard to keep up. There will never be another like you. You realise that, don't you?" I tilt my face up to see him. His eyes reflect the faint lights from the JumboTrons, a rainbow of evening colours. "Billions of people will come and go in this world," he says softly, "but there will never be another like you."Starting 8 months after Prodigy finished, we see June working as a Princeps Elect and learning the political side to the war, and then we see Day receiving a high level military position. June and Day haven't seen each other in months, but soon they are reunited when the Elector informs them that a new plague has broken out and the Republic are being blamed. The only way the Colonies will not start another war with them, is if they come up with a cure, but the cure the Republic may have, may lie with Day's brother Eden. But will Day give up his brother so others may live?I don't even know where to start telling you how much I completely adore this series, it's definitely one of my favourites and as a writer Marie Lu continues to deliver epic work.Championwas a book for that gave me so many conflicting feelings before I even started reading. I was dreading it because I was so nervous about how it would end, and of course I was excited because I couldn't wait to see how it ends - see the conflicting feelings? Well, let me tell you that Marie Lu held my heart in her hands from the moment I started reading, and she didn't let go until the end!Marie Lu really did pull out the stops withChampion- if you like mind-blowing, non-stop action, then this is for you. She doesn't leave one dull moment, if it's not the action keeping you glued to this book then, it's your emotions pulling you in every different direction. The plot of the story increased a lot in Prodigy, and it only increases again inChampion. There's so many different factors in this book that had to all come together and I believe it was done so well. Marie Lu's imagination really has no limits - she really does have a creative mind.June and Day have really grown as characters - they're independent, selfless and strong characters - ones that have the fate of the world on their shoulder and who constantly sacrifice their own happiness for the rest of the world. June and Day's voice work so well together during this series, that reading the dual point of view really was a pleasure to read. Their love for one another is truly touching, it's one that completely consumes you and leaves you a bundle of nerves. All the odds are against them as a couple - even more so when Day's illness was introduced in Prodigy - but Marie Lu doesn't leave her readers disappointed. She doesn't make their story easy, but it's one that's worth fighting for.And ending, the ending that you all want to know about? Well, that ending left my heart completely and utterly bursting from the seams!Championtruly is a spectacular and stunning conclusion and it's one I won't be forgetting any time soon.
