OK. SO THIS BOOK WAS PRETTY GREAT.The book was very slow-moving for the first half or so, but I always found myself drawn in by the beautiful writing and the fabulous characters. This story is first and foremost about the characters, and I completely adored the friendship between the boys, and between Blue and the boys later on. Going into this, I thought it was going to be told solely from Blue's POV, and I amso gladthat it wasn't. Getting to know the boys before they got to know Blue was a real treat.
