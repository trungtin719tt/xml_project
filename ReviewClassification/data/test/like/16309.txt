There are some authors that are "go-to" for me. When I am in need of a quick read, not mindless but neither exceedingly deep, I turn to Nicholas Sparks. I know when I pick up one of his books, I will leave satisfied.This one was no exception.Miles Ryan has been struggling over the past two years to find his footing in life after his wife Missy was killed in a hit and run. Just how disconnected he has been is brought home when he finds out how badly his son Jonah is doing in school.Determined to move forward and do right by his son,Miles is drawn to Jonah's teacher, Sarah. After some fits and starts, they draw closer and fall in love. But life's path is full of twists and turns and ugliness will rear it's head. But no matter how imperfect we are, our capacity to love and forgive is great.As much a mystery as a romance,I liked that the driver in the accident had a voice. It wasn't difficult to figure out who it was, and I was left to puzzle how the romance would fare when the perpetrator was finally revealed.And as always, I enjoy reading books centered in my adopted home state of North Carolina. So, I have had my fix and am ready to move on. Thanks, Nick.
