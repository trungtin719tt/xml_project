If this book doesn't make you want to hug your mother and never let go, then I don't know what will.A story about family, about mothers, about being ungrateful, losing out on opportunities, feeling the deepest of regrets and reconciliation. The story itself is quite ordinary but for me that is what made it such a resonating read. Albom's writing is simple and sweet, and several times I put the book down for a moment to reflect. What really got me choking was the father saying "You can be a mama's boy or a daddy's boy. But you can't be both" and then towards the end of the story the mother says oh so beautifully, "a child should never have to choose."A gentle, thought-provoking read.
