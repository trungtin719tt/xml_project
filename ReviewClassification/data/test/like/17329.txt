This is a tough book to rate. Overall, I wish this had been required reading for discussion in some history class I took, but it is not a great novel. It is too long (we get it about the passport already!), and the whole extended Henry family soap opera is annoying (just let her go!), and the central plot device is preposterous--but not in a funny way: I mean if Pug Henry gets to meet every celebrity in the world, why not embrace the zaniness of this premise and have him travel around with the Marx Brothers?Having said that, many aspects are ingenious. The neighborhood horse race competition in Siena is a great metaphor for the absurd bellicosity of Europe. The occasional commentary from the Nazi general is also crucial for giving us "the other side" and painting the power of propaganda without depicting all German Christians as psychopaths. The Jews who are like frogs in boiling water and their rationalizations for that also represent a good insight. Another thing generally ignored in our Hollywood version of history is how opposed Americans were to entering WWII before Pearl Harbor and how FDR had to be very clever to deal with that in a way that prevented the risk of Hitler taking over the world. And I could go on with examples of the wisdom of Wouk.The main takeaway for me was that American democracy was much stronger back then. Wouk has many characters comment (as a criticism) on how FDR never moved more than an inch ahead of public opinion. In contrast, for the past several decades polling reveals a huge disconnect on all kinds of issues between what the public wants and what Washington does (regardless of the party in power). Pundits in this election (2016) keep asking why the two major candidates both have such low approval ratings and why one is a TV star anti-politician. Maybe it's because Americans don't feel that politicians represent the people anymore. Shouldn't they? Isn't that what the Greatest Generation fought for?
