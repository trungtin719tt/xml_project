Quick Update, 7-8-17:I didn't intend to review this again. In honesty, I'm trying to hit 150 for complete reads this year, which makes about four per week. I own a copy of this now and I knew how quickly I could read it. I'm shocked, stunned, mesmerized. I read some of his other writings and they didn't impact me the same, so I put Neruda at 20 on my list. Now I've moved him up to number 2, just under Kafka. The collection reads like a love story: a man lives a rough life, and a woman helps learn to live and love, and the painful resolution to the plot comes, but the story comes from his own life. He almost had me in tears because most of us can relate to being in love, going through difficulties and facing the inevitable end of all of us.-------------------------------------I've finally found an author who makes me feel the way Kafka makes me feel, in a different, but equally powerful way.Rather than mull over each word I get into this canoe and Neruda paddles and sweeps me along this river path of love's delight and heartbreak, and intertwined in his memories I see flashes of personal memory.What a powerful, deep, intelligent and beautiful soul!Absolutely a favorite! You can't reverse engineer this! :-)
