Blake has always been in one of my favorite English poets. As Thomas Carlyle said, "Poetry is musical thoughts" and Blake follow this tradition. His poetry has music that soothes the heart.."The Song of Innocence and Experience" is a very small book and can be read in just one sitting but its poetic fragrance will remain with you for a long time.
