Reread: January, 20161st Read : July, 2014This series continues to amaze me! I loved it the first time I read it and even gets better the second time around. There are lots of crazy and hilarious moments in this installment. The characters are all engaging and the way they interact really entertains me. I especially love Simon and Jace's banters here. And that part when they went toThe Seelie Court-- my favorite part! Although Jace kind of disappoints me with his moody attitude, I still can't resist him in this book. Theforbidden romance, the great character development, and the pacing of the bookare impressive and all worth the highlight.
