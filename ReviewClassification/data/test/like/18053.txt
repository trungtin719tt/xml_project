"Even bad books are books, and therefore holy.'But this is not a bad book. What a tightrope act it is! Sustaining the totally unreliable, possibly insane voice of Oskar through a book this long without stumbling or stretching our suspension of semi-belief is a hell of a task, and Grass totally nails it. I found this entertaining, funny, sad, weird and wholly likable.I do wish I hadn't read that part about catching eels while eating a sandwich. That shit was gross as hell.Anyone know where I can get my hands on some of this fizzpowder stuff?
