I read this book after watching the movie, and learned how vastly different it was from the cinematic version. Despite the differences and the fact I enjoyed the movie a great deal, I discovered the old adage remained true: the book was indeed better. It led me to the sequel and a couple of Groom's other books. His Southern flair is a lot of fun. I'd recommend this book to fans of the movie and most literature fans despite the differences. Both have their own charms. Very readable stuff if you ask me.
