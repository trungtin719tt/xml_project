Such a beautiful book. Though not an extremely complex plot, the story is a sweet, endearing one. It may look like a long book, but the inside is filled with so many gorgeous drawings that it can be finished in one day. And as an artist, one that loves drawing more than anything, this appealed to me an incredible amount. I fell it love with it. I loved how the pictures and prose worked together to tell the story, and how one takes off where the other stops, throughout the book. It was also inspired by one of the first movies ever made, one that I'd actually already seen, in art school. I'm excited to get into the rest of Brian Selznick's work, because he is surely incredibly talented, as an artist and a storyteller.
