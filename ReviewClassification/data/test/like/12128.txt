A wonderful, perfect reread. My heart is full.----This is one of those few times when I feel like Goodreads should have a regular star rating, and then a separate award for those Special Books. Those that take over your mind and soul. Those that somehow strike that perfect balance between cosy and haunting. The Shell Seekers is one such book.Rosamunde Pilcher is an author I've always meant to read, she's often mentioned in the same breath as comforting authors I love - Miss Read, Lucy Maud Montgomery, Georgette Heyer, but it took me this long to pick up one of her novels. I chose The Shell Seekers based solely on the title - it's a beautiful evocation of summer, and what better time than the middle of a scorching July to think about seashells?It took me a while to finish it - not that it wasn't good, it was exceptional, but I wanted to really savour it. It's so beautiful. The writing is absolutely gorgeous. Every page I read gave me that wonderful sense of communion with the characters and the places described. They're part of my family now, of my own history. At its heart, it's a story about family and what makes an individual unique - their aspirations, their memories, their possessions. I loved this so much. It's got so much truth about life it's quite staggering. I felt like I constantly needed to reread passages and make them part of those I could recite on a whim.Gorgeous, gorgeous work. If all her novels are as striking, I'm in for a delicious treat.
