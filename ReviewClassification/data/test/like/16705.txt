Loved. Loved. LOVED this book!The minute I saw this cover and read the summary, I knew Isowanted to fall in love with this book.Nightshadehas been one of my most anticipated and Andrea Cremer did not disappoint. Landing this remarkable novel on my favorite shelf and one of the best reads of 2010.It's no secret that I'm picky when it comes to this paranormal, but Cremer doesn't hold back, delivering an exceptional tale of mystery, intrigue and romance.I didn't even need to get use to the style of writing, it's smoothly paced and brilliantly told. This is definitely my kind of escape!We aren't just introduced into the world of Werewolf, but other lore is weaved into this paranormal gem. It kept me guessing and entertained from start to finish.Sometimes love triangles can be a little tiresome in books. It's expected nine out of the ten books I read. But, when done right, a love triangle can be one of the most intoxicating elements in a good read, and Nightshade provides one hell of a triangle.This one's a toughy cause I love both of these boys. Ren is strong, confident, anddripssexy. There is something incredible hawt the way he holds his power, but he doesn't ever take advantage of it. He's fair but not overly tolerant. He's also very territorial, jealous and hot-headed. I guess some readers wouldn't find that appealing, but I thought it matched the young alpha character perfectly. He has instant chemistry with Calla. A destined history. In a way Ren is like a sinfully piece of chocolate cake. Tempting, delicious and waved in front of you. Yours for the taking. Only, Calla doesn't want tohaveto submit to it...she'd rather desire it all on her own.Enter Shay Doran. Shay is sweet and kind and very different form Ren. He tumbles into this world blinded by half truths and secrets and is apart of the bigger picture that goes beyond anything they could grasp. He doesn't have the instant connection that I felt with Ren, but, it builds up. It's attraction first. Get to know each-other stage, with chemistry swiftly following. Just the way I like my love triangles mixed.Calla is a great character with a great heart. She sacrificed so much to do what was right and I really feel for her situation. She may be a warrior but she's also a teenage girl who is struggling between her loyalty, her duty, and her heart.The tug-of-war between the boys was amusing and totally swoon-worthy. Not to say that it wasn't a bit frustrating with all the back and forth action going on. It made it just has hard for the reader to choice a favorite as it was for the character. But sadly, I already have my my favorite:( These triangles are almost always predictable so I think I know where this will end once the series is said and done, but, a girl can always have hope.The rest of the packmates are awesome and I absolutely adore Ansel, he is everything adorable and precious I love in a character.I can't say that I was very happy about the whole Efron/Sabine, Logan/Mason bit. It bothered me. But, it's meant too, so it was easy to shrug off. Every character is graced with there one personality and attitude and I really loved that.The plot line itself is amazing. It's more then a battle for Calla's heart. There is so much history between the Keepers and Searchers with the Guardians stuck in the middle. It's laced with prophecies, fate, war, betrayal and magic. It ends with a hefty cliffhanger giving the readers the pause-effect and making the sequel that much more demanding.Basically, I loved this book to pieces. It has some really touching moments, it's sexy and deliciously enticing. It's also unique, captivating and fun as hell!Can't wait to get my hands onWolfbaneand back into this incredible world!A Sensational debut!!
