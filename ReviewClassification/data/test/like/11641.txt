I think this book is one of those rare cases in which not even the author knew what he actually wants to say, and was honest about it. This is a beautiful thing; most writers tend to nurture a god-complex and an unhealthy certainty of thought. In other words, they are too damn sure of themselves. Fowles, on the other hand, makes a great show of our incredible ignorance for the many layers of the world. Of course, this is just what I saw at this tender age of mine. Another mind will see it differently. But isn't it what postmodernism is all about? Freedom of interpretation.Before I started The Magus, I had no idea what to expect from it. I gave myself the privilege of uncertainty, which I reserve only for a few elected books which promise to be really, really good. I wasn't disappointed. It was good indeed, like a fancy treat for the mind.But.Let's say you are a very cultured person. You know mythology, history, religion, even science - all the great ways of the world. You manage to get people to be hypnotised with you and they obviously think you're very smart. And one day -bam! - you start talking to them about tarot cards, parallel dimensions and moonlit orgies. That was what Fowles got all wrong. Being fascinated with mythology, he artificially transformed the real world into myth and esoterism, thus making the myth itself ridiculous. If all the gods of Greece would show up in the street, wouldn't you laugh and clap at them? The whole book is a painfully constructed myth, and Conchis-Fowles is a misfit, not a god. He creates out of inadaptability, not out of genius. Of course, his strategical genius and people skills are of great help in his plan. But what is his plan? Does he want to teach Nicholas the power of reason? But by his own actions he denies reason. Does he want to perform an experiment? But isn't experiment a tool of science, not of mysticism? He wants to be taken seriously, but I cannot do that, in the same way I wouldn't take Zeus in the middle of Central Square seriously.Now, about the good part. Because it has indeed some really great ideas that made me think. First, on the nature of freedom. There's a beautiful speech about it at some point in the book, and especially about freedom of will. I think it could all be summarized in the words attributed to the Christian apostle Paul: " 'All things are lawful for me,' but I will not be enslaved by anything." Basically, freedom does not obey good or evil. It transcends them. But freedom also means being free to chose not to wield it. It lies not in doing anything you want, but in choosing not to do everything you could.Second, about the absurdity of war. Fowles does the simple obvious thing of putting human life above war, a fact often overlooked by all pseudopatriotic and egotistical self-accomplishing views claiming that war is a noble thing. Life is larger than war, freedom is larger than life. The only thing larger than freedom is freedom itself.There are many many more things that I could write about this book. For example, how the truth is never the truth but a further road into confusion. How trying to outplay the master puppeteer leads to endless frustrating failures. How we can never be objective when it comes to ourselves. But let those be for another time.
