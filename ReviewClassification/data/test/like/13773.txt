The Hotel New Hampshireis book five in my John Irving Challenge, wherein I am attempting to read all of John Irving's novels in under a year's time. On with the review.Incest is the best!Oof. Just typing that made my stomach flip. Incest is one of my only triggers. That and the death of very young children, kids between zero and five, their deaths just fucking wreck me, man. Incest just makes me feel ill. It's a core reaction. Not sure where the aversion stems from, if it's natural or learned, but yeah, yuck.John Irving's fifth novel was a challenging read for me. It made me reevaluate how I looked at consensual incest; family members who are a) over the age of consent and b) horny for each other. My final opinion on it hasn't changed, but it did make me consider what my stance on the subject should be, on a moral level. And my conclusion is, I will treat it like I treat the topic of abortion. More on that in a minute.The Hotel New Hampshireis a fantastically-written book. The level of emotional detail is stunning. It's heartbreaking and thought-provoking and all those other back-cover blurbs. But the thing that impacted me the most was not to my liking. That is the aforementioned incest. And, unfortunately, that is what I feel will stay with me the longest. But why is that? Let's talk about it.Why should I care what grown people do in the privacy of their own bedrooms? I don't agree with abortion, but I understand that's not my fucking place to speak. At the end of the day, how I feel about abortiondoes not matter.For one, I'm a man. I'll never have to put my body through a pregnancy. Secondly, I feel that abortion is a far better option than a child being raised by people who do not want it, or being raised in the system, or being raised in any other toxic environment. Thirdly, it's none of my business what other people do with their own bodies. (Is that the same thing as the first reason? Probably, but I feel it bears repeating.) So, other than it being illegal, is incest wrong if it is between two consenting adults who *shivers* want each other sexually? Fuck if I know. This discussion is too multi-layered for my pea-brain to tackle, so I'm taking the abortion-stance route. As long as it doesn't affect me, do whatever the fuck you want. Prolly best if you keep that shit on the DL though, just sayin.With or without the incest, this is a great read. I never once wanted to put it down. Due to that alone, I feel that I cannot award it any less than four stars. The only reason I'm giving it four instead of five is because I was disturbed, to my core, by John and Franny's relationship. I enjoyed nothing about it. Irving went too far, I feel, but all good literature does. I simply can't say it was a perfect read when I was dreading whole sections.Even as I type this I'm flip-flopping. But I think I'll stick with four stars. I honestly want to give it five, but I know the family-play will put some people off as much as it put me off.Yeah, okay, whatever, four stars.Maybe.Okay, for today it's four stars. Tomorrow? Who the fuck knows.In summation: A four-star read in a five-star package.The Hotel New Hampshireis wonderfully written and affecting. If you can handle sex between siblings, give it a try. It's not the entire plot, but it does take up much of the last fourth of the book.Final Judgment: I can honestly say this is the best book with an incestuous relationship that I've read.
