Time travel gets me almost everytime!This novel was exciting and unique, I could hardly put it down. Cool quantum technology that I barely understood aside, I felt like I was transported to the 100 Years War along with the team that sets out to find the Professor. And that's what makes a good novel into a great novel for me, and Timeline delivered.One of Crichton's best.And I got a crush on Marek so that helps in keeping it on my favorite book list. I think I'll read in again soon.
