Literally could not put this book down. It was my first experience with Anne Rice and I honestly wanted to jump on the bandwagon and read all of her works after this.It's really wonderful because, as it was my first experience with Rice, I was still able to follow it without reading the books that come before it in the series. It stands as its own individual piece and I really appreciated not having to hunt the others down before starting on this one (my mom bought it for me at a thrift store).For an Anne Rice novel, I was expecting vomit-inducing gore, just because that's how I've heard her stereotyped. I watched the Interview With A Vampire movie before reading this, so I knew a bit of what to expect...I was just led to believe that it was far more graphic than the movie. It really wasn't, I was able to handle every thing that happened and only felt sick when I was feeling what the characters were going through. I connected with them that well, it was a very well written story and the characters were believable for the monsters that they were. Not too monstrous, not too human. Except the queen. She was awful, like a villain should be. And Lestat is a butt-head. But I forgive him.
