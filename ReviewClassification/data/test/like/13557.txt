"Tender is the Night" is the story of Dick Diver, a charming young psychiatrist, whose life spiraled downhill due to alcoholism and the pressures of marriage to mentally ill Nicole Warren. He is trying to be a psychiatrist, a husband, and even a father figure to Nicole. The young Dick Diver is based a bit on the author's friend, Gerald Murphy. As the novel progresses, the characters of Dick and Nicole increasingly resemble Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald.I had mixed feelings reading the story. On one hand, Fitzgerald has written many beautiful and insightful scenes in the book. He's included interesting themes of mental health treatment, sexual abuse, a difficult marriage, infidelity, and alcoholism. The novel is set in wonderful settings--the French Riviera, Paris, and Italy. The characters are partly based on the rich, famous, and artistic people the Fitzgeralds socialized with in the 1920s. But the story contains many incidents that never go anywhere. The first part of the book, involving the young starlet Rosemary meeting the married Dick Diver, is overly long and slow.I've done some reading in the past about Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald so it was heartbreaking reading about the decline of Dick Diver. "Tender in the Night" is a flawed book, but a beautifully tragic story. 3.5 to 4 stars.
