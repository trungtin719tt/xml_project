I first heard about The Story of Ferdinand by Munro Leaf through the film The Blind Side (2009). Munro Leaf was an American author who wrote this book in 1936. It is the story of a bull named Ferdinand and his happy existence sitting quietly and smelling the flowers.The book is illustrated in black and white by Robert Lawson and there is a picture, when Ferdinand is being taken to star in a bull fight in Madrid, of what looks like the bridge in Ronda. This book is charming and informative as there are new words introduced such as Banderilleros, Picadores and the Matador.We could use this book with KS1 children and explore what these words mean in Spanish. Also I think it is a great message about being kind, nice and different from others.
