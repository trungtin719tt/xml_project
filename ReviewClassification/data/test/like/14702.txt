3.5 starsWere you expecting something else for this series? If I themed books 1 &amp; 2 like this, I might as well continue the trend. I'll start off in the right order this time with Good Cop.Good Cop!1.Daemon.Enough said.2.Action Sequences.Some of what I'd asked for in the first couple of books was brought to the table withOpal. We're dealing with aliens and the baddies out to get them. As much as I love the sexual tension in these books, if that's all there is, then the entire point of aliens and powers and all of that fun stuff is wasted. I might as well go read another generic-plot contemporary romance instead. Thankfully, the balance was working in this book!3.There were many great quote-worthy passages.I marked several funny quotes, a few sweet lines, and a couple of downright sexy moments. Unfortunately, this review will be long enough without me adding in my highlights, so I'll be leaving them out this time.Mini Spoiler - I'd advise clicking on it anyway, otherwise this picture will make no sense.(view spoiler)[3.It's McNugget and Carnation time.For those of you who have read myreview for Onyxyou'll get what this means. We all knew it was coming eventually, but I'm happy that it happened sooner rather than later.You should be thankful that something finally happened because I really didn't want to have to go into McNugget rage mode.(hide spoiler)]Note : This is not actually a picture of me.Bad Cop!1.I had the same issue with this book that I had with book 2.I'm not sure what's slipped off with the last couple of books, but both of them started out sort of blah. The first several chapters had me thinking that not even Daemon was capable of fixing my ongoing reading slump because the plot needed a serious boost. Even so, everything worked out fine when the story hit a good stride, and all's well that ends well.2.Katy's still needing hair ties.Hell, I think Daemon and Dawson might need some too. They all seem to have issues with hair falling in the face. It just only appears that Katy's the only one who gets hers tucked back by not only herself, but also by the males in her general vicinity.3.The YA book reference train continues.This doesn't personalize a book for me; it only dates it.4.Preach much?The comment on how book piraters suck made me want to look for a soapbox.But hey, my complaints are becoming smaller and smaller!Other than having a serious reading slump when I picked upOpalwhich didn't help with my thoughts about the slow start, I had a blast while reading from about 30% on. Overall, the series is coming along quite nicely. It's not my favorite YAPNR (not even going to pretend this is sci-fi, even if we do have aliens running around) series, but it's still one of the few series in the genre that I really do enjoy for the most part. I'll be looking forward to the next in the series because who knows...maybe the bad cop section will end up almost nonexistent with the positive direction we're headed in.
