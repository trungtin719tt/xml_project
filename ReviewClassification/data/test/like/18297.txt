I love these books! My Dad bought me the first book, A Wrinkle in Time, when I was a young girl. I quickly devoured it and the subsequent follow-ups. I have reread them as an adult as well and enjoyed them just as much as when I was a child. The characters in the books make you feel like you don't have to be perfect or fit the same mold as everyone else to make a difference. It makes you realize that everyone has strengths, weaknesses, and insecurities, and that we should not be so quick to judge. L'Engle's books are unique , but very enjoyable for both children and adults.
