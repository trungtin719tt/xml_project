Boisvert narrates this story of good versus evil with plenty of twists and turns that kept me hooked without a break. I like the way the author uses a great cast of characters with each having a background story that links up to give a powerful connection. The way Boisvert sets up the suspense such that it is hard to know whom to trust will keep you glued to the story to the end.The riveting tale is well written, with interesting characters, fast-paced plot and plenty of action to maintain the nice-moving story. The mix of government conspiracies, aliens and supernatural powers creates a compelling science fiction that is hard to put down once you get started.It is nice to see a great combination of fantasy and science fiction to create a sense of darkness brewing under the surface ready to explode on your face.
