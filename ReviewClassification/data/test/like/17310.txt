Winds of War isn't my favorite book of the (almost dwindled) year. Nor does it break into my all time top 10 books. What it is, is simply a balancing act. In its bare bones, this book is a melodrama. But this undesirable component is supported by a blissfully solemn narrative. The main cast is the Henry family. The book's entire length is about how different these people are from each other, and how much do they cross paths despite their nomadic existence.All of which has World War 2 as a canvass. The various big shots of history are not written into the book with equal effect. Hitler, unsurprisingly, is given the most treatment. In my mind I cast a Richard Dawkins lookalike as Roosevelt. Worked for me. Churchill is the one disappointment. Stalin is just average. The horrors of war are merely hinted at. Bloodshed doesn't happen by the buckets here. What we see is a world unprepared by modern warfare and global politics. The proven wisdom caught with its pants down.Since the War is not shown through the eyes of the soon to be dead, its harshness is lessened. The best thing about this book is the twists. These are plausible and satisfactory. I loved the Natalie Jastrow, Leslie Slote, and Pamela Tudsbury characters. I hated the Uncle Jastrow and had contempt for the disillusioned and delusional main character, Victor Henry. So I had a blast living with this book for a couple of weeks. It's much better than the pathetic Century trilogy by Ken Follett. I want to know what happens next. Nothing is guaranteed, but the story is not finished. Which means that the sequel theoretically can be as good as this book.
