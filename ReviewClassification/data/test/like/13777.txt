Awesome book. I had never read Irving before, and I have no idea why not. He's like that Deli that you always drive by but never go into, then one day decide "what the hell" and it turns out to have the best pastrami sandwich you've ever had in your life.Anyway, the story revolves around an unusual family growing up and learning about sex, sports, love, death, failure, success, etc etc. It's quirky and funny and strange - Irving has a knack for finding little bits of truth in truly bizarre situations.Oh, and the main love story is between a brother and sister, so...yeah.My only complaint is that the ending is a little too neat, everything fits together a little too well. The rest of the book is messy and bursting at the seams, so it doesn't quite fit. Other than that though, 4 stars.
