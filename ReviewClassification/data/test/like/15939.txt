A city of glass, 1,000 years in the future, domed, with a green wall, to keep out all the undesirable, primitive life forms. Animal, human, vegetable or insect...A clean and sparkling place, for its millions of citizens, everything and everyone, has a schedule, the perfect "One State". No privacy, people have numbers for names, they dress (light blue uniforms) , and eat the same food, live in small, sparse apartments, which are transparent. No drinking or smoking, even sex regulated by, yes, an appointment. Regular daily walks, pep talks at auditoriums, to keep all, motivated. Thousands sing and listen to the sacred words, they have heard, countless times before. Guardians to help the "Benefactor's" rules, be followed, timetables are enforced! Any deviations, are rigorously crushed. D-503, is the chief, in charge, of building the spaceship, Integral, now the perfect society, can conquer space, soon bringing happiness and order, to a chaotic universe.

He is taken by her, amazingly, outside the walls, he feels naked, uncomfortable . Seeing crawling things, always moving about, in the frightening, and unknown green environment, is the vegetation, very unhealthy ? Yellow fruit, which D-503, recognized, from ancient books, in old museums. The hot sun shining down, nothing to regulate it here, humans too, dressed unalike ... Weird, they don't look any different, from us. The wise man, is drawn deeper into a plot, he just can't say no, to the beautiful, 1-330. Causing much turbulence between he and dear, jealous, 0-90, but he is being watched, closely, by the Guardians. Does he risk torture and death, for the woman he loves, who may just be using D-503, for her own, personal ambitions? Still the builder, is a romantic, at heart, in a civilization, that doesn't believe or tolerate, such nonsense.
