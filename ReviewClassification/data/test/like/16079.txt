This is a retelling of the Beauty &amp; the Beast from the Beast's point of view.It's set in modern times in NYC.The beast is Kyle Kingsbury, a spoiled, selfish, narcissistic, extremely good-looking teen who gets away with much with only his winning smile.After a cruel joke on a homely, overweight classmate, a witch turns him into the beast.He has 2 years to find someone who will truly love him as he is, and whom he must also love.When she kisses him, the curse is lifted.But if he fails to find her, he will remain a beast forever.Kyle's transition from selfish bad-boy to considerate human is very believable, interesting &amp; enjoyable to watch.I'm not a huge fan of fairytale re-tellings, and I'll admit, I was a little disappointed when I realized this was a beauty &amp; the beast story.But I still enjoyed it.Even though I'm years behind, I'm looking forward to reading the other books in this series.
