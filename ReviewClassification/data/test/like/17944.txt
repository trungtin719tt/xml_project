4 starsEven though this book is listed under the genres 'Middle Grade' and 'Teens &amp; YA' on NetGalley, I honestly thought it was a Middle Grade book while I was reading it. So imagine my surprise when I realised that it was meant for teens as well. Not because it was childish, but because it just isn't like your typical YA novel.Brainwalkerwas a short and easy read. The story is easy to understand and follow. (A boy gets sucked into a wormhole that leads to his father's brain. In there, he finds theBrainiverseand realises that his father's life is in danger and rushes against time to save him.) It doesn't complicate itself by being overly deep or descriptive like many YA novels are apparently attempting to do nowadays. InsteadBrainwalkerputs its focus on other aspects, especially the characters.The world building was solid. It is largely based off the theory of the right and left brain. The theory has been debunked as a myth, but it's still an interesting theory nonetheless. So enter theBrainiverse, where the right hemisphere is calledIntuitand the left hemisphere is calledReezon. Simple, brilliant names. I honestly expected there to be lots of scientific jargon in this book but I was proven wrong. The brief mention of the corpus callosum is just about as scientific as it gets. And even that gets renamed toThe Great Arc.I do have some parts I'm not satisfied with, especially the ending.(view spoiler)[I enjoyed reading about Bernard reconcile with his father. I liked his temporary amnesia.(hide spoiler)]But I just felt that it ended pretty abruptly.Instagram//Blog//Tumblr//Twitter
