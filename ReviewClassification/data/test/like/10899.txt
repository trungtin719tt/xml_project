I have wanted to reread The Talisman for many years, and I did it! I was worried that it wouldn't be as good as it was the first time around. It has been at least twenty five years since I first read it.I am happy to say the intervening years did nothing to diminish this epic story's capacity to engage and absorb me. A boy hits the road, on a mission to cross the country and find the mystical object which has the power to heal his cancer-stricken mother.More coming of age tale than anything else, this book is epic fanasy with a healthy dose of gory horror and suspense.It is a bit overlong, but the writing is so good, it doesn't matter.
