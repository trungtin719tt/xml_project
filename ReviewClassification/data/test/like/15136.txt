The Opening Line:Camus in an interview given in 1945: "No, I am not an existentialist. Sartre and I are always surprised to see our names linked..."My Reactions after/while reading the novel:1. Camus must be an existentialist and that too an advocate of negative existentialism, that which holds there is no meaning for human existence. In the search for meaning, man is distressed and he dies without any comfort of having received a proper answer. In fact, death liberates him from his struggles. Death is the saviour. (I warn you that these philosophical understandings are purely subjective and marred by my personal prejudices associated with them).2. Camus must have been the fan of Jean Paul Sartre, the advocate of negative existentialism. The thoughts expressed in this novel regarding the themes - freedom and judgment - convinced me of it. Sartre held that man is condemned to be free. Out of his freedom when he acts he is held responsible. Thus, it is a joke to say that man is free. For freedom binds man. Camus echoes these thoughts in this novel and in the other novel (The Stranger) that I had read. In this novel, Camus advises that it is better to be a slave of a master than a free man. (Seems to be speaking for Nietzsche's Master and Slave morality!) For as a slave, it is easy to obey and be without any repentance for the actions. Otherwise, the free man acts and becomes the object of judgment for others. Everyone judges the other. No one is exempted. Your neighbour, the one who is sitting close to you, is the first one.What is the duty of a man then? To avoid the judgments. But that is hardly possible. So what is the other option? If you are equal among the equals it is better to be more equal than the other. (Orwell must be smiling!) The way proposed is to confess/accept your failings and misdeeds. Camus also says that no one is innocent, not even Jesus Christ! So, it is better to confess first and then you elevate your position to your advantage. Now, you can judge for you have earned it. He writes: "I grow taller, I breathe freely, I am on the mountain, the plain stretches before my eyes. How intoxicating to feel like God the Father and to hand out definitive testimonials of bad character and habits."Everything else (love, women, work, family, religion) might give temporary relief to escape from the boredom of life. But they are not permanent. Life is basically to dodge the judgment or to be in a better position to judge others. Man, to be completely liberated, has to be judge-penitent. And that is the way the main character defines himself from the beginning. By the way the main character's name is Jean Baptiste Clamence. I found that name rhyming easily with Jean Paul Sartre. Moreover, the name is synonym of the combined professions of Judge (john, the Baptist) and Penitent (Clemency). Camus was very intelligent to put together so many things in so nut shell a form (107 pages).By the way, I have just pointed out few of my impressions relating to some philosophers and philosophical schools. There are other interesting and provocative thoughts as well relating to family, love, women, religion, God, ego, etc. Go for it.....
