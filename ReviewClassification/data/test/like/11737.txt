I have vacillated between a four and five star rating on this. I LOVE the words. Each page was a delicious treat that kept me on the edge of my seat...what metaphor or simile or pun would Robbins pull out of the treasure chest that is his brain? I fell in LOVE with the language. I know it sounds weird, but the way he wrote about the beet and all vegetables on the very first page sold me. I knew this book would be amazing.The only thing that keeps me from giving it 100% are the main story lines. They didn't flow as I hoped they would, or intertwine as simply as they were supposed to for me. I lost a little interest in Priscilla, I wasn't all that fascinated with Pan....the French Marcel didn't hold any special place in my heart....thus, the four star rating.But READ it! Four stars from me is a GOOD, GOOD thing!You'll never look at a beet the same way again!HERE ARE SOME OF THE QUOTES I LIKED:The Middle Ages hangs over history's belt like a beer belly. It is too late now for aerobic dancing or cottage cheese lunches to reduce the Middle Ages. History will have to wear size 48 shorts forever.In the quiet ache of the evening, Alobar listened to his calluses grow.I journey to the east, where I have been told, there are men who have taught death some manners.Louisiana in September was like an obscene phone call from nature. The air - moist, sultry, secretive, and far from fresh - felt as if it were being exhaled into one's face. Sometimes it even sounded like heavy breathing.To achieve the impossible, it is precisely the unthinkable that must be thought.
