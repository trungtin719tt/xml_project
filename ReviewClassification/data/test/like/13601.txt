Finally, science fiction with worthwhile and nuanced commentary that isn't overly Hobbesian! And it's wonderfully comedic as well; it's comprised of black humor that doesn't depress me after I have a long reflection of the author's messages! It pokes fun at the world, and keeps me laughing! Thank you, Douglas Adams, for not taking this world too seriously.I felt the first book and the first part of this book were alright, in the sense that its jokes made me chuckle and I thought now and then, "Well, that's clever." However, what this part of the series led to, to the end of this second book, is just fantastic. I can't discuss it without giving away spoilers, but I lovingly appreciate the intricacy of the plot Adams wrote and how all of the seemingly surreal or absurdist humor ultimately convened into one large, amazing idea or statement about human behavior.This is now a favorite of mine!
