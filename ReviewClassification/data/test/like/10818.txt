(I warn you, this review contains spoilers, though it doesn't really ruin the storyline, I don't think!)The introduction to this book is, as in all the other books with Lestat as a narrator, fantastic. I love the way he always introduces himself, the vain bastard that he is. And of course (because I'm a sad little girl with no life who develops attractions for literary creatures) I hang on each line, wondering "Oh, what did you do THIS TIME?!"To be very honest, when I started the book, I wasn't entirely enamored with it. The multiple view-point aspect of if confused me just a little (perhaps because for months and months before I had been reading countless first-person narratives). Although, from the moment that Jesse walks into the story I was drawn in, hook, line and sinker. Maybe it was the idea of this mysterious Maharet lady, or perhaps it was the idea of a supernatural investigations group (any "X-Files" fan would fall for the idea of the Talamasca, surely)that fetched me and I was utterly involved with the story. I was INSIDE the novel. You couldn't get me out. I read it from breakfast until dinner time one Saturday when I had leave to get away with it.Jesse seems to be key in a lot of my favourite scenes in this book - we get this fantastic piece of insight into the mind of Claudia when Jesse finds her diary (the diary calls out for another novel entirely - only Claudia would have told the truth about what actually happened between those two bitter men who like to spite each other in their respective autobiographies). Claudia loved Lestat as much as she hated him, and I think that her love for him was a little bit more desire-based than her love for Louis which was need-based... Anyway, the fact that she wanted him in a very non-childish way is perhaps a good reason for her to hate him...Jesse is also the key character in my very favourite scene in all of fiction - (save perhaps the "Midsummer's Day" passages of "I Capture The Castle" by Dodie Smith) - the scene where the Brat Prince is onstage, a 1980's rock star to put Jon Bon Jovi and Axl Rose to shame, and she jumps up to him. I swear, no character in any novel has ever come across sexier than the vampire rockstar. It's a superficial enough reason to love that passage of a book, but what can I say, I love fiction, I love music! (The song I have soundtracked for that scene is "March Of The Black Queen" by the band Queen - it sounds exactly like the band The Vampire Lestat sounds in my head... Just by-the-by).Anyway, after the concert scene the story takes on a whirlwind life of its own.Several plotlines string together seamlessly - which makes this novel perhaps one of the deftest pieces of complex storytelling that I have ever read. Suddenly Armand, Daniel, Marius, Louis, Gabrielle, Mael, Khaymen, Eric, Santino, Maharet and Jesse are all in a room together. The sheer idea of it amused me - it was like the Teddy Bears' Picnic for vampires. Meanwhile Lestat is whisked away on a killing spree with an ancient and evil vampire!In alternate pieces we are given what basically translates as to being the Book Of Genesis for vampires and the tale of a stupid blond idiot who runs away with a strange woman and finds that she's not quite what she seems.We also get to meet my favourite female character in all of the Chronicles: Maharet. A vampire who was made after she had a child. A vampire who has spent her eternity watching over each of her direct descendants. I'm from rural Ireland and I always make the analogy that "If she wasn't a blood-drinker, Maharet would invite you in for a cup of tea!" She's truly a wonderful character - perhaps the only character that Rice has ever created that was truly kind and without a malevolent streak.The history of the vampires, set in ancient Egypt is truly compelling - but then again, ever since childhood, I've loved the idea of Ancient Egypt. Akasha is an interesting character, though she bears some similarities with our fateful storyteller: Lestat. She is essentially his personality except of a different time: bratty, with an idea that she is entitled to all that she desires. Although, he is not a megalomaniac.Eventually the two storylines collide containing one of my favourite quotes of late (said by Lestat as he looks upon all the vampires who are gathered together): "Finally, those you love are simply... Those you love." It kind of describes my own mismatched family.And the ending is hilarious. Marius makes up the "new rules" and promptly Lestat decides to go out and break them, tossing his hair and asking Louis to tell him that he's bad, just because he loves to hear it. Classic!
