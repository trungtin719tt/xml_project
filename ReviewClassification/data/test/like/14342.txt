I became quite enchanted with this tale and really loved the interwoven bewitching dark fairy tales that added more dimensions to this novel. It was a mystery that had me second guessing myself several times. Every time I had it all figured out a new chink was added to the chain of clues. I think the style of writing was superbly done, not often can I say that. I loved the way each chapter transported me to another time and a different POV spanning the generation of women in the family. I did find new evil villains I wanted to see crushed and burned. Such evil greedy self righteous ploys they created for each had their own agendas and were so stone cold hearted.I honestly would have liked to have read more about Cassandra's new beginnings and how her life changed after revealing so many lost secrets "just a touch more closer". That is why I would hesitate on giving it 5 stars. I was a little put out that I didn't get more of her story. I do think the ending encounter was endearing and made me feel that peace was restored for Nell and lovely Eliza, the most unselfish characters I have ever read about. Made me really wish to have or create an unspoiled secret garden with roots to my own past. Wouldn't we all want a place of solitude to get away from it all and sit with a book while ancestral phantoms sprinkle their fairy dust-like magic into our lives to ease the daily stresses and reassure us we are loved? Really made take a look into the past generations of women in my family and wonder at all the impressions they have naturally left upon me to share with my children and their children's children. Time to journal more that's for sure, cause I have a broken green thumb!
