I finished this book with two clear ambitions in mind:1. I wanted to jump on the next flight to Dublin.2. I wanted to sandwich myself between Jericho Barrons &amp; V'lane (preferably naked).Let's just say that this is one of the most addictive stories I've read in a long time; even as I write this review, the second in the series is on it's way to me courtesy of Amazon.It just has... everything. A crime mystery, a fantasy world steeped in history and folklore, and the kind of men that you would hate in real life but are the most erotic thing imaginable in literature. I can't believe I've waited so long before starting this series!
