Another book that I really enjoyed because of the characters - the main character, Penelope, in particular. The story is another of those sprawling family stories (in both time and space and characters), which in general, I enjoy very much, as long as they are skillfully told and executed.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
