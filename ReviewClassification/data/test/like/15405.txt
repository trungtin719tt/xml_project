The Holy Bibleis a letter from God about His family. He tells about His sons and daughters such as Moses, Abraham, and Deborah, and most of all, tells us how we can be saved through His Son Jesus Christ. The last section of this book, called the New Testament, explains how Jesus, who was God's Son, came to earth in the form of a man, and gave His life so that we could go to heaven to be with Him. Three of my favourite quotes from this book are "God so loved the world that He gave His one and only Son, so that whoever believes in Him will not die but have eternal life", "If you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved", and "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall trouble or hardship or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword? No, in all these things we are more than conquerors through Him who loved us. For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord."I really enjoyed this book because it completely changed the way I thought about the world. It taught me that getting to heaven is not achieved by good works, but by accepting the grace of God who loves me more than I could ever imagine. I strongly encourage you to read this book - it will change your life.
