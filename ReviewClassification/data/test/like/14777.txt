Lmao what did I just read. This was a complete fiasco. This was like if you smushed every Bret Easton Ellis book into one and then added a sprinkle of Stephen King weirdness and timesed the metafiction by 100. Bret was the main character but he was also the writer but he was also interacting with characters from his books who were both real and fictional on very different levels. And he was also being haunted by a demon. And there was a rabid dog. And a lot of themes about being a parent. Oh and Jay McInerney was in it too.Basically this book started out really good and then it was a mess but it was a good mess.
