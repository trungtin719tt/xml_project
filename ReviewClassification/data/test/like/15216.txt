"None of these creatures are good. Not the way we think of good. None are safe. Much of morality is peculiar to mortality. The best creatures here are merely not evil."This was such a wonderful mythical magical read. Kendra and Seth are ( siblings ) the leads in this fantasy filled with fairies, naiads, golems and witches. This is my first Brandon Mull book and I can boldly say, I was left feeling more than satisfied with frequent nostalgic feelings of my younger days lol. Even though this is a children's book the story was gripping and the world that the author created most fascinating.I will definitely be continuing this series.
