This is where it all started - the brilliance of Arthur Conan Doyle and the wonderful creation that is Sherlock Holmes along with Dr Watson and cast of supporting characters are all here and in fantastic form.Whilst less well known than other Holmes novel (i.e. 'Hound of the Baskervilles') I do think that 'A Study in Scarlett' is one of the strongest, is not the strongest in the series.It is difficult to think of many literary characters who have had anything like the huge impact that Sherlock Holmes has had - not just in literary terms, but culturally as well. The legend that is Sherlock Holmes goes way beyond the world of the written word - and for good reason too; as a character, Holmes is a wonderfully original, eccentric, sociopathic, misanthropic, fascinating, astonishingly brilliant and almost unparalleled creation. The wonderful character that is Sherlock Holmes - both hero and anti-hero, coupled with the conversely grounded Dr Watson and the fascinating stories / cases / mysteries that Conan Doyle weaves for the reader compound to produce the excellent Sherlock Holmes novels - of which 'A Study in Scarlett' is definitely one of the best.It is also difficult to think of any literary characters other than Sherlock Holmes, who have created such an aura of mystery surrounding them, a mythology, an industry almost - very much blurring the boundaries between fact and fiction - creating (in some quarters) a belief that Holmes was indeed a real person, who lived at 221b Baker Street, London - it's there, you can visit 'the home of Sherlock Holmes' - thus adding to and fueling the whole mythology.Whilst not for everyone - these are brilliant and fascinating stories, lots of fun and come highly recommended.'The game is afoot'(Originally Shakespeare - appropriated unforgettably by Arthur Conan Doyle for Sherlock Holmes).
