I'm not really a huge fan of Westerns. Only rarely do I settle into this genre and find myself enjoying it. I'm also a bit hesitant when it comes to classics, perhaps from all the years in school of being beaten over the head with them and then forced to analyze the shit out of them.However,I was pleasantly surprisedbyNo Country For Old Men.This book is a fast-paced, bloody chase. It's chalk full of morally questionable characters, with good and bad intentions. The setting is gritty and realistic.I will say that the writing style is rather... unadorned.But honestly it works well here and compliments the storytelling.It's a little strange to get used to if you're unfamiliar with this style of writing, but it wasn't much of a distraction.Myfavoriteaspect of this story was the banter between characters.Everyone in this book is either pure as a cotton or a smartass bastard.Some very clever moments had me laughing out loud!The story can come off as a littlepreachyat times, but it depends on which character you put stock into. I got the impression that is a textual criticism of society's moral decay, but simultaneously a commentary about how previous generations view the unique problems and challenges of future generations.But hey! That's the wonderful thing about reviewing a classic outside of a classroom setting. No one's grading my opinion!I'll definitely be picking up the movie adaption of this book soon!
