I have no idea this book could be so awesome! I have to admit.... the cover scared me away (not a huge "fantasy" fan, generally....) but this was honestly one of the best books I've ever read. Fantastic writing for older elementary - but held me glued to it as an adult. Off to the library to get the rest in the series....
