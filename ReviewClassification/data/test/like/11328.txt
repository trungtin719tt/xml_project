Breathless.That's what I'm currently feeling right now. I can't barely breathe (literally) just how amazing and major cliffhanger-y this book ended. Just give me a minute to catch a breath. **takes a deep breath** **starts to relax** Ok, so may the review starts!What I Love:-The plot of the story.The idea of Kalona, a sexy fallen angel who is currently the antagonist, once being Nyx's Warrior and Zoey being the reincarnation of A-aya (I hope I spelled it right) totally spiced up the story!-The characters!I really felt that they were all real, at my side with Aphrodite saying sarcastic bitchy remarks while at the same time flirting to Darius, Darius being polite and flirting back, Damien saying another wise things, The Twins complaining about Damien on his smartness, Jack busy petting Duchess, Erik acting like he was cold, Heath (I won't forget you! :'( ) trying to get Zoey's attention, Zoey busy stressing about some things and Stark convincing her to relax for awhile. **sighs** I wish I can be in their world.-Writing style!I love how words flow freely like a serene stream, rolling its way towards the river on a spring with flowers blooming, sun shining happily, birds chirping and frogs croaking. Also count bees busy buzzing and the fresh wind blowing around- a perfect peaceful scene I can imagine that'll surely always take my breath away. That is just how amazing P.C. and Kristin Cast wrote this!-The title!Tempted is totally the best word to describe the whole plot of this book. Zoey always feels tempted when Kalona is around for she was the reincarnation of a woman made specifically to love him. But I'm still glad that Zoey managed to overcome the temptation and still choose good over evil.-The moments Zoey and Stark had! (Also the unusual love story of Stevie Rae and Rephaim and the forbidden love story of Darius and Aphrodite).They're just sososoromantic! It never fails to make me squeal! And just remembering how heartbroken and despair Stark felt at the end for failing to protect Zoey just send excruciating pain in my heart.Just like Zoey and Stark, Stevie Rae, Zoey's best friend also had an unusual beginning of a great forbidden love story! And that is with Kalona's favorite son and a Raven Mocker named Rephaim! I love their moments together! It is romantic too! Though I must say Zoey and Stark's moments arewaybetter.Can you imagine an adult vampire and an unique human with visions and a once fledgling can be together? This is proved by Darius and Aphrodite whose love strengthened than any other. And no, they're not like Bella and Edward. Darius and Aphrodite's love story iswaymore better than theirs. Anyway, theirs are so romantic too! But again, Zoey and Stark's love story is the best among the rest!-The ending!Oh goodness! This is my most favorite scene! When they were confronting Kalona, Kalona killing Heath, Heath crumpling to the ground lifeless, Zoey screaming "NO!" and attacked Kalona with her element, spirit; Zoey also crumpling to the ground near Heath, everyone rushing to her side, and finally Stark, her sworn Warrior, crying as he held her soulless body wishing to die for failing his mission to save his High Pritestess. **wipes tears** Truly beautiful! It happened so fast I don't even have time to blink nor to breathe! That's why I said earlier this made me feel breathless!What I Dislike:-There is a particular scene that's not appropriate to readers below 18.Ok, to be specific I'll tell you what kind of scene, sexual harassment. There is this scene that Kalona touched Zoey while on her dream against her will, or maybe some part of her is against it. Goodness, this Zoey-being-the-reincarnation-of-Kalona's-lover is quite confusing! Anyway, so that's what I only dislike in here (if you don't count how major cliffhanger-y the epilogue is).Conclusion:Over all,TemptedbyP.C. CastandKristin Castis a truly amazing sixth installment for theHouse of Nightseries that'll surely leave every reader breathless and this feeling that'll make that particular reader to find time to read for the seventh book. And for this same reason, I'm giving this book five stars!A MUST READ!
