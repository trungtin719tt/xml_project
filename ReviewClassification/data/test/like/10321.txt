As far asOutlandernovels go,Drums of Autumnis the most bodice-ripperish out of the 4 I've read so far. Mainly, because the entire book is plotted around a MISUNDERSTANDING that could have been resolved with one adult conversation. Oh, how I hate those in romance novels!Here is how it goes. In this installment Claire and Jamie are in America establishing a Scottish colony in North Carolina, of course not without a fair share of difficulties and misfortunes. Two hundred years into future Brianna discovers information that forces her to risk her life and travel back in time in secret to visit her parents and possibly change their destiny. Roger, Brianna's fiancee, follows her and the couple immediately consummate their relationship. A mix-up concerning Roger's identity (specifically, his last name) is what drives the main conflict of this novel. This tiny misunderstanding leads to a series of pretty dramatic events.It's not a secret that whileDiana Gabaldonis a great storyteller, she is a weak plotter. She admits so herself, saying that she assembles her book as a puzzle, first writing separate scenes and then piecing them together with a plot. Thus very often her plots are overridden with very unlikely coincidences and sometimes deus ex machina.Drums of Autumnis no exception, but here the entire misunderstanding twist is just way overdone and makes some characters (particularly, to my chagrin, Jamie) act like complete idiots.Another hot button issue for me is this: does every character in theOutlanderseries have to get raped at some point? There is a new addition to the list of Lord John, Jamie, Claire, and Fergus. I mean, enough already with the sexual abuse! I am sure even 200 years ago not everyone was assaulted, right?Brianna and Roger's relationship is given a lot of screen time in this book. Not sure if I care for these two much and believe in their love. Brianna is a pretty unlikable, spoiled, rash person and a source of almost all misfortunes in the story. And poor Roger. He has to go through a lot of pain and suffering for his love.And the last complaint. For a book of this length (1070 pages!) and with such an extensive use of words like "virgin" and "maidenhead,"Drums of Autumnis definitely very light on sex.You might ask why with all these problems I am giving this novel 4 stars? Well, like I said, Gabaldon is a great storyteller. She is so wordy, so descriptive, so in love with the scenes she writes, so self-indulgent to the point, I think, that she doesn't edit out any of her own writing, and yet I am ready to read anything she writes. There is just an addictive, cracktastick quality to her stories. I love being taken on adventure and Gabaldon does just that. I will undoubtedly read the next book, regardless of rapes, deus ex machinas and contrived plots. But can Jamie be not such a possessive dumb-ass inThe Fiery Crossthough? Pretty please?
