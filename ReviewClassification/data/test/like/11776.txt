You never know where you'll find yourself when you pick up one of Haruki Murakami's novels. I've come to believe that's exactly the way it should be. 1Q84 is no exception. The way Murakami weaves history with a constantly evolving reality gives the feel of a speculative novel offering an alternative history. But, besides seeing 2 moons, where is the difference in what the protagonist, Aomame, has dubbed 1Q84 and 'the real' 1984? When Aomame gets out of her taxi and makes an unexpected/out of the ordinary decision, does she really open an alternative 1984 or has Aomame simply opened herself up to experiencing a deeper reality? The cab driver had both warned her that "Things are not what they seem" and "There is always only one reality." The interweaving stories of a math teacher, Tengo, and the 17-year old Fuka-Eri (whose novel Tengo rewrites) add surprises and bizarre twists to this nearly 1,000-page epic. This is a fantastic read about finding yourself and finding love! I highly recommend 1Q84!
