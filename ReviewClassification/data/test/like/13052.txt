I read this one to my kids this year. Of course, they had seen the Disney classic and loved the character. What was surprising in the book was that Poppins comes off as far more bizarre, detached and haughty than she does in the film. It isn't that she doesn't adore the kids, but she also doesn't hesitate to put them in their place and sometimes her anger is more about her own station in life than some misbehavior of the children. There are of course adorable moments and funny incidents in this loose collection of stories that are not really a continuous narrative but some random adventures. The kids enjoyed the book but have not insisted that I grab another copy. Maybe the written version is just a tad bit more mature than the movie version? Up to you to decide I suppose, but as an adult, it is an entertaining read particularly for parents of young kids.
