Picking up where 'City of Bones' left off, 'City of Ashes' doesn't waste any time before plunging you right back into this supernatural world. This book was packed with action and adventure. With ever-changing information and plenty of teenage angst, this cast of characters tries to stay one step ahead of Valentine, making for a highly entertaining read.Still reeling from the news that they're siblings, Jace and Clary struggle with their feelings toward one another. Awkward doesn't begin to describe the dynamic between these two after that cat was let out of the bag. Maybe it's just my wishful thinking, but I'm betting that somewhere down the road we'll find out that they aren't really siblings after all. I just refuse to believe that they won't end up together.While the blooming romance between Jace and Clary came to an abrupt and uncomfortable halt, Simon steps out of the shadows. With Jace out of his way, Simon decides to pursue his feelings for Clary. He's always wanted to be more than just her friend and now is his chance.Soon, Simon finds himself experiencing a major, and unexpected, life change. Nothing will ever be the same for him. He is forever changed, as is his relationship with Clary and everyone he's ever held dear.Like Simon, Clary and Jace begin to discover changes within themselves. Valentine made it clear that they were "different", but didn't give any details. Little by little, they begin to figure out some of their unique abilities. Although it is early-on in this series, it is evident that they are powerful and their full strength is as of yet unknown.Overall, I thought this was a great continuation of this series. I am enjoying these characters more and more as the story evolves. I don't know what is in store for them, but am certain that we've not seen the last of Valentine yet. I'm on to the next audiobook now.
