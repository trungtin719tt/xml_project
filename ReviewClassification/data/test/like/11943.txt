This book pleasantly surprised me! I went into this book expecting it to be just like the movie (which, by the way I love), but it might as well have been a completely different story. The only things it has in common with the movie are the character names, the obsessive shopper and in debt main character, and the title. I adjusted my expectations and thought it would be one of those rare instances where the movie is better than the book, but I loved them equally but in different ways! The book was far less cutesy than the movie as it made Rebecca (the main character) a dislikable character at first. Like really, I hated her. However, she really grows up in 300 pages and even though she still has her flaws, I really began to respect her and want to continue on with the series. As for Sophie Kinsella's writing style, I enjoyed it! She writes everything humorously but with a ring of insight and relatability. I can't wait to read more of her books and she is making me more excited about reading out of the Young Adult genre!
