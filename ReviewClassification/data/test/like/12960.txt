When I reach for a Dr. Seuss,One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fishisneverthe book I reach for. If I need something quick because the kids are late for bed, I grabThe Sneetchesand pick a tale. If there's more time, but I'm still in a hurry,Green Eggs and Hamis the perfect choice. When two year old Scoutie wants a book, I grab the easiest Seuss of them all,Hop on Pop(just as I did when the twins were babes). If I want to have some fun for myself, I grab the tongue twisterrificFox in Socks, and if it's closing in on Christmas,How the Grinch Stole Christmasis the obvious choice.Hell, I am even more likely to read the Seuss-liteGo Dog. GothanOne Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish. But if my kids grab it, and Scoutie's been doing that a lot lately, I'll gladly traverse the bizaare landscape ofOne Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish. Of all Seuss's book, this is the least cohesive. It's just an excuse to rhyme. Nothing more than that. Mr. Brown makes an odd appearance. There's whiny Ned in his too small bed. Yet there's that great line: "From there to here, from here to there funny things are everywhere," and it's some of Seuss's best art. It's a good book. the kids love it, and Scoutie can't get enough.Honestly, I love it too. But I never reach for it and probably never will, which is okay ... it always winds up in my hands somehow.
