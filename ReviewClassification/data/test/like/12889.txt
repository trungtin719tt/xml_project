A beautiful and unconventional love story. I loved Emma. I thought she was funny, intelligent, feisty, and down-to-earth. Took me a while to warm up to Dexter, (he's not a nice guy at first) but when he grew-up emotionally, I found him charming and extremely loyal. This book will make you laugh, cry, and believe that true love is possible. Enjoy! :)
