ReadingThe Magic Mountainis learning to die. Those who live are dying a little, and on this mountain one lives very slowly. It tells the story of Hans Castorp, a young man without many qualities, who the author just does not want to call mediocre. He was a little exhausted by the end of his engineering course. Before assuming a high position in the firm of relatives, he goes to a sanitarium on the mountain to rest for fifteen days, under the pretext of visiting the tubercular cousin. Doctors have discovered that it has the disease in it, and it stays internal as well.Then a transformation takes place in him, gradually, as he goes to live in this place where it seems that time does not exist. In the brief retrospection of his previous life, it is interesting to note the parallel between his biography and that of Thomas Mann, who was also fatherless (distant in Brazil) and, although his mother, indifferent to his relatives. Speaking in the biographical parallel, we will already notice the incredible chapter on the beach walk - this in the mountain, in a place that was covered with snow, even in the summer - as if the mother of the author, brazilian, of Paraty, left in that atavistic feeling of the sea.Get to know the guests of the clinic, which seems to have nothing extraordinary. They are in fact ordinary people who have taken on an incurable disease at the time, and live with it in the best possible way. The better this coexistence, the more normal they seem, the more they gain psychological depth, the more we know how much ordinary human people carry within themselves.How could it not be, there is religious discussion - in the person of two of the most interesting, most complex characters, a writer and a Jesuit, two revelers at first, who grow and dominate the scene. It is the city of God and the city of men in struggle, both charged with errors, trying to justify and impose themselves. The outcome of this dispute will be the climax of the novel. No winners, but with loss and disappointment. However, life goes on.Hans Castorp knows or thinks about knowing love. He does not realize that those who live in their conditions have no right to love. As if to say that those who live in the conditions in which we all live life have no right to love. It is on the eve of World War I, when the world will change. Hans Castorp suddenly matures - that is, we say that time did not exist there, but it is so slowly that the transformations happen in people who, when they see, are already others. As if it were all of a sudden.Nothing could be suddenly in an 800-page book. Nothing could be more surprising in a book of so many pages, in which nothing happens, and that leaves us trapped in that world full of humanity, bleeding unnoticed, dying - and gazes with death - while we go making us richer inwardly. It is not just Hans Castorp that grows throughout the novel. It's not just the characters - not greatness like us - that grow throughout the novel. US too.
