The television series is on "my list" for Netflix and like any reader, I must read the book first. Well, I am now aDr. Laslo Kreizlerfan or should I be more accurate and state that I am a big fan of the pairing between Lazlo and the narrator of the story, crime reporter, John Schyuler Moore. This 19th century mystery about a serial killer hunting down young boys is not for the faint hearted. But oh my goodness, it's incredibly hard to put aside!
