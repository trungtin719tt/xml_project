I really enjoyedA Walk in the Woods, the first book I've read by Bill Bryson. I enjoyed Part 1, where Katz was Bryson's trail companion, more than Part 2 but still liked all of it. The book has a very good balance of story, humor (including plenty of sarcasm), and Appalachian Trail history and information.Hiking the AT (or anything similar really) is something I more than likely would never do. I am a day-nature-r, enjoying outdoorsy activities for the day, usually one day at a time, and if anything, am more of a Glamper than a Camper. While there are plenty of differences,Into the WildandWildare among some of my all-time favorite books, and I'm not surprised I really enjoyed this one too. Perhaps well-written books where the premise is nature-based are enjoyable for me because they're an escape - imagining the immersion in nature while not having to actually participate in the rigorous, physical demands involved in undertaking such a challenge.
