This was a reread but it has been so long that I did not remember much of it at all, so it was just like reading it for the first time.Two of my favourite Discworld characters are Vimes and Vetinari and since they both featured in this book it had to be a success in my mind! I loved the way Pratchett created an alternative past and we got to see Vimes as a young man as well as the well worn cynic that we know so well. Plus a tiny bit of back story for Vetinari did not go amiss.Terry Pratchettwill always be one of my go to authors when I want to read a book I know I will enjoy. Fortunately I have two whole shelves devoted just to him. Such a shame he left us much too soon.
