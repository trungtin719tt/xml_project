Farewell, farewell! But this I tellTo thee, thou Wedding-Guest!He prayeth well, who loveth wellBoth man and bird and beast.He prayeth best, who loveth bestAll things both great and small;For the dear God who loveth usHe made and loveth all.A mariner, returning from a long sea-voyage, engages a man who is attending a wedding, and begins to tell the tale of his sufferings during his journey.
