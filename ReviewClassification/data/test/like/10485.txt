I'm so late to the BDB series, that there's really nothing left for me to say about this book, LOL.Anyway, here's my two cents...I loved Rhage, and that's saying a lot considering that(view spoiler)[he had sex with another woman even though he was already in love with Mary. That should have made me yell "cheater" at the top of my lungs(hide spoiler)]but, due to some miraculous writing by Ms. Ward, it only made me feel sorry for him. I think I even forgave him before Mary did. What was "wrong" with me??? And he actually made me cry - twice! He was just wonderful!*sighs*On the other hand, Mary didn't wowed me that much. She was nice - eventoonice sometimes - but I didn't connect with her. Maybe that was intentional on my part, because I had a hard time reading about her dealing with her leukemia and I ended up skimming through most the scenes where that subject came up. As for her easy acceptance of Rhage's beast, it was unbelievable. Okay, she went through a lot since she'd met Rhage and the Brotherhood, but only a lunatic wouldpeta spitting-mad dragon. But she truly loved Rhage, so I guess that was okay.Regarding the overall story, the UF vibe that I first felt inDark Loverwas present in this book too, and it's starting to bother me. I just don't care about following too many storylines at the same time. I know all that stuff will lead to something important in future books but, by the time I read the next books in the series, I won't remember most of it. Rhage and Mary's love story was beautiful though, and that's what really matters to me. :)
