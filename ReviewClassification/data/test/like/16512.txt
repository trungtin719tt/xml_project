A splendid story of what everyone wants. A new life, a new "me", a new purpose or "any" purpose. A life that means something. The shedding of old skin for glowing new skin. A rejection of all that makes us small, that boxes us in, that is expected. A punch in the face to a civilization that demands we conform. Oh, how I loved this book. It goes in my FOREVER LIBRARY.
