This book was delightful.I'm still reeling from the fact that the author wrote this straight through without knowing all the plot details or how everything would turn out. Sam Westing dies and leaves behind one final game for his 16 heirs who he has move into the same apartment building. A bit Agatha Christie mixed in and you are reading about this puzzle. Everyone is not who they say they are and the author slowly unravels the mystery.For some reason, this took me far longer to read that it should have. It was a quick page turner and the paragraphs switched perspectives almost from sentence to sentence, which made it a little tricky to follow along. There were a lot of characters, which also made it hard to keep them all straight, especially the families. I really enjoyed getting to know how everything played out, and especially the time gaps in the ending. Great book for almost every reader.
