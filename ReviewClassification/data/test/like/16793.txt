This, the final book in Ben Peller's To Live trilogy, is the best yet. I enjoyed the past To Live books... they were funny and well-written. This one blew my socks off. I'm not usually a fantasy reader (although I did love Ender's Game); still I thoroughly enjoyed this book because not only does it put our old friend Shawn Michals in a new and foreign land (far from L.A.) but it also gives him a cool female character to guide him and a mission that mirrors a lot of what seems to be happening in this crazy world we are now living in. Enough said; no spoilers here. Except that this book is VERY worth reading.
