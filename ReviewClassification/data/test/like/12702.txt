This book is one that has sat on my shelf for several years, and I honestly have no idea why I didn't pick it up for so long.Geek Loveis a fantastically interesting novel, with a real focus on character development for the Binewski family, who live in a travelling carnival. The parents have 4 children, and during pregnancy their mother experiments with drugs, alcohol, pesticides, etc. so that her children can be born with various disabilities and deformities that will allow them to bring money in for the carnival.This book is fucked up, as you can imagine from the premise alone. Every character is truly fascinating, and all of the children in particular have such fascinating individual personalities that jump off the page. Although I didn't feel like I was very emotionally connected while reading the majority of the book, towards the end it surprised me how much I felt for these characters (especially with regards to specific plot points that I won't spoil).The majority of the book follows the family in chronological order, but there are a couple of chapters that follow the character of Olympia (our narrator) later in life, and those were the only parts that didn't hold my interest as much. If those sections hadn't been there, this would have been a 4.5 star rating at least. Overall though it was a fascinating and exhilarating read, and one I would recommend to everyone who considers themselves to have a semi-strong stomach.
