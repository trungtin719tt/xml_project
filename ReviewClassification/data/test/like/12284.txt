"They say there's no harm in daydreaming, but there is."There's trouble in paradisewhen Bill Compton is ordered to take on atop secret and super time consuming projectgiven by thevampire Queen of Louisiana, Lorena. Giving him the time and space he needs to work, Sookie Stackhouse doesn't realize her boyfriend is missing until Eric Northmen and his two most trusted co-workers, Pam and Chow, pay her a visit.They also clue her in on someother interestinginformation:Bill hinted to Eric about leaving and Bill and Lorena have a romantic history together (they're blood bonded, which is a rare and ill advised thing to do between vamps).Having an idea of where to find him, Eric sends Sookie to Jackson, Mississippi with a werewolf who owes him a favor, Alcide Herveaux. There, she'll stay in his apartment and visitClub Dead(club Josephine's) to scope out the club goers using her telepathic abilities. Luckily for her, Sookie has Alcide, Eric, and Bubba (vampire Elvis Presley) watching her back, becauseshe gets into all sorts of troubleon this trip. Between being physically assaulted by a werewolf in the club, finding said werewolf mysteriously dead in Alcide's closet, and being staked by Steve Newlin in the process of saving the king of Mississippi's second in command, Betty Jo Pickard,things arenotgoing asplanned.Fortunately, Russell Edginton (vampire king of Mississippi) feels obligated to help Sookie for saving his second in command, and for being attacked by a werewolf in his jurisdiction. He takes Eric (who pretends to be someone else) and Sookie to his mansion to rest and heal. Bubba,still obediently carrying out his orders, follows Sookie there and learns that Bill is being held prisoner in one of Edginton's buildings. The three come up with a rescue plan to save Bill and itworks...But they're not out of hot water just yet.They still need to survivethe ruthless werewolves who want to avenge their missing pack member and figure out who killed him. There's also the matter of Alcide's jealous on-and-off shapeshifter girlfriend, Debbie Pelt, who, despite being engaged to another shifter, wants to take Sookie out of Alcide's life for good. Then of course there's the fact that Bill cheated on Sookie with Lorena, and was even planning on leaving her with out a word.Emotionally and physically drained, Sookie recinds both Bill's and Eric's invitations as an attempt to separate herself from all the chaos. Realizing just then that she still has Bill's secret project hidden in her house and nowno vampire can access it.This book does start offslow, but the second half ispacked with action! There's a lot of good character development in Club Dead, which allowed me to feel more connected to them, as well as introductions to new characters. There are some humorous parts in this book, but all the romantic drama gave it more of a "serious" feel.I'm not a big fan of Bill's, so I wasgladthat he was pretty much MIA for most of this installment. I was also happy that in betraying Sookie for his ex lover, Lorena also betrays him (serves him right!lol). His absence and betrayal allowed Sookie to become closer to Alcide and Eric. There was a lot of fun "will they - won't they?" tension between the three. While I'm rooting for Eric (for now, anyway.) I think anyone would pretty much be better for Sookie than Bill. I can't say that I hate him, but he's just so bland, and boring and...Ugh!Bubba (vampire Elvis Presley) was introduced inDead Until Dark, but in this installment of the Sookie Stack house Mysteries he's become one of my favorite characters.I like Alcide's character and look forward to seeing him in the other books of Charlaine Harris' series, but all that "real women" and "real man" talk gotannoying. It was easy enough to look past I suppose, but it still left a bad taste in my mouth. There was also a comment made by Sookie, concerning being an American and torture that also didn't sit well with me.
