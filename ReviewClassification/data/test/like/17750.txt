Holy crap! Why are P. D. Eastman books so long?! (No wonder my mom always hated reading usAre You My Mother?Seventy-two pages make for alongpicture book.)There's no real story toGo, Dog. Go!It's basically just a book of colours, sizes, prepositions, etc. featuring a multitude of dogs. There's plenty to look at. There's a repeating element of two dogs meeting and one asking the other if they like their hat. The pictures are interesting, and clearly show what the dogs are doing.I'm not sure if this is really a book for storytime, or if it's more of a book that kids will want to look at on their own. (It's long for storytime, in any case.) I have vague memories of reading this one as a kid, but they're not strong enough for me to remember whether I liked it or not! As an adult, I found it okay, but I would dread reading this one aloud. It's just a bit long. And if there were an actual story, I might like it even more.Quotable moment:
