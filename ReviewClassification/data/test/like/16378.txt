3.5 starsI am gladDavid LevithanjoinedJohn Greento create this story, because clearly Green is unable to write any other characters different from what he had already offered inLooking for Alaska,Paper TownsandAn Abundance of Katherines. His Will Grayson is the same old nerdy, too eloquent boy who is into a smart, attractive, and slightly pretentious girl. Green simply cannot move on to any other ensemble.Levithan's Will Grayson, on the other hand, is a breath of fresh air with a whiff of depression. He is a loner, a tad mentally unstable, but funny in a sarcastic kind of way. I have read a ton of YA lit and still I think this character is quite unique.The story itself is a great blend of Green's and Levithan's styles. Essentially, it is about both Wills romantic entanglements, their struggles to connect, to commit and to move on. There are great, difficult friendships and realistic parents. There are gay characters that are not cliches. And there is a fantastical, over-the-top, gay-licious ending in a form of a high school musical (I bet, courtesy ofDavid Levithan) - my least favorite part of the novel, BTW.The book is funny too, or maybe its audio narrators just did a marvelous job reading it. Either way, I did enjoy it. A lot.
