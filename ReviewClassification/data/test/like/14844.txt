Living in the Willamette Valley I had several occasions to see Ken Kesey -- in downtown Eugene, at the MacDonald Theater, and even at the Saturday Market. He enjoyed a local following that elevated him and his friends to an almost rock-star status. My husband had gone to high school with his son and described a Ken Kesey separate from the Merry Prankster charter member and that public persona.One late spring afternoon, we were driving from Springfield towards Pleasant Hill, and came up on a big old convertable -- maybe a Caddy -- with the man at the helm with a grin on his face and the wind ruffling his greying hair. As we took the turns on the windy, rural road behind the big car, I noticed it was Kesey. Struggling at that time with my undone want to write and my fear of a future as a bank employee or an accountant or something equally as awful and cubicleized -- I was so impressed by Kesey's peaceful smile that it encouraged me to continue with my art. I wanted that same peacefilled, unworried smile that I imagined could only come from letting that level of creativity out into the world.Instead of the Merry Prankster, I choose to remember Kesey as the creativity-filled young man who spent time in the logging communities of Mapleton and Noti -- learning about the people and the communities and the way of life he wrote about in this book.
