Wow. It's actually over.*sighs* What a journey.The first time I readHush, Hushback a couple years ago, I fell in love with it. Over the years, we've had our ups and downs, but I can honestly say that this series is my favorite paranormal romance out of all. It may not be the best, but I loved it. And to see it end really saddens me.The previous book,Silence, kind of disappointed me so I was really hoping that the last book would be better. And it was. There were a lot of shocks and many secrets were revealed. And even though I had forgotten a lot of the details, I didn't have a problem continuing the story. However, the middle of the book really dragged along. I got a bit bored. Even when something did happen, I wasn't all excited. But the best parts were when the secrets were revealed - I had my theories, and some of them turned out to be true.As for Nora...*sighs*. Again, I found her annoying here. No surprise. I mean, I love her and all, but sometimes she can be really selfish and hotheaded. What bothers me the most about her is the way she treats her enemies. I'm really glad she's not one of those characters who sit back and let others walk all over her, but the way she talks back to them and the things she says don't make her sound any better than them. She sounded really bitchy when she was going off on Marcie or Dabria. True, they're not exactly nice people and have done some very bad things to Nora, but I wished that Nora didn't have to act that way as well. Even when it wasn't Nora's fault, some of her actions and decisions still bugged me. She changed a lot since the beginning of the series, but not all changes were good. But what I do like about Nora is her determination to do the right thing, even when she's terrified to do it. Also, she was pretty badass there at the end.And Patch. Wow. I really wished that this series continued, just so I could read more of his smexiness. I know that I'm definitely gonna go over the whole series and re-read his parts. *grins*Oh yeah, and also...(view spoiler)[SCOTTIE THE HOTTIE DIES. WHAAAAAAT?! I had started to like him more and more and I especially liked his brother-sister relationship with Nora. And when he died...I was really shocked. I wanted him and Vee to stay together! Oh well. At least he died a hero.(hide spoiler)]So long,Hush, Hushseries. It was a great ride. One that I'll never forget.3.5/5
