This is a short novel but it contains a lot of reflection on grief, pain and friendship. It reminded me in some ways ofTo Kill a Mockingbird. In both cases, a father is left to take care of his child(ren) without the help of a mother. And in both cases, a young girl, observant but not omniscient, grapples with problems and mysteries much bigger than she is, and gradually works her way toward a solution. The dog, Winn-Dixie, who is bigger than life and twice as goofy, is not so much the main character as the catalyst which brings out the best in most of the other characters.There is in this little book a sweetness mixed with sadness, not unlike the quasi-magical candies which provoke a similar evaluation in almost everyone who samples them.
