What an awesome book to listen to on a very long car trip! The narrator was incredible. He was able to change up voices and input just the right amount of pomposity into Bartimeus' character to make him both believable and humorous. For those looking for a book in a similar vein to the Harry Potter series, this story of a young apprentice magician is a must read. I would recommend the audio version to children ages 9+. The parents in the car enjoyed the story, too.This audio book was downloaded from audiobooksync.com as part of their Summer 2012 free audio book promotion.See what other audio books made our Road Trip playlist and what we thought of them onBadass Book Reviews.
