Second Re-read: January 2018First Re-read: December 2014Actual Rating:All the Bloody StarsIntensely MasculineFucking CataclysmConstant JackassTireless LoverWithout LimitStormy NightAbsoluteJerichoSexualWinterCarnalJZBHe exists in a place that is beyond all rules for me.This series is so good I actually had to clean my schedule to re-read it.It consumes your time, life and soul.You don't exist anymore.Somewhere along book #2 or #3 you stop being a serious, respectable and admirable woman. You give yourself to the biggest jackass in the history of UF and you enjoy very single second of it.What can I say to convince you to read this book I haven't already said?In my first read, I was so obsessed by the questionwhat is Barrons?I couldn't properly appreciate the compelling writing, the amazing world-building and KMM's great execution. This time, I relaxed and enjoyed the view. And by view, I mean Barrons.The best part of this Re-read, and I completely mean it, is theBest Fever Buddy Readin the history and an amazing bunch of new friends I found there. Things got pretty crazy over there. One minute we were discussing the how's and why's and then BAM! the next thing you know we've got a whole thread reserved for Barron's hotness only ^^We're reading Iced on Dec 22. I'm ready for some Dani and Ryodan!______________________________________First Read: November 2013*Spoiler Free*This is a note for everybody out there who hasn't read this series yet:First of all, how dare you?You know, there's a moment in life when you find the best series you've read so far. And you can't let it go without freaking out, big time. You find people as crazy as you, you look for more reading material and even faint with the news of TWO more books. I should know, it happened to me. I've just foundTHE BEST FREAKING UF SERIES I'VE EVER READand for that I'll always worship KMM. I will because reasons.And no, the reason is not Barrons. I won't lose the respect I've earn among GR's friends just saying that Barrons' body(view spoiler)[and #literalmagicpenis(hide spoiler)]is the reason for 5 stars. I won't even mention that since I started this series I've been having this crazy dreams that always begins with Barrons saying "Hello, Miss Liz. Who am I?". Stop thinking I've been googling my personal Barrons in the web frustrated because they are not dark enough, intense enough, flawless enough. And if by some chance I'd have finally found my Barrons I wouldn't admit anything about my mobile's wallpaper.I guess I'm trying to say that there are more than just one reason this series is so epic. And that's KMM. She is a freaking genius that planned the whole series before she even began to write it, unlike some others writers. You can tell they were just improvising there."Hell, let's kill the MC in the most anticlimactic way ever just to see what happens! The plot? ...right, I'll figure it out later!""I wrote a fanfic a while ago. Fuck it, I'm using it for an ENDLESS series. There could be a prequel, a sequel and a sequel's prequel!"While reading this series I knew I'd have to re-read it as soon as possible because obviously KMM was a teaser, an evil woman who enjoyed watching me in pain and when all hope was lost, when all the lights had faded she gave me +500 pages of delicious ambrosia and I loved every. Single. Moment. Of it.(view spoiler)[Barrons and a barbecue? Guys, my love life is screwed for ever. I won't ever be happy so I'll just accept it and move on. Until 2016, Bloody Fucking Sexy Jackass.(hide spoiler)]
