I watched Starship Troopers first. I found it amusing, gory, action based and fluffy. When I read the book I wondered if the directer/script writer had read the same one I had. Turns out that he never finished this book and made the story up as he saw fit. Suddenly everything made sense to me.As far as pacing and plot go, you won't find any of that here. There isn't much of a plot to this book and the story arc, so to speak, is more like a low lying limbo poll. Straight and short.What I absolutely loved about this book, though, is the characters and message to this book. Of course, Heinlein's theories about citizenship and government are seriously flawed. But they're fascinating (if you like that sort of thing) and the description of military life is both rich and well depicted. Of course, you have to have a passion for both the military AND theory of government to enjoy this book.If not, put it down and go read Twilight.
