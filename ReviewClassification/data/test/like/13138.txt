I didn't go online, hardly talked, didn't eat (ok so I did eat), didn't watch TV just so I could finish this book. So basically I spent the whole day reading and I'm just bursting at the seams to read the next one.The tension in the book is so great that you feel like the characters are literally going to break from the strain. Clary's mother is still in a coma and her relationships with Simon and Jace are fragile. At one point you just feel so down for everyone. Clary seemed to be getting in the way sometimes. Like she is more a liability rather than an asset. No worries in the end we get to see some real gumption from her. It's ever changing who is my favorite. I'll be thinkingIsabelle is my favorite wait...no Max he's really cute but....Luke is great...then again Simon is just so painfully loyal, so I still don't have a clear favorite. I think it's because each and everyone of the characters have their own great scenes, so it's close to impossible to choose.We see the same quick action sequences, same hilarious sarcastic remarks, and the same heart. Granted it can get over dramatic but that's why we are all reading it! I just think it's precious how with all their shadowhunter abilities they still have to rely on mundane technology, like cell phones. I must say they find themselves in some pretty sticky situations; the people and the cell phones. Jace is growing on me and Valentine is definitely getting more evil. One thing that kind of bothered me was that Valentine doesn't seem too clever. He hasn't done anything like WOW I didn't see that coming. He is suppose to be overthrowing the whole Clave, so he's got to be ultra smart right? Another little irk I had was when Simon was gone for the whole night or a good chunk of the day from his house, we never see the explanation he gives his mom. In the real world he would have to deal with that, but as the reader I get the impression that his mom doesn't care. I doubt that's the case though. Oh and doeseverythinghave to taste, smell, and look like metal? Just saying...We are getting some serious hints that Jace's lineage is not what we think it is and I'm glad to see Simon trying to be the bigger person, however hard that may be. I definitely thought the second one was better than the first. New characters, more knowledge, and closer to seeing how this is all going to turn out. Bring it on because I'm ready for more!
