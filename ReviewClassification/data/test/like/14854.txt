This is a fine book, well crafted in character and plot development, key points of symbolism and total command of setting and historical circumstance. It gabs yer gut in the right places and lets go with a throaty hallelujah when ridden off. Kesey knows his woods like Richard Powers' tree bible only from opposing sides which brings me to a salient query: isn't it funny, strange, mystical, etc., how books bleed into each other? I didn't plan to read Saragamo's "Cain" followed by Steinbeck's "EoE" followed by Kesey's own more subtle twist on biblical Cain &amp; Abel metamorphoses (Ovid's book too) spin. Just like those (Powers) trees communicating to each other, attentive, free-wheeling readers riding that perpetual wave of euphoric imagination catch a 'notion' of where next to go unbeknownst as where one goes many the time, a casual blink here, a nod from there, here, read this next! Magic, sort of.
