How many times have I seen a version of A Christmas Carol? Probably too many times to count, but I can try:- A stage version at least half a dozen times- The Disney version with Scrooge McDuck- The Disney version with Jim Carrey- A Muppet Christmas Carol- Scrooged with Bill Murray- Probably more that I am forgettingFinally, I have taken it upon myself to read the source material! Did I like it? Two words: BAH, HUMBUG!In Dickens-ese that means I did. I have enjoyed pretty much every adaptation I have seen and, in general, they seem very close to the original story. So, I have no complaints!One thing you will find with the book is that each ghost has one or two more scenes that they show Scrooge. It seems like adapters of the book have generally agreed on which stories to leave out as I don't think I was familiar with any of the "new" tales.Do you love Christmas stories? Classics? Adaptations of this story? I am not saying you should read this, I am saying you pretty much have to!
