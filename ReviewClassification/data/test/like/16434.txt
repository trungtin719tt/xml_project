Yet again Colleen Hoover has made me feel so many feels all at once. I went from happy to sad, laughing to crying so many times. I loved the characters, I loved the story line, I loved everything.The book is written in dual POV with Tate's written in the present and Miles' written in the past. This helps give you a clearer view on why Miles feels the way he does, even though you don't actually find out what happens until the end of the book.Believe it or not, I actually loved Miles and Tate's relationship. Sure it was mostly physical, but you can tell they both really cared for each other, no mater how much Miles said he didn't. You can tell from the start that Miles has some sort of troubled past and a huge secret. It broke my heart that Miles felt he couldn't love anyone after what happened. But in this process, Tate is trying to hide her feelings, leaving her feeling hurt by Miles.
