Water, water, everywhere,And all the boards did shrink;Water, water, everywhere,Nor any drop to drink.That is the the line (or are the lines) that stick in my mind.I read this poem years ago elementary school (the late 60s). I was already developing a taste for fantasy literature. Where I lived at the time books in general were a little hard to come by, the school library was about my only source and this was a small rural school. I had searched out Arthurian fiction, looked up all manner of folklore in encyclopedias, found mythology (loved Norse) and so on. This was a wonderful find and I hadn't thought of it in years. I'm not really worried that "poetry aficionados" may not be thrilled with it (if they aren't) I'd recommend that if you haven't read it you find it and try it.
