DTProject2017 | Book 4What a rideThe 2nd longest book in the series, after the last one, and my favourite; the last one comes next.This book starts exactly where the 3rd book stopped, a massive cliffhanger.And everything that happens in it takes place in less than 1-2 days.Out of the 845 pages, 219 of them (25.91%) are the actual story andout of the 845 pages, 626 of them (74.08%) are the (story within a story), the tale of Roland's youth, the one he narrates to them in the course of one night; for me it was almost a week.This story, the one from Roland's youth, is a bittersweet story, it's a story of teenage love, of growing up, of facing your destiny or ka.A story in which I was constantly feeling a knot in my stomach. An ache that was my companion all along.In this book we see Roland becoming more human than ever. He isn't anymore the (almost) nameless, featureless gunslinger of the first book (which was actually 5 short stories in one published first in a serial, just like Dickens's books; another great storyteller often compared with King), he is human, loved by his new ka-tet (fellowship brought together by destiny(ka) ) and he loves them back. I love them too.We will rendezvous again in the 5th book, by the end of May, when the sun will be brighter and hotter, when the story will be darker and colder.Oh, and Mr KingI'm your number one fan*smiles*If you ever end up in my house I willforceyou to bring back Susan. I don't have a typewriter, so bring one from Bangor. Let me remind you that I do have a sledgehammer at home. It belonged to my granddad. And I'll use it; If you refuse to write the cockadoodie revision, BECAUSE IT ISN'T FAIR!God, I love you
