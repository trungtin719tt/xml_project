Don't judge me, but the first time I have read Uglies, David was a character I didn't like at all, but I ended up having my mind completely changed about him. I honestly wanted more of him and Tally and I expected them to at least share a kiss (for the sake of my little fangirl soul).On the other hand, Zane was someone I didn't enjoy reading about as much as I thought I would, and his and Tally's relationship was really boring for me in some parts.Even though it was a good and fast read I more or less loved, dear mr. Westerfeld, you can't top Uglies with this sequel.I am really looking forward to the last book in this series (+ Extras).
