I read this as an introduction toFrakenstein- I had trouble getting into the story, but eventually let go of reality and immersed myself in Coleridge's phenomenal writing."Water, water, everywhere,And all the boards did shrink;Water, water, everywhereNor any drop to drink."My peers joked that Coleridge wroteThe Rime of the Ancient Marinerwhile under an opium-induced haze. I think the drug may have affected his perspective when crafting this, but I doubt he wrote the entire poem under the influence. If he did, I'm jealous."The very deep did rot: O Christ!That ever this should be!Yea, slimy things did crawl with legsUpon the slimy sea."I shivered upon my first time reading that - so gross, yet so beautifully written. I'm glad my English teacher had us read this despite that it wasn't in the required curriculum.Want to read more of my reviews? Follow mehere.
