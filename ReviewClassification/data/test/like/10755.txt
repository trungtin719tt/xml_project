Third Read: Five stars! (December 2015)Second Read: 3.5 stars (December 2014)First Read: Four stars (September 2014)New thoughts on third read: I'll keep it brief. For whatever reason, I was totally in the mood for this re-read and everything really worked for me. All the angst that bugged me last time, it didn't bother me, and in fact, I LOVED it. I loved dark Mac 5.0 and her ugly struggle with herself and with learning to trust Barrons. This book made me cry and maybe I'm just feeling emotional right now, but it all worked so much more this time.I had totally forgotten just HOW much happens in this book. SO many questions are answered. It's very satisfying. Very. If you haven't gotten into the series by now, this is not going to convert you because it's written in the same way. It's not a perfect book, and there are a few spots where it seem "long," but it wraps up the whole arc from books 1-4, and leaves you wanting more.Karen Marie Moning writes very good in an emotionally-charged manner. I really felt for Mac and her and Barrons are just so fucking epic together. Sigh. I lurv them.Buddy Re-read with theMacHalo group, officially starting Monday, December 21, 2015, but some of us are starting early because that's the way we roll.New thoughts for second read:Now I remember why I couldn't give this book 5 stars... the hot-cold interactions with Barrons and Mac got too infuriating for me. I mean, we're at book 5 now right, and at times, it seemed like we had an intense scene where things were going to change with them and then we went straight back to where we were in book 1. That starts to feel like the author is just using certain tactics to play with reader emotions.There is *no* doubt the last part of this book is un-put-downable. It's explosive and amazing. But for such a long book, it just meandered too much and Mac's inner ramblings became tedious. Readers want Barrons - and of COURSE we do. He is the best part of the series, basically. But it begins to feel like the author is being stingy about him for most of this book. Yes, we got many answers and the scenes Barrons WAS in were the best ones. For book 5, it just felt like we were still getting too much angst and drama in their relationship.Original reviewSo, that was pretty epic.This was a really long book that kind of felt overwhelming. The pacing was a little off at times and it meandered in ways that I found distracted me. But that was mainly ok overall. *Everything* is answered in this one, and I don't think I've ever read a book in a series that was so dense with vital information. Everyone's motivation, backstory, histories, reveals, etc. It's all here. I'm still not sure how I feel. Hold on, I need a drink.(view spoiler)[ I am happy with how things end with Mac and Barrons. Very happy. The earlier angst between them was starting to get to me so I am very happy all that is behind us. Not sure how I feel about V'lane being the big bad. He was always sketchy, but I kind of liked him. Now that I know he was never actually V'lane, and was in fact the evil Unseelie Prince, Cruce (and is a rapist), I can never like him in the earlier books during re-reads. I am very happy Rowena and Fiona got what was coming to them. Barron's son = mindblown.(hide spoiler)]I'll probably add to this review later. There was just too much to process in one read.
