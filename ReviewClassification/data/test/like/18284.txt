I have finally finished the series that many kids in this country grew up on. But being 26 didn't negate the fact that I really loved this series. I didn't rate all the books a five, and I was constantly annoyed with her random writing style (look who's talking...), and there were times I was confused as to who was who and when (not where) we were. But they were truly amazing. Especially the last two. I guess Many Waters was never a part of the original trilogy, and chronologically, it actually happens before A Swiftly Tilting Planet. For actual reviews, see each book individually on my bookshelf.I will say this though. There are so many wonderful Christian truths in these books, and characters that are real. They actually struggle, or get frusterated, or chose sin because it's easy, and deny the truth because it's not logical. And I like that, but she always brings it back to God's Word. She just interweaves Christian theology so effortlessly into her stories that you walk away with very profound truth. I won't let my kids make the same mistake I did by not reading these books until later in life. They will most certainly be a staple alongside Narnia and the Penderwicks. A true classic.
