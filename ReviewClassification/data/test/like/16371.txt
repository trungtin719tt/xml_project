Silas Marner is the most accessible of George Eliot's novels, by which I mean it isn't like 700 pages long, which is a problem for it because that also means it's the one you had to read in high school. You didn't like it. Partly because your teacher made the whole class take turns reading out loud -why would you do that?- and partly because even at her snappiest Eliot is not the world's most exciting writer. She is the world's smartest writer! So that's nice for her. But she's noDumas.And this is no Middlemarch. That book isthe best one ever written;this is just very good. It's an exploration of how this one guy, Silas Marner, fits into and then out of and then back into society. Silas is a loner, and the book looks at a few things a person can focus on to give his life meaning. Money both works (in that it keeps him alive) and doesn't (in that it has no actual ability to give back). The atheist Eliot makes a quiet point that religion isn't crazy helpful either; those are motions. They represent community that's helpful, but aren't intrinsically helpful. And then she ends by saying that love in whatever way you can find it is the most helpful. Which is true but also sentimental, and the book is a little sentimental, but okay. Eppie gives Silas a focus all by herself, but she also draws him out and into the community, which Eliot clearly thinks is equally valuable.And as a bonus, there's a really lovely bit about Godfrey(view spoiler)[&amp; Nancy's inability to have a kid. Eliot has perceptive things to say about what it means to have all these love and resources available and no proper outlet for them. She doesn't spend much time on Godfrey's maturation, but she sketches it out in some short and effective strokes; he starts as a jackass, and by the end he's slightly less of a jackass(hide spoiler)]. He's a good example of Eliot's bottomless, all-encompassing understanding of humans.If you're a grownup and you're thinking of exploring or revisiting Eliot, by all means read Middlemarch. But if you're too much of a wuss, you can read this instead. It's good stuff.
