I honestly have no idea why, but there was something about this book (I guess the adventure?) that I absolutely loved when I was younger.Really cute story of two kids that run away to live in a museum, skirting the cops and sleeping in the priceless beds and having a series of adventures in the museum!If you like this and want more, visit my blog, Literary Cafe:www.literarycafe.weebly.com
