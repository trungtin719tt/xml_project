Let me explain, I hate writing in books. I think it sullies the text, I think it mires the next reader's experience and I think it aesthetically just doesn't look good. But never have I written more in a book then in this one. Written notes, underline, bracketed, I went off the rails on this one and why? Because I had to just to keep up? Partially but more than that; I think it was because I wanted to grow along with Arjuna in the book as Krishna dropped his wisdom on the both of us and to distinguish myself from Arjuna's whiny little self at the beginning. I did stop writing toward the end but my enjoyment of the text did not diminish for it.What I loved about this book, story, parable or what have you is that this is how I want to approach faith and religion. I think there are so many people that as Krishna points out get so caught up in the scripture that they miss the point. I realize at the same time though that accomplishing the goals of action without desire or thought of result is a true journey and a task far beyond me as I am now, but it's definitely worth striving for. It's better to do your duty poorly than someone else's duty exceptionally. I like that idea and I don't think it's individualistic because charity and worship and a part of it, but it's important to think of the Self rather than the self.This will not be a one-time read nor can it really if I want to really understand the whole thing. Admittedly the gunas are confusing as hell and a few other things but probably with time and further understanding of the world and its beautiful people I'll come to appreciate this book the more and more I read it.
