This is a really beautifully written story.I've purchased this book no less than 4 different times. Every time someone saw it they wanted to borrow it and somehow it never got returned. My mother-in-law filched the last copy I bought and sheSWEARSit belongs to her.I picked up yet another copy to take away with me and read while traveling and am truly enjoying re-discovering just how wonderful it is to read Pat Conroy.I'm so pleased to have picked this book up again. What a joy to read such artfully crafted prose. Conroy's writing is exquisite.
