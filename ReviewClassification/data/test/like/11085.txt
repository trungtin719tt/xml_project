*5 stars*5 stars*5 stars*5 stars*I have always enjoyed reading UF series, especially the ones containing a bit of mystery. Exactly likeDarynda Jones' series of Charley Davidson. It may not be a surprise that I likedDarkfever, but it is one that I seriously couldn't put it down! I shouldn't have started it yesterday at 11PM, even if it was a friday night. You see, sleep is important to me. I actually had to drag myself to bed and convince myself that tomorrow is another day, that I'll have plenty of time to read and that nothing's going to happen to my heroine that I wouldn't know eventually about.Of all the UFs I've read in my life, (Queen Betsy, Charley Davidson, Night Huntress, Parasol Protectorate,...) this one had, in my opinion, the best and most interesting worldbuilding. I mean, fairies? Yes. Dark and lethal fairies? Gimme gimme!! Also, I liked the fact that there were many different settings and not principally in a specific place like my latest read book,Cruel Beauty(which was also a very good but quite different book.)The characters were very entertaining and riveting. And there were quite some to fantasize about. A reason why I love reading urban fantasy series is that they remind me of action-packed TV shows. And I can never get enough of them. I love seeing the character developpements from the first to the final books. I like my heroines kick-ass, smart and independent so Mackayla Lane was a bright shinning star for me.I think I'm in the minority here, but I didn't get all crazy and fangirl on Jericho as most of you who read this book may did. Maybe I was supposed to succumb at his charm, but I didn't. Maybe it's because of the fact that him and Mac didn't meet at an interesting moment for me. And a book shop? Meeeh. I love book shops, but it's just not the place I was expecting. I may not have swooned over him, but he definitely was a nicely built and thought of character. My own personal fantasy is V'lane:To every person who has yet to read this book, do so. I'm (almost) positively sure you will be a satisfied reader and will enjoy it in one way or another.Happy reading!
