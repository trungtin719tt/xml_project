That was the winter of 2011. It had been harsh, cloudy and too foggy. I lived on the outskirts of my city then for few months and apart from the luxurious noon sunlight and biting cold, there wasn't much happening around. I ran to my sacred haven. There I met Robert Ludlum's Jason Bourne. The winter will be always remembered fondly!I liked everything about this book. Since I opened it without much knowledge (yup, I was too ignorant then) so it turned out to be colorful firecrackers in the small box.Since the very opening on the island it piques readers' interest. The dramatic scenes, Bourne's unexplained money and combat skills he has no knowledge of, come in handy. On the pavements of Paris and on the roads of the USA the chameleon roams with equal gait and skills. The shadows of a powerful controlling assassin, Carlos, are intriguing too. I found it so marvelous I can go in each detail and tell how it's perfectly carved hologram of Robert Ludlum's writing. ( The only complaint  was  the names seemed copied after other legendary spy, James Bond. JB. Well, they both share many characteristics of great spy so similarities are welcome. And coming to movies, Bourne series is said to be "loosely based on novels" don't count. The books are far supreme by any comparison.I read three of them in succession often finding myself stark awake till early mornings. The later books of series are written by another author and don't have the same speed, grip, thrill and intricate plotting. I read them too because Jason Bourne had made a strong impact in very first rendezvous. When I heard Ludlum is on Dan Brown's admiration list, I wasn't amazed. That fits just perfect!BTW, just checking reviews of my GR friends. Happy to see they all gave it thumbs up with 4+star!
