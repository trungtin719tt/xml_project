What a book! I thought okay so an odd storyline when I heard about it. But my book group was saying it was so good that I thought I would give it a try and I'm soooo glad that I did. This book makes you glad to be a reader. For me it brought stories and that love of a really really good book to life again. I am about halfway through it and I keep making me put it down because I dread it ending.Andrew Davidson has written a gift for the reading world. His stories sweep you up and place you there and that's a rare treat. I remember being a young girl and feeling that sensation..discovering that magic! Share this book with the people you know. It's awesome. Thank you Mr. Davidson!
