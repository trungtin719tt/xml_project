I find it funny that after nearly a decade passed since I last devoured this series, I come on Goodreads and everyone's trashing it. Would it make me less credible if I gave this 4 stars? Should I be caring? I wanted to give this 5 stars but after reading through a few irate reviews I decided to take it down a notch. But I loved it so much when I was a kid, I had fantasies of being Max and everything. Sad that it has lost its magic now that I'm all Grown Up.
