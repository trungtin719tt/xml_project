I really love this series. I think these were the first multiple perspective books I ever read and I really adored being back in the world of Lena, Tibby, Bee &amp; Carmen. I feel like everyone can cast themselves as one of the girls, or at least a mixture of them.This is the story of the first summer the girls spend apart, each going on different adventures and stepping out into the world of grown-ups and real life. The first book takes place over the summer of their 15th (almost 16) year. We see each of the girls go through a multitude of growth and life experience and Ann's honestly is really refreshing.I kind of wish more contemporary books where like this - less angsty and more awkward, full of mistakes and OOPS moments :)I also listened to the audiobook for parts of the story and I really recommend it! I thought it was really well done.When I was younger, I would have said I was a Bee/Carmen kind of girl, but now that I'm older and know myself a little better, I'm actually a Lena/Carmen kind of girl! What about you?I definitely give this book 5 stars, though I admit my rating will never be unbiased, as I read these books as a teenager and have such an affinity for them in my heart!
