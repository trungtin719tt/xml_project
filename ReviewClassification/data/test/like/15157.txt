Looking for a great thriller? Look no further, the train has arrived. Paula Hawkins has written a tightly woven mystery with painful secrets and startling truths reveled along the way.The main character Rachael, is a heavy drinker, whose life is teetering on the edge. She has lost her husband, and her job. Yet, she continues to ride the train into the city every day, pretending to go to work. Along the way, Rachael creates a story about a perfect couple who's home backs the tracks, a home just a few houses down from where she lived with her husband.Enter Megan, who's story begins one year before Rachael's. I must confess, I got a little confused with the dates interspersed throughout the story, but realized the author was using them cleverly. Meagan's story seems to move quickly forward, while Rachael's, very slowly. I thought they were a perfect analogy for two trains on different tracks, bound to converge at some point along the way. And converge they do. Megan goes missing on a day Rachael has drank herself into a black out. What has happened to Megan and what does her story have to do with not only Rachael herself, but also her fantasy story of the perfect couple?This is definitely a thriller that keep me moving quickly through the pages. I wasn't completely satisfied with the ending, but also, loved the authors ability to keep the story bound to a short list of characters. I have no doubt this will be a big hit for thriller fans.
