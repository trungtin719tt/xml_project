Ahh, the story of Twoflower and the "failed" wizard Rincewind. Although calling Rincewind a "failed" wizard is possibly not really fair to him as he's only a "failed" wizard because having sneaked a look at a forbidden spell book one the 8 Great Spells has taken up the room in his brain that would be needed for other spells and he can't get it out, at least not without casting it, and since neither he nor the other wizards know what it will do...destroy the world, the universe, the multiverse...or possibly something less drastic, it doesn't seem like the best option.Anyway Rincewind becomes the guide (at a wage so high as to be mythical) to the Disc World's first tourist (and possibly last as he seems bent on getting himself and Rincewind killed).Pratchett has a wonderful turn of phrase and an oddly quirky mind that is endlessly inventive.I want to comment on something else here also. It seems that most who write Synopses (I always feel that should be "synopsi")anyway, they seem to think that a great thing to say about a book is that it is "irreverent"it is I believe said about almost all Pratchett's work in almost every synopsis. Okay, I'm a Christian and while Sir Terry is apparently more on the atheistic side of things I detect no rancor in his work. Yes he skewers the idiosyncrasies of religions in general and some things in specific but I don't ever get a since of "hate" or even condescension. I have enjoyed several of his works and while I would almost undoubtedly disagree with him on these things, I don't think I would dislike him and I don't think he "dislikes" people simply on the grounds that they are religious.Judge for yourself.
