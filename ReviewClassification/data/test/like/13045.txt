Quick review of the audio! This seemed a little different than what I remember of my book and record set I wore out from overuse back in the 80s (my poor parents! It was Mary Poppins all day, every day!)! I think my copy was the Walt Disney version and based on the movie with Julie Andrews, which made Mary Poppins not quite so temperamental! It was still fun and enjoyable, and I hope to listen to more in the series.
