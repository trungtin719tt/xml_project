I read this book in about four hours. &amp; maybe that's as good an encapsulation for the experience as I can give.I like the eccentric, non-plot-driven memoir that sounds too strange to be true... and because it exists, because it ACTUALLY happened (unlike you, James Frey!), it merits thoughts about American families in addition to the ironies of self-obsessed psychologies.Written in cute concise prose, even if some jokes do not actually make you laugh but sicken you to the point of feeling truly bad for the preteen hero, the entire account is enormously entertaining, as is evident by the fast consumption of it.The movie is actually bad; despite Anette Bening, the creator of "Nip/Tuck" &amp; the film's director does not go to where this descriptively homosexual, deeply self-reliant misfit of a person goes.
