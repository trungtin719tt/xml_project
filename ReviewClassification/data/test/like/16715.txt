4 "Red Smoke" StarsWhere to begin....... I think this book reminds me of childbirth. All during labor you are cranky, not happy, feeling discombobulated and then you give birth and they place that baby in your arms and you forget how you felt before and all you feel is happiness!! The ending was so beautiful in my eyes that I forgot that this book did not wow me as much as I wanted it too.While this book was about Phury and Cormia, there was more BDB and Lessers stuff going on. I almost felt like I needed a chart to keep all the comings and goings straight. I did love getting more on the 3 amigos- John Matthews, Qhuinn, and Blay (as my lovely friend Christy calls them-which is a perfect name for them Christy), the Omega's surprise, Bella's pregnancy, more of Rehv's life as a symphath, the life of the Chosen, Phury and Z's relationship as twins, Lassiter the fallen angel and(view spoiler)[ Tohr(hide spoiler)], Cormia and her discovering of who she is, and finally the heartbreak of Phury's drug addiction and how it caused him to spiral out of control. Do you see what I mean about needing a chart!!! And in all of this was the love story of Cormia and Phury. Their story took awhile to develop with Phury's drug addiction but in the end, I was happy and the very, very end brought tears to my eyes....it was perfect, healing and very sentimental!!I am a lover of all BDB and while this book didn't get 5 stars from me, it still delivered because I became more entrenched in the BDB world and it gave me a wanting of reading the next book and knowing all that I can where the BDB is concerned.BR with Barb, Jxxx &amp; Pam
