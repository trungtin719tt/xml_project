Well, if you saw the Oscar-winning film, you pretty much got the gist.This is an examination of evil at its most primitive level, in which lawlessness, even in the modern world, reigns over conscience, reason &amp; morality. Chigurh is the prototypical Boogeyman: a walking, talking Michael Myers (c.a. 1978 by Carpenter) that is not immortal, though the concept of him will rule all the ages, prevailing like a force of nature. Powerful stuff, emotional &amp; heartless at the same time, &amp; of course, written in precise, minimalist prose.
