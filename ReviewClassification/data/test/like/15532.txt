Oh wow.Harris certainly didn't hold back with this one! (And I'm happy to say that the taint of the awful Aurora Teagarden series I read to tide me over until this book was released is finally gone!) I can confidently say this is probably in the Top Three books of the series. Here are a few random thoughts.- Eric continues to be a delight. I love him and Sookie together. And other than Sookie, I think Eric is the character that has developed the most over the course of the series.- Claudine! *sniffs*- Not enough Pam. Pam always brings an element of levity which is often needed in the series. She wasn't around much at all, and I missed her humor.- This book is way violent. Torture, murder, you name it. Eek!- I find it hard to believe that the Fae will disappear altogether. Dermot is still on the loose, so I suspect Harris will use that as a way to keep Niall and Co. around for another book ir so.And finally, Bill. *sigh* I liked Bill. Then he went all sullen and jerk-like and it was really, really hard to like him. I was okay with the triangle between Bill, Sookie and Eric, but that was mainly because I never thought that Harris really had any intention of Bill and Sookie getting back together! I'm not really a big fan of the"you must choose between them"scenario that Sookie seems to be headed for, because I think she already chose *not* to be with Bill anymore. I would really like to see Sookie and Eric try and make a real go at a relationship, because I think they could make it work.
