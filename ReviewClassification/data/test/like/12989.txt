Impressions after 2nd time re-readI honestly did not think any book would top the'Way of Kings'but I was mistaken!Words of Radiancerepresents the top echelon of epic fantasy, creative writing , worldbuilding and character development! I'm speechless and in complete awe of Sanderson's imagination and artistry. The second time re-reading/listening through audiobooks was so much better! It allows me to connect all the dots and all the subtleties hidden within the writing. It was almost like solving a hard puzzle where I was able to find all the small pieces and fully develop the story and all of its connections. Simply putWords of Radianceis a brilliant masterpiece and my favorite book of all times! My original review follows below...Full Review up..5 BIG Stars!" Where is our Honor? Honor is Dead."STORMFATHER!!!There are times in my life where a handful of books have meant so much more to me, because they transcended its core literary value- and went beyond imagery, fantasy and enraptured me fully into the world and the story of the narrator. I believe Sanderson and his brilliant 'Word of Radiance' have accomplished this rare feat!This book is aMASTERCLASSaccomplishment in fantasy, in the likes of Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' series, and more recently GRRM 'A Game of Thrones' books. There... I said it!I recognize I'm fairly late in joining the Stormlight saga, but after reading the brilliant 'The Way of Kings' couple months ago, I had set the bar so high for WoR, that it thrilled me to see this sophmore novel 'shatter' it's expectation ceiling!The narrative picks up almost immediately after the conclusion of Way of Kings. If the first Stormlight book was mostly focused on the life, struggle and ascension of Kaladin, this book spends the majority of its focus on Shallan-and how important she becomes to the whole story.Again, I'll emphatically say thatKALADIN IS MY FAVORITE FANTASY CHARACTER OF ALL TIMES!!Sanderson digs deep down, and develops a character that is gloom, bitter and full of rage- but deep in his core Kaladin is a pure soul, filled with 'Stormlight'. Kaladin is so multi-dimensional and layered that only by the end of the book you get appreciate the full AWESOMENESS of his character.His side-kick, the magic spren 'Syl' (a magic light in the likeness of a female) is a perfect counterbalance to his rage. As the story progresses, Syl not only becomes his truest of friends and confidants, but she integrates beautifully with Kaladin's powers in forging some of the most AMAZING action sequences that I've read in any fantasy book ever!!TheActionin Words of Radiance absolutely ROCKS! No spoilers, but there are at least 3 distinct action sequences in the book which are among the most compelling of any book ever written! There is not enough 'stormlight' to prepare you for the crescendo that Sanderson builds up in this wonderfully crafted world. What adds to the brilliance of the action, is how Sanderson integrates his visionary environment and the world of magic craft into each 'scene'.The story flows very naturally, and despite the book clocking at 1081 pages (kindle edition)- the entertainment value of Sanderson's world, and the richness of character development/world building, makes this a fast read.Sanderson plans on writing ten books in the Stormlight Archive, and already I feel overwhelmed at the grandiosity of his project. For us his readers and 'Sandersonites', we're blessed that he's a pretty prolific writer- who cranks a couple of books per year. ( Thank God he's not as slow as GRRM or Rothfuss)Sanderson mentioned in one interview, his first character ever created was 'Dalinar' (a highprince of large importance to the story) when he was a teenager. He has been thinking of the Stormlight series for most of his adult life. This gives me tremendous pause into thinking perhaps the Stormlight Archive will be one of the greatest achievements in fantasy when is finally completed!November 2017, and the third installment, 'Oathbringer', of this magical series can't come quick enough!10 Stormlight Stars:)
