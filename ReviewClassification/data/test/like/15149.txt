4.5Here we are 3 years after the release of Gone Girl- and every twisty turny page turning novel is STILL being compared. THE GIRL ON THE TRAIN is no exception...but that was not what caught my attention. What persuaded me??? Train...Witness to murder...Hitchcock...Rear Window. Those words will get me almost every time...Rachel is depressed, angry, and bitter. Gin and tonic- is her drink of choice- Wine comes in at a close second. Every day she takes the slow train from Asbury to Euston...and everyday it slows to a stop and she sees "Jason and Jess". The "perfect couple". A couple who just by watching them every day- gives her hope that happiness exists...Rachel is stuck clinging to the days she had with her ex-husband Tom- who left because of her drinking...who left her for a younger woman. A younger version of her- drama free...and a woman who now has Tom's baby. A baby that Rachel could never give him....The only relief from her dreary, pointless, life is "Jess and Jason"...(not their real names of course)...but very real for her all the same.Then one day Rachel witnesses something that doesn't seem right...something that involves a woman named Megan- the woman who she thought of as "Jess". And now Jess/Megan is missing...So far this is my favorite book from this year- YES, it has a lot of hype surrounding it- but don't let that get in the way of picking it up. :D
