Kala, brilliant. To say i love this book is an understatement. This book opened my eyes, my ears, my throat, my lungs, made me want to scream, dance and cry. Its a meditation on how to live a different kind of life, a life of spirit. Read the book, watch the movie, be inspired to live. Ahhhh!!!!Alexis Zorba: Damn it boss, I like you too much not to say it. You've got everything except one thing: madness! A man needs a little madness, or else...Basil: Or else?Alexis Zorba: ...he never dares cut the rope and be free.
