Edit: Re-read in May 2014, but leaving original review standing because it still expresses my feelings perfectly.Edit x2, January 2016: Having read some negative reviews, I'm thinking I might need to reread again and re-write this - not because I have doubts, but because I'm a little pissed off at the way people react to atraumatized teenby calling her whiny. I've had friends say it, I've seen reviews complaining about it, and it infuriates me. Come at me, bros; I'll fight you for Ruby Daly's honor.Owow ow owow ow ow ow owI don'tknow what to do with this bookand all of these feelings ow ow owObviously it's been too long since I last re-readBrightly Wovenbecause I remembered that Alexandra Bracken was a good writer but I seem to have forgotten HOW good until this book punched me in the gut.God.How do I talk about this?I don't even know. I finished it at about 8:30 last night and the ending basically rendered me nonfunctional for an hour. I vacuumed my room because I couldn't get my brain to cooperate on anything else.Let me count the ways in which this book was stupendous:1.An absolutely chilling dystopia. Plague diseases are basically my biggest fear, so that aspect had me freaked out from the very beginning, but what was even scarier were the camps. I've seen some reviews mentioning that they didn't think the U.S. government really would have locked kids with freaky powers up in internment camps, and to them I say: obviously you aren't familiar with the shit our government pulls on a regular basis. That isexactlywhat would happen, and that's what makes it scary.Honestly, this dystopia struck me as markedly closer to classics of dystopian literature - 1984, Brave New World, The Handmaid's Tale - than pretty much anything else I've read in this current faddish YA craze. Yes, even more so than The Hunger Games (though I'm sure fans will disagree with me). I've been trying to figure out why, and I think what it is is that the world of The Darkest Minds is incredibly harsh in a way a lot of YA authors seem to shy away from. LOTS of people die (again, something I've seen other reviewers complain about but stridently disagree with them about) and in incredibly brutal ways. There are multiple factions and every single one of them is dangerous and vicious. This world is horrifying and that is what makes itwork.2.Genuinely scary characters. This gets its own category because I CANNOT BELIEVE HOW TERRIFYING THESE KIDS WERE??? Friggin' Martin, holy shit. And the villain - not to spoil anything but AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH. Again, totally believable - bunch of kids who have been ripped from or thrown out of their homes and treated as less than animals for years and have these potentially horrifying powers - of course they're going to lash out at everything and anything. Of course they turn around and treat anyone who isn't them as worthless. These poor broken terrifying children were just... chilling.3.Relationships. GIRL FRIENDSHIPS AND SWEET SUPPORTIVE ROMANCE AND RUBY AND CHUBS BEING BUDDIES AND PEOPLE CALLING EACH OTHER ON THEIR SHIT AND WOW THE BLACK BETTY GANG IS EXCELLENT. I love them all, and I love the way they interact. They are a bastion of humanity in a world gone mad. And I honestly think one of my favorite moments was Chubs getting mad at Ruby for not fulfilling a promise, because real friends can and should bring that up and it made their relationship feel so real. I also loved how Ruby and Liam didn't just exist in this romantic bubble - they both had unique friendships and histories and they did things apart from each other and they were INDEPENDENT PEOPLE. (dear almost every other YA writer ever, are you taking notes?)4.Liam.can we have more love interests like this? Who are flawed, sweet, caring; who fall head over heels as much or more than the girls do, who make mistakes that have consequences and react to them realistically, WHO AREN'T CREEPY AS HELL, who do this: "Liam's only response was to move back a few paces. Giving me space."He's not perfect. He's not some hormone-triggering sex god. He's not dark and mysterious - he's just a well-meaning guy who is good for Ruby in every way and I enjoyed their relationship so much.5.The ending. Obviously I can't say much but ow ow ow ow ow ow. I assume this book will have a sequel and I will wait for it as patiently as possible.(view spoiler)[ also can we talk about what happened to Ruby's parents because OH MY GOD. I got to that bit about midnight and almost started crying and then had to quell the urge to go wake my parents up and hug them. The idea of the people who are closest to you not remembering you is so heartwrenching aaaaaagh. And even though I was pretty sure that's what had happened to them, reading the actual scene hurt so damn much.(hide spoiler)]A couple of quotes/aspects that stuck out to me under this spoiler cut; pages from the ARC:(view spoiler)["I would come in after training all day, and I'd look at it and think, how many of those people had families? and how many of those people had people who needed them like we needed Claire? And that's just it - they all did, Ruby, I'm sure of it. People don't live like islands." - Liam, p. 272'When a girl cries, few things are more worthless than a boy. Having two of them just meant that they stared at each other helplessly instead of at me.' - Ruby, p. 303 (side note: Ruby cries a lot, especially near the end, but considering what she's been through I think it's justified.)'Oh God, I couldn't even talk about it. I physically could not speak. Not about the hundreds of mind games I watched them play on the PSFs. Nothing about the memory of having to scrub the floors of the Mess Hall after an Orange told a PSF to walk in and open fire on every other soldier he saw there.' - Ruby, p. 309"Sorry about that." He smiled, extending a hand toward me. "Hey - I don't think we've had the chance to meet. I'm Liam." - P. 392 (I SWEAR MY HEART STOPPED HOLY SHIT NOT COOL LIAM NOT COOL)(hide spoiler)](not actually spoilery, really, but hidden anyway just to be sure.)I wish I could talk about the villain, because he was honestly one of the best aspects of the book - so subtle and scary, and even though I mistrusted him from before he appeared, there were times when I wondered if he was genuine.Anyhow, hopefully this scatterbrained and emotional review will convince you that you need to read this book, because you probably do. It's extraordinary.
