Ferdinand would rather sit under his favorite cork tree in Spain and smell flowers than roughhouse and butt heads like the other young bulls. But in a surprising twist of fate, Ferdinand is chosen to fight in the corrida, the bullfights in Madrid. What will the peaceful and care-free bull make of this change of scenery? Will he become a fighter for the cheering crowd in the ring?As far as I'm concerned bullfighting should become a "sport" of the past. Even in this charming book the drawings of the "long sharp pins with ribbons" and "long spears" used to provoke the bulls, remind me of the harm that is inflicted upon them. (Children, though, may not dwell on this because the writing and drawings are comical in tone).But this book will endure as a timeless classic because the illustrations by Robert Lawson capture not only the personality of free-spirited Ferdinand, but also the beauty of Spain - from its pastoral scenery to its narrow, urban passageways and tile roofs. Even bullfighting, viewed from a historical perspective, is interesting. This includes the matador in full regalia, in what is traditionally referred to as his "suit of lights," complete with the montera or hat. You also learn the proper Spanish names for the men, also bullfighters, who carry the pins and spears.The book's message is poignant today as well. Because of the proliferation of social media and mass media, the size of the cheering crowds has grown. Do we live our lives for our own enjoyment or do we spend our days chasing after applause? If we do that will we miss out on the simple pleasures of life, such as the scent of a flower? Ferdinand is comical because he could care less about what drives so many. Munro Leaf, the author, has created a protagonist who is so filled with sweet wonder for the beauty of the world, that he cannot be manipulated.He has been stubborn since 1936, when "The Story of Ferdinand" was originally published. It has been a favorite for generations of children. My Dad received the book as a gift when he was a boy. He remembered having a statue of Ferdinand on his dresser.I, however, have only come to read the book as an adult studying children's literature. It would have been nice to know about Ferdinand when I was a second grader playing AYSO soccer, more content to watch the clouds drift by than to score a goal. I would have found a kindred spirit.
