When i read this i was not on goodreads so a review now would not do justice, so this is up for a re-read. Matheson is such a good writer and this tale of one man's struggle to preserve the human race and find a way to stop the spread of the hungry beings is short but legendary. There has been quite a few adaptations but most have played with the story and changed some important parts the book is much better.I Am Legend has been adapted to a feature-length film three times (or four, if one includes the Direct to Video film I Am Omega, which does not credit Matheson as the source).http://more2read.com/?review=i-am-legend-by-richard-mathesonThere is a 7 part in depth video interview of Matheson he talks about writing and the movies.
