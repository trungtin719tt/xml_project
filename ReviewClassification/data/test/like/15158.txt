You know the worst thing about these books? They're like cotton candy. On face they look incredibly filling and satisfying but then you bite into them and the fluffy candy mass turns into so much sugar and you're just as hungry when you're finished as you were when you started. Except now you're out of money and your mom wants you to ride the Ferris wheel with your little sister.I've devoured all seven of the Sookie books and now I want more, except there aren't any more. Yet. No one should confuse these books for great literature, but they are sure as hell entertaining.
