Anita Blake is a vampire hunter/slayer among other dealings with the undead/occult and she's only in her early twenties. Story is told in a first person P.I. style which means there's some wry humor as well as a focus totally from the main character's POV.PROS(1) Fast read;(2) Vampires are similar to the legends but have enough unique differences where we are dealing with something new and enticing;(3) Anita is a nice mix of male and female which means she should appeal to both genders;(4) Well plotted; hardly any gap holes of logic; pacing is well done; and(5) Big finale climax at the end. Satisfying if you like things settled, well, violently. Heh.CONS(1) Her early books are great. I would warn that by book ten she starts to spend too much time in the lovemaking which slows everything down. Not an issue in this novel but will be later if you fall for the series as I did.CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B to B plus; ACTION SCENES: B plus; STORY/PLOTTING: B; SETTING/TONE: B plus to A minus; WHEN READ: 2006 (revised review mid November 2012); OVERALL GRADE: B plus.
