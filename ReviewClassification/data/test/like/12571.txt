My uncle called me from France because he'd heard third-hand that I was about to readJude the Obscureand he felt he needed to warn me away from it. I was going through a divorce; he felt that I was too fragile forJude.He was trying to save me, like warning your friend who just got out of traction against dirtbiking down the Matterhorn. This is the bleakest book from the bleakest author, a serious contender for Bleakest Book Ever Written, a book so dire that almost everyone hated it when it came out, not just hated it but were furious at Thomas Hardy for producing it; their response was so vitriolic that he never wrote a novel again.Hardy in order of bleaknessLess bleakReturn of the NativeFar From the Madding CrowdMayor of CasterbridgeTess of the D'UrbervillesJude the ObscureMost bleakI mean, it turns out that one of the messages of the book is that one shouldn't stay in a marriage that's not the right marriage, so from a certain perspective, what's the problem, right? One of the other messages is "But society will beat you down no matter what you do, and then everyone dies alone and miserable," so I guess there's that.Hardy was a free thinker, a realist and a radical. Like Dickens, he was concerned with the lives of the poor - rural poor, mostly, as opposed to Dickens' London poor. He was pro-women's rights. He was some weird homebrewed species of agnostic. Sue Bridehead is a fascinating, complicated character: skeptical, rebellious, self-destructive.(view spoiler)[(hide spoiler)]Hardy has this flair for vivid scenes. At one point two characters break up, and the whole thing is carried out via notes passed by schoolboys between classrooms. It's fantastic. He's melodramatic and overwrought and super entertaining, even at his most depressive, which, again, is right here in this book. It's either this orKing Learfor Bleakest Book Ever. I don't know what my uncle was so worried about, I thought it was great.
