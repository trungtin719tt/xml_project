Kellaaaaaaan.....Kellaaaaan....I know he'd choose me over Kiera. I know he would. It's true, don't make that face at me.S.C. Stephen's disturbs me. Should I be in love with her, or Kellan? What rock star did she study to write this character? Can I get a piece of him? Can I lick him?Creating a realistic character is not easy. So many books are filled with stiff dialogue and cardboard characters. Not in this book. The character's were flawed, annoying, sexy and real to damn life. With that said....Kellaaaaaan.....Kellaaaaan....Sorry, sorry. Okay, one more time....Kellaaaaaan!Good stories are supposed to torment you. They are supposed to make you frustrated. The entire time I was reading this, I felt like someone was stuffing me full of tapioca. I just kept feeling more and more sick with every page. (I cannot believe they did that with Denny in the next room!)I kind of want a piece of Griffin.Anyway, Kellan Kyle, if you're reading this; CALL ME!
