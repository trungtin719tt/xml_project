This early courtroom thriller from John Grisham mainly moves at a sedate pace, but is still an engrossing read. The plot centres round a civil suit brought against a large tobacco company in Biloxi, Mississippi. Those charged with defending the tobacco company baulk at nothing to secure the verdict they want. Bribery and intimidation appear to be the order of the day for some unfortunate jurors. However, mysterious couple Nicholas and Marlee are also pulling strings to achieve the verdict they are after. It isn't until the final faster chapters that we get to see who wins.
