No, seriously this organ in my chest, I don't need it. That's not a spoiler, that's a warning. This book is such a riveting installment, but be warned that it will not pull at your heart strings, rather it will pluck them until they break.Okay, I love June. She's a fantastic heroine. A little too young, but I get Lu's reasons for making her 15.The reason I gave this four instead of five stars, well there's a couple. The first is I didn't love Day as much in this book, and I really needed to. He was seriously irritating at times, but real people are. There's a storyline with Tess and it made me so freaking mad. Here's the thing(view spoiler)[Love triangles are great as long as they involve two boys and a girl. NOT two girls and boy. Come on.(hide spoiler)]I also didn't love all the dreams June and Day kept having. I think they are cheap devices in literature and yes that's coming from someone who coined the term "Dream Travel." It's just dream travel is real and what happens in dreams isn't and so it feels like they don't really move the plot along. They just dump info. And one final nitpick, at one point Day is put under for surgery. In most cases people cannot have dreams when they are under anesthesia. That one is a small one, but I had to note it.The second book is really great! Gripping and fun. The ending to me was a little wrong. I get why it happened that way. And yes, I immediately went out and got third book, but it was definitely a crafty device for ending the book. Honestly, I'm torn on what I want to happen to the characters. Very good book, which delivers a lot of exhilarating emotions.Oh and one final note, bathroom scene. Nice one! :)
