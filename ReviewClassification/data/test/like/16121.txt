4.5""And he has these gross little monkey hands."Right now, getting killed would be a breath of spring."That's supposed to mean he has a little wiener dick."If Fertility keeps talking, my caseworker will have one less client in the morning."And he's not obese," Fertility says, "he's not a whale, but he's too fat for me."In case there's a sniper outside, I open the blinds and stand my gross obese body in the window. Please, anybody with a rifle and a scope. Shoot me right here. Right in my big fat heart. Right in my little Wiener."Oh Chuck. what the f...? I love it. I can get a great discussion on comedy and tragedy from Dante if I want, but in this 21st century I think I prefer Palahniuk's version. Chuck doesn't deliver thoughts, emotions, real life experiences with kid gloves. No, he throws them right in your face like a big cream pie.If I wanted a discussion on the negative liabilities of religion and ensuing corporate greed I could browse some Dawkins. But again... I very much enjoy Chuck's version.A satirical punch in the gut look at cults and the flock of sheep that follow modern days greener grass.This is my 5th Palahniuk novel and I am starting to think I would like to read all his novels.
