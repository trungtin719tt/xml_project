This was my first taste of Richard Russo's wonderful prose and lifelike characters. The book follows the lives of Miles Roby and his family in the dying industrial town of Empire Falls, Maine. The town itself is beautifully described throughout as the book transpires over a school year - Miles' daughter Tick's senior year at Empire High. I really loved how Russo writes dialog (both exterior and interior) and his sense of humor and irony. Most of the time, I felt like I was sitting in the Empire Grill listening to Walt doing his Perry Como impersonations while Horace was beating him in gin, Max was trying to steal money from the till, David was slinging burgers with his one good hand, Tick was ringing the bell over the door as she came in slumped over by her heavy backpack. The way that Russo uses "beats" in dialogs greatly added to the realism. I also found the two antagonists, Francine Whiting and Jimmy Minty, to be great foils to Miles. The bool weaves wonderful parallels between the past and present and is rich in analogies. The central message is one of taking responsibility for one's fate rather than blaming circumstances for one's shortcomings. Both the Prologue and Epilogue are wonderful bookends to the main story.I can definitely see how he earned his Pulitzer in 2002 for this fantastic book. I have subsequently read Nobody's Fool and Everybody's Fool and loved and reviewed both here on GR.
