Juliette and Adam are still hanging out in the underground facility working on the resistance. Juliette tries to learn to control her power while Adam undergoes testing to figure out why he can touch Juliette. Answers are not good and the two have some problems to work through. This was very frustrating. I understood Juliette's reasoning but I really hate the back and forth. Plus Adam just breaks my heart. He is so sweet and wants to make things work with Juliette. But they are also dealing with an unruly hostage who will only speak to Juliette.Oh Warner. How psycho I truly thought you were. Oh how hard I tried to hate you, to stay on Team Adam. But I really can't resist you any longer! We get down deep with Warner and what you find out is that he is not psycho, his father is! Supreme Commander Anderson laughs that Warner has feelings, laughs that Warner tried to kill him as a boy but couldn't, laughs at how weak Warner is for wanting to be near his mother. Warner took his mom's last name. Awww! I love me a mammas boy! Not to mention how eloquently, and swoontasticly Warner speaks to Juliette.Kenji is such a hilarious scene stealer! I am Team Kenji along with everyone else but don't worry he is so not a love interest. Just a fun and understanding friend with great comic relief. I once again just LOVE the super descriptive writing style. It does take a few pages to get back into the swing of it but it makes me feel like I am Juliette. I feel completely inside her head and I see and feel everything as her perfectly. I feel her frustrations, her bravery, and her courage. I love how strong she is becoming. It ends similar to the first book, no huge cliffhanger, but it just kind of ends with you still needing and wanting more!5 Stars just for Warner's very swoon worthy performanceAdam Warner Adam Warner Adam WarnerWhat do I do?!?!?!After Chapter 62 (*fans self*) I think Warner..."Youdestroyme.""Juliette," he says and he mouths the name, barely speaking at all, and he's pouring molten lava into my limbs and I never even knew I could melt straight to death."I want you," he says. He says "I want all of you. I want you inside and out and catching your breath and aching for me like I ache for you." He says it like it's a lit cigarette lodged in his throat, like he wants to dip me in warm honey and he says "It's never been a secret. I've never tried to hide that from you. I've never pretended I wanted anything less.""You-you said you wanted f-friendship-""Yes," he says, he swallows, "I did. I do. I do want to be your friend. He nods and I register the slight movement in the air between us. "I want to be the friend you fall hopelessly in love with. The one you take into your arms and into your bed and into the private world you keep trapped in your head. I want to be that kind of friend," he says. "The one who will memorize the things you say as well as the shape of your lips when you say them. I want to know every curve, every freckle, every shiver of your body, Juliette-""No," I gasp. "Don't-don't s-say that-""I want to know where to touch you," he says. "I want to know how to touch you. I want to know how to convince you to design a smile just for me." I feel his chest rising, falling, up and down and up and down and "Yes," he says. "I do want to be your friend." He says "I want to be your best friend in the entire world.""I want so many things," he whispers. "I want your mind. Your strength. I want to be worth your time." His fingers graze the hem of my top and he says "I want this up." He tugs on the waist of my pants and says "I want these down." He touches the tips of his fingers to the sides of my body and says, "I want to feel your skin on fire. I want to feel your heart racing next to mine and I want to know it's racing because of me, because you want me. Because you never," he says, he breathes, "never want me to stop. I want every second. Every inch of you. I want all of it."And I drop dead, all over the floor."Juliette."I can't understand why I can still hear him speaking because I'm dead, I'm already dead, I've died over and over and over again.He swallows, hard, his chest heaving, his words a breathless, shaky whisper when he says "I'm so-I'm so desperately in love with you-""He actuallybegged menot to kill you." Laughs again. "It was just as pathetic as it was surprising.""Of course then I knew I had to meet you," he says, smiling, staring at me like he might be enchanted. "Imust meet the girl who's managed to bewitch my boy!I said to myself. This girl who's managed to make him lose sight of his pride-hisdignity-long enough to beg me for a favor," A pause. "Do you know," he says to me, "when my son has ever asked me for a favor?" He cocks his head. Waits for me to answer.I shake my head."Never." He takes a breath. "Never, not once in nineteen years has he ever asked me for anything. Hard to believe, isn't it?""Yeah, bro." Kenji puts his utensils down. "You aremoody. It's always 'Shut up, Kenji.' 'Go to sleep, Kenji.' 'No one want to see you naked, Kenji.' When I know for a fact that there are thousands of people who would love to see me naked-"
