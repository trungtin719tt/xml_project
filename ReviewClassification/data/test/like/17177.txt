This is a welcome Virago reissue of a 60s classic with a witty and irreverent introduction by Julie Burchill.Starting in 1945 this follows the careers, love lives and addictions of three girls in New York: a genius singing/dancing star, a beauty with no talent other than her amazing face and body, and the cool ice-queen who becomes the 'face' of TV cosmetic advertising.The characters are kind of cliched yet Susann makes them compelling, everyday and alien all at the same time; and the drama of their lives never stops. Written in 1966 (or at least published then) this depicts a world where even hugely rich and successful women just want to find a man to love and have his babies, while the men manage to have it all...Beneath all the glitz and drama though is a huge anger at the fates doled out to women, and this gives the book a surprising depth. Glamorous, addictive and really quite wise as well, this is a fabulous read.
