5 Words: Beauty, freedom, pressure, popularity, friendship.One day it was sunny outside, and a girl wanted to read a book. She was already currently reading SEVEN BOOKS but, decided that as great as they were she didn't want them. She wanted some nostalgia for a better/worse time when she was in high school. And this was one of those books she had read all those years ago and it was still on her shelf. She remembered that it was pretty awesome. In fact, it was so awesome that despite reading it ten years ago, and reading almost 200 books every year since, she could remember everything.So she plucked Pretties off of her shelf and sat on a lounger in the middle of the garden on that sunny day, and only put it down once to make a strong black coffee. She read until she had finished the book and her shoulders were a bright, burning red, because she got lost in the messed up world in the book and forgot to reapply the factor 50 to her pale, British skin and her shoulders always burn. She knows this and she could feel it happening but PRETTIES.So yeah, I picked this up yesterday, read it in two long sittings with only a break to make coffee in the middle, and I loved it just as much as I did when I first read it ten years ago. God I'm old.I love the characters, the world, the story. I love the conflicts, the pain, the love, the hate. This book has everything and I love it.In terms of the series, READ THEM ALL. IN ORDER. The books themselves are amazing, but the series read in order is INCREDIBLE. This book picks up a little while after the first one, but there's no major gap or confusion.
