Wow.Mac wasreallyfucking annoying during the first half of this book. I can see why someone might DNF this thing. Really.When I originally read this in 2009, I hadn't read thousands of books with aparanormaltwist, and the market wasn't overflowing with books about evil fairies, so this was a new sort of book for me.And I loved it.However, if this was my first time reading itnow, I might have tossed it out the window after Mac gave her explanation for substitute swear words.Ass = Petunia &amp; Fuck = Frog?Are you kidding me with that southern belle bullshit?Fortunately, I already knew that this version of Mac was going to be replaced by a better, stronger, cooler, and far less strangle-worthy version.Mac:Mac 2.0:Second time around I now have an appreciation for some of folks who maybe didn't love this book, butmyfeelings on it didn't change.None of my favorite urban fantasy series had a 1st book that blew me out of the water. Some of them, like Kate Daniels, I didn't like enough to even go back and attempt the second book foryears.So, it doesn't bother me that Darkfever has a few glitches, because it also has Jericho Barrons.I have many Book Boyfriends, but Barrons is...Barrons.I can't even explain much I love him.LOVE him.Do notget on my thread and tell me you don't understand why.Seriously. Iwilldefriend you over this.
