So I liked this book, but I also disliked this book. I think this is the most confused I've been about a book ever.I really enjoyed being in the Sookie-verse again, and I always enjoy Harris' writing style. I got to see all my old favorites and meet some new people. Sookie is getting a backbone, which is good, and during her whole talk with Quinn, I was screaming "You go girl!" because face it everyone wants to be someone's only one. I mean he should have called her after leaving the hospital to say "Hey, my mom's gone crazy so I got to go save her. I'll be in touch. Love you. Smooches." That's all he had to say to her, but did he? No. Stupid boy.But the reason I didn't like this book is that there is no central plot other than Sookie figuring out that life is complicated and people are complicated. Nobody fits in a perfect "best friend" box or a perfect "boyfriend material" box. Also, is it me or does she have way too many guys sniffing up her skirt? I mean seriously that does not happen in real life. Especially them all being major hotties.But yeah, (sigh) Eric getting his memory back. Me = big Eric fan. But also I am a big Sam fan. She just needs to push everyone away and give Sam a chance or she'll be mad at herself later. And all this "Sam would be happy with her because they can run under the moon together" bullshit needs to stop. If that was a big deal to him, he would not be slyly courting her as he is.I really like how her family situation is morphing. She's making her own family with the witches and Hunter (and Hunter's dad) and her new Grandpa and at the same time seeing that family ties you grew up with are not always healthy (ie breaking things off with Jason but realizing that she will have to talk to him eventually).So I liked the book; it is definitely setting up for some more good times in the Sookie-verse. But instead of sating me on Sookie for a while, it's just increased my angst for the next book. (Sneaky trick!)
