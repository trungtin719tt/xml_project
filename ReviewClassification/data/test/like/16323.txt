I haven't read any of his works before, a friend told me that "Eleven Minutes" is very good, a story of finding true love and where sex should play part in the search for it but without a sense of vulgarism in the plot. Other friend told me that it is Paulo Coelho at his best. So I decided to borrow the book from the bookshop where I work and read it all the way till the last page. And I have to say both of my friend is right, this book is so good to read. It talks more than just finding true love and sex, for me it's more about searching and understanding yourself where at the end you'll find true compatible feeling in loving someone.So many quotable lines, if the book is mine I'm sure I've mark most of the pages. I think I need to buy one and put it in my bookshelf. One day, I'll make "that someone" read this book, this book is a must read book for any couple who want to understand each other better.
