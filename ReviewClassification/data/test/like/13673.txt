I cannot believe how much I loved this book. I ended up reading it in one sitting because I was so engulfed in the plot. There are so many questions I have that need to be answered so I quickly put the other two books of the trilogy on hold at my library. I ended up ordering pizza from Dominos because I did not want to put the book down to cook. lol
