I just did a re-read to prep myself forGolden Son.*squeals*For me, it was definitely the right choice.I would have missed a lot of references...mainly, because my tiny dinosaur brain can't hold onto/recall information like it used to.So.Was it still as good as I remembered?Original 2013 review:This review can also be seen atAddicted2Heroines.There's a lot of hype surrounding this book, and for once it's totally deserved.How often can you really say that?!When I first started reading it, I was pretty convinced that it was going to be a fairly average book.Maybe.Hopefully.I mean, I've read a lot of dystopians and a lot of sci-fi lately. Was thisreallygoing to be that different?And after the first chapter, I was less than impressed.It's set underground. On Mars.Great.And everyone is color-coded.AWESOME. Haven't seen that at least 200 times before...Oh. And the main character is already married? AT SEVENTEEN!?Guh.He's some sort of super-skilled digger?What? Is he part mole-man?Are they DANCING as a form of rebellion?What the fuck kind of stupid shit is this?!Yeah. I was not impressed.Ah, but I was soveryverywrong.After that initial chapter introducing you to Darrow and his life, this book starts to get really interesting...really fast.Darrow's wife is not content with their life, even though she is very much in love with him. She wants to fight against the Golds that she feels are enslaving her people. Darrow, on the other hand, is not willing to risk their safety (hers in particular) for a dream he doesn't believe in. He may not think that their life is fair, but he believes that he is doing the right thing for future generations by helping to terraform the planet. She, however, sees the potential Darrow has to save the Reds, even when he doesn't see it himself.And she does something unthinkable to help him realize that potential.What she does sets Darrow on an incredible journey to the surface, and into the heart of the enemy. To help realize her dream, he eventually agrees to join the Red's rebellion. He also agrees to allow them to transform him into one of the elite Golds. It's no easy task, since it requires genetic modification, surgery, and lessons in speech and etiquette. After all of this, he must not only gain entrance to their training academy, but come out of it at the head of the class.Unfortunately, not much is known about what happens to the young Golds who enter the academy, only that it produces the future leaders of their society. The rebels have enough resources to forge his documents, but once inside, Darrow will be on his own.When he enters the academy, he feels nothing but revulsion for these obnoxious children. They are lazy, greedy, pampered, and shallow. He has already seen first hand the extent of the Gold's evil deceptions, andnothingwill stand in the way of him bringing them down. His hatred of these elitist teenagers burns white-hot in his chest, and it doesn't matterwhathe has to do in order to emerge victorious...Except.Oh shit.Not many things are truly black and white...are they?M'kay. Lots of comparisons to The Hunger Games floating around out there.In my opinion, Red Rising takes The Hunger Games and spanks its overrated ass.Don't get me wrong, I liked Suzanne Collin's trilogy, and (obviously) so did a lot of other people.But I never quitelovedit.Mainly, because Katniss always seemed to be an unwilling participant in the story. She was pushed, pulled, and prodded into everything that she did. And in the end, I felt disappointed that her character never seemed to grow past that. She did what shehadto do...and shesurvived.The End.I wanted to see some sort of spark of life in her, but it seemed (to me) like she was just a depressed puddle of skin, who would occasionally snap out of it and do something extraordinary.Darrow, on the other hand, grew and changed throughout the entire book. He started out as a Katniss-like character, but ended up a different person entirely. His motivations changed, his beliefs changed, and even his view of the world changed. He stopped being a bystander in his life, and the result was spectacular.I gotta say, the writing in this is nothing short of amazing. It's just...I can't adequately describe how much Brown made me feel for these characters. Really, I was blown away.Especially surprising since this was a debut novel.If you only read one book this year, it needs to be this one.Seriously.I received this digital arc from NetGalley in exchange for an honest review.
