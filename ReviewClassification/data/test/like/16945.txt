5 Stars!!!!!Despite being thrillers not my preferred genre, this is the second book that features murder and mayhem and a killer that I have read in past couple of days. An surprisingly, I am not at all missing the 'love' and obviously the 'sex' between the fictional characters.This could be mostly due to the fact that GF has an amazing, AMAZING talent for writing stories. It is extremely rare to find a book where you have great writing, fantastic characters and incredible story line. This book or rather the two books that I have read by this author have all the three. I never really say this, but Gillian Flynn has become my go to authors now. No matter what she writes next I am buying it and that too, in hardcover.Unlike the Sharp Objects, this story is told in multiple POVs and we see a constant but seamless back and forth between past and present. Libby is drifting through life after the brutal murders of her mother and two older sisters back when she was only seven. Because of her testimony and several other factors, Ben is in prison. Over the years, Libby's case has garnered much attention and she has even published a book about the murders. She has been relying upon people's donations to get her through life because really she is too lazy to work. Oh and she loves to snitch things, here and there.So when a group of people contact her about the murders and to free Ben, she is reluctant at first. Of course, she wouldn't help people who think Ben is innocent and she is the devil who put that amazing man away. But when they agree to pay her to help them solve this already solved murder, she jumps on the chance. Yes, she isn't exactly a very likable character but I loved this woman to pieces. Something about her wit and her flaws were very endearing.Now we have to figure out--- is Ben innocent and if he is, who killed their family and if someone else killed their family, why didn't Ben contest his sentence all those years ago and what exactly did Libby see on that night.With so many questions to figure out, I definitely had many theories. So by the end of it I kind of did know what was going to be the end but that did NOT spoil my fun. I still finished this in one day and I still was scared to sleep alone after finishing this.Again, I would say if you are a fan of dark and twisted then this book is the gem you have been looking for. Read this. And soon. It's sooo good! &lt;3
