I am always cautious when picking up a book in which animals figure prominently in the story. I am a HUGE animal lover and I have found that the treatment of animals in stories can be very disturbing and heart breaking to me. Nevertheless, the premise of this story sounded fascinating and I wasn't disappointed.On a cold December day, Grace Graves goes riding on her horse Pilgrim with a friend. There is a terrible accident... Grace's friend and her horse are killed... and Grace and Pilgrim are horribly injured... both physically and emotionally. Grace loses a leg in the accident and although Pilgrim's physical injuries will eventually heal; emotionally, the two.... girl and her beloved horse... are wounded spirits in need of healing. Grace's mother, Annie Graves, becomes aware of a man in Montana.. Tom Booker... who has the reputation of being 'gifted'... he has a voice that can soothe and heal the broken spirits of the horses he comes into contact with. Annie is desperate to make her daughter whole again and she recognizes the connection between her daughter's health and Pilgrim's health; so Annie, Grace and Pilgrim set out on a journey to Montana and it is there that their lives are changed forever.This beautiful story is about the complexities of relationships... between mothers and daughters and even between human beings and animals. The story is a moving one about love, acceptance and trust.. the necessary ingredients of ALL relationships. Although the ending was not what I had hoped for, I highly recommend this book for anyone who has a 'sweet spot' for animals.. especially horses and anyone who has the ability to marvel at the resilience of the spirit.. whether human or animal.
