After the last book, I am so excited for this one. Stark and Zoey are definately going to end up together. No doubt about it. But Stevie Rae and Rephaim. I want Rephaim to turn into that boy he was in Aphrodite's vision. Stevie Rae deserves to be with the one she loves! Ugh. Neferet and Kalona. No one likes them, but even after everything that's happend, I can't help but feel bad for Kalona. He's stuck with Neferet forever. Could his punishment get any worse?
