It's a thankless job, telling people it's a hard, hard Universe they're in!But somebody's got to do it, and that's the job Kurt Vonnegut embarks on here, through the voice of his character Winston Niles Rumford, an impromptu deux-et-machina who plays with humanity like a fickle overlord with his toy soldiers, hoping to lure us, push us, force us, enchant us, frighten us into growing up, into freeing our minds of the shackles of political games, money grubbing, religious intransigence or epicurean abandon.You see, Winston Niles Rumsfoord is a special person. He went out exploring the Solar System in his private spaceship even after earlier probes revealed the dangers of the endeavour. Subsequently he became chrono-synclastic-infundibulated (don't worry, the concept is explained in the novel) meaning he and his dog became scattered both in space and in time, witnessing the past and the future of the Earth. He now regularly re-materializes as a Prophet / agent of social change, determined to bring humanity into a new Illuminated Age.Any man who would change the World in a significant way must have showmanship, a genial willingness to shed other people's blood, and a plausible new religion to introduce during the brief period of repentance and horror that usually follows bloodshed.The plot of the novel pretty much follows the above Rumsfoord script, but within these boundaries Vonnegut excells as usual in his particular brand of black humor, impassionate condemnations of the military mindset, sharp satire of religious fundamentalism (check out the new concept of handicapping the lucky ones in order to cancel out their born advantages). What is particular to this early novel is a youthful enthusiasm, a more optimistic vibe, an exuberance and a rush of new ideas that would be tempered in later Vonnegut novels by a darker mood, dissillusionment and bleakness at humanity's chances to pull itself out of its present funk.Coming back to the plot of the novel, it may be the influence of reading Dante in parallel, but I detected some pretty obvious references to the Divine Commedia. Rumsfoord picks as his agents of change his former wife Beatrice and a billionare Hollywood playboy named Malachi Constant. Beatrice plays a more passive role until the end of the novel ('The excesses of Beatrice were excesses of reluctance'.) I see her main role in the economy of the story as a cautionary tale against being too afraid to live your life, to take chances and to risk getting your heart broken in the process.(view spoiler)[ the conclusion of her story arc is one of those wonderful Vonnegut aphorisms, so quotable:The worst thing that could possibly happen to anybody would be to not be used for anything by anybody.(hide spoiler)]Malachi Constant I interpret as the man who loses his way in a dark wood and descends to Hell before he can ascend to Purgatory (there to meet the sirens of Titan from the title and to decipher at last the meaning of life). Another analogy could be made to biblical Job, as he is uprooted from his luxurious life and isolated from all his fellow humans by the machinations of Rumsfoord. I'm not starting a synopsis of his misadventures, because they form the backbone of the plot and I want to leave the pleasure of discovery for new readers intact. Again, Vonnegut draws the conclusion with his usual black humour:Oh, my! said Constant, life is funny when you stop to think about it.The novel is relatively short, but the rush of new concepts and the inventiveness make it feel like three or four normal novels condensed into one volume. One character in particular I felt deserved his own separate story. I'm referring to Salo the Tralfamadorian, the alien with inflatable feet whose defective flying saucer left him stranded in our Solar System until he could get a spare part from 150000 light years away. Extraterrestrial lifeforms in SF serve as mirrors to reflect and define our human nature when looked from outside our narrow, pebble in the sky perspective. Salo is no exception, and his millenia long monitoring of our planet has in the end changed his neutral, detached status:The machine is no longer a machine. The machine's contacts are corroded, the bearings fouled, his circuits shorted, and his gears stripped. His mind buzzes and pops like the mind of an Earthling - fizzes and overheats with thoughts of love, honor, dignity, rights, accomplishments, integrity, independence.The last batch of bookmarks I have are all related to the new religion created by Winston Niles Rumsfoord ( The Church of God the Utterly Indifferent), part satire, part serious teachings from the pen of one of my favorite humanist crusaders. I believe they are self-explanatory:Take Care of the People, and God Almighty Will Take Care of Himself!Oh, Mankind, rejoice in the apathy of our Creator, for it makes us free and truthful and dignified at last. No longer can a fool point to a ridiculous accident of good luck and say 'Somebody up there likes me'. And no longer can a tyrant say, 'God wants this or that to happen, and anybody who doesn't help this or that to happen is against God'.The sermon of the panorama was that even a man without a friend in the Universe could still find his home planet mysteriously, heart-breakingly beautiful.Not to be lonely, not to be sad - xxx had decided that those were the most important things in life.You might wonder why, after all the praise, I still didn't rate the book five stars. While I consider it a classic and one of the best Vonnegut efforts, I did had some issues with the plot development, especially the chapters centered on the Mars military force. I also thought the concepts taken individually are all great but they don't always mesh together optimally, making the ideas more important than character development or motivation. I put it down to an aboundance of inspiration that felt the need to throw in everything at once into the mix. Maybe a re-read will add the last star.
