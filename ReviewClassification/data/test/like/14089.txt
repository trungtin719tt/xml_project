I get it! IFINALLYget it!Everyone's been admonishing me for not having read this book."Read it!" They told me. "You'll love it!"Well, you were all right! I did enjoy this book. Very much.It's sad and melancholy, yet sweet and uplifting.The characterization is really beautiful ... I liked that every single character was flawed in some way. Incredibly realistic. And not at all forced. Everything about them felt natural and realistic. And, even though it's been a (long) while since I was 18, I felt like I could easily connect and remember what it was like being that age.The voice acting in this audiobook was phenomenal. I never once questioned the validity of their emotions or actions. Pacing was a bit slow in some spots ... but it all worked in the grand scheme of the story.So now, like all of my friends who recommended this to me ... if you haven't experienced this wonderful book yet, I would definitely recommend it to you!
