What a work it was.!! The copy I have is by Penguin Little Black Classics series,and I was delaying reading it since the print was tiny and set in a style I didn't like. But now I realize what a stupid I was to have delayed reading such a piece of beauty...Moralizing isn't everyone's forte. Too many have written such a lot of works on the topic that the moment one starts reading something on it,the natural reaction is 'not again.!' This book is a bit different in that genre. It moralizes,it talks of morals of men and God.. It goes on to lengthy arguments,though not much in terms of rationality,on many occasions.. Antigone and Creone and Haemon and Tiresias puts up their own arguments. But nowhere do feel a sense of boredom. Sophocles has given strength to each character,no matter which part he argues. Each one of them talks as if there is fire in their words,a fire that can't be quenched by the other person's arguments.'It's a dreadful thing to yield..But resist now?Lay my pride bare to the blows of ruin?That's dreadful too.'The fear described in these words,the fear of knowing the right but refusing to go back on one's actions because of pride,it's a folly we all are guilty of. Pride is a sin,but it is the most humane of feelings. It is impossible not to feel it,if for nothing then for one's lack of it. We all hold on to our words and actions like its a part of us. We would rather die than take back our words. We say-a man is only as good as his words. And this King is no less human in that... But see where that pride takes him..In the beginning,Creon tells Ismene,'Don't even mention her-she no longer exists.'And in the end,he tells his attendants,'I don't even exist-I'm no one. Nothing.'But we don't have to be bothered of all these,do we.? Pride is something we can't avoid.. I'm proud of my books and so are you of other things.. But let aside moralizing.. The book is a masterpiece...When injustice is the law..I might sound stupid for bringing Che into such a regal and archaic setting,but I guess I'm not. The dilemma portrayed here,the choice between the law of the land and the moral laws one hold within,is something that every human faces. To bend or to resist is the question. And Antigone makes her choice courageously. She refuses to submit to the law of the land which she calls injustice,and decides to court death for a law she holds to heart,the law of God. The classic dilemma between law of customs and law of intuition. But it would be somewhat gray to call it law of intuition since there is no pure law of intuition,all our ideas are colored by our genes and circumstances. Antigone's act of defiance is inspiring. And that is what makes this work so fiery.A read that was thoroughly entertaining.
