I picked up this book because I'd seen the movie preview and thought that I should really read it before watching it. Problem is, I have a real love/hate relationship with Nicholas Sparks. I'm a happy ending kind of a girl. I read books to escape the sadness, drama and sometimes craziness of life. I swear, every other time I read a Sparks book I swear I'll never read another. I don't like it when people find true love and then one of them dies or does something stupid so they're ripped apart forever (Dear John anyone?. How much did that blow?!!) Plus, that's not even that realistic because I know very few people that has happened to. Anyway, on with the review. . .SPOILER ALERT: I did a little research and determined that this one might be a safe one to try. I held my breath through a good portion of the book, but in the end, I was pleasantly surprised. I wasn't thrilled with the ending, but at least it wasn't sad.As I was reading reviews I saw a lot of people complaining that this book was very stereotypical. Pretty, perfect people, a villian you love to hate. Well, that's probably true, but those are the books Sparks writes and most people like him for that. Like I said, some like to escape the reality of life a little.Overall, the book was a lot of fun. I had a hard time putting it down. I loved the love story of it. One of Nicholas Spark's better stories.
