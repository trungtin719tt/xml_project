I have a lot of feelings about this book and about Scott and Zelda's relationship, which was the basis of this story.First of all, I think his writing is a mess. It's often in need of a good edit and here is no different. The chapters were shuffled around, looking for an order to make it work and finally settled with flashbacks, rather than a linear order. While I think that was the right decision, you can see that chapters could be chopped and changed and often read independently of one another. Perhaps this is a consequence of writing short stories and always having good snippets of a story, but never quite knowing how to link them all together.Of the essence of the novel, it's pure Scott and Zelda. So much so, that he reportedly stole sections of her own novel for this book, instead of passing it straight to the publishers, while she was being treated for manic depression. She often accused him of stealing ideas from her diaries throughout their marriage and true or not, he obviously used aspects of their life together. In Tender is the Night, we encounter heavy drinking, numerous affairs, furious rows and episodes of mental illness, all of which are well documented parts of their life. It's painfully intrusive, as we watch two broken people start to crack and for the first time, instead of turning to one another, they begin to drift apart.I think it's his best book, in all of it's rawness. Gatsby is a well constructed masterpiece, but this is the reality that came out of the other side.
