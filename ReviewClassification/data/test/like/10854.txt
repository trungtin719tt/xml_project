This was a lovely book to read. It was a hearty book, full of little surprises that keep the suspense going. It reminds me of an old X-Files episode called Monday. "Monday" was inspired by an episode of The Twilight Zone entitled "Shadow Play" (1961).The plot is that of Sam, who is a bully and teases Juliet mercilessly. Juliet commits suicide by jumping in front of Sam's friend's car. After that there is a Groundhog Day-like scenario.I won't spoil the ending, but this YA book shows consistency of quality throughout it's entire readership. It's full of pathos, feeling, mercurial drama, deja vu, and melancholy.
