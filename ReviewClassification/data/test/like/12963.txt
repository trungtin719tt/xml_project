One of the joys of being a parent is sharing old favorites with my children. Harriet and Sean are now discovering Dr. Seuss. We are reading through all of his books and have landed on my all time favorite: One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish. From the time I was Harriet's age to being in second or third grade, I read this book on an almost daily basis. I really don't know how many times I've read it (either listening to it being read by one of my parents or reading it myself).One Fish, Two Fish... begins with this little dedication: "From there to here, from here to there, funny things are everywhere." This book revels in the silly. It starts off simply enough with fish of different color and fish of different ages. Then it spirals out of control with fish driving cars and even sillier things.The book doesn't have a plot. It's a series of tongue twisters presented as short scenes, almost like vaudeville routines. Witnessing these different examples of silly are a boy and a girl (or a Sean and a Harriet as my children see things). They watch creatures run (just for fun), different animals with different feet (and numbers of legs), and they go on a ride with Mr. Gump's Wump. There is Ned and his bed with holes in the most annoying of places. I wonder if he'll ever get a descent night's sleep? There are animals for opening cans, and others for boxing, ones who have hair for brushing and so forth.In all of this silliness are Dr. Seuss's illustrations. All of the creatures have Seuss's unique style, being somewhat shaggy (even the fish). I can remember sometimes just flipping through the book to enjoy the drawings. My favorites are the pink ink drinking yink, can opening zans, the sleep walking sheep and the hook cook book.
