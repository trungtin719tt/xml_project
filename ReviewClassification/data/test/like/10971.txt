Ahh... much much better, Chris.Christopher Paolini has always been someone of inspiration. Writing and publishing a book at the age of 15, and a damn good book at that, is immensly impressive. Then he followed it with Eldest, which I thought was an improvement on his first. His writing style and language had drastically improved and I loved reading about Eragon's training in Ellesmera, as well as Roran's story of bravery and loss. The whole 2nd book raced along, leading to a superb climax when Eragon learned a terrible truth about his heritage.Then, as if the the wheels suddenly fell off and the race was cut short, Brisingr arrived, in the fall of 2008. Here, the series started to suffer. The book was an overly long mess, full of filler to the extent that the plot advanced a centimeter every hundred pages. Many of the chapters laboured by, and by the end of the book, in which a hastily written ending was slashed together, I was left feeling very deflated. If only Paolini had kept the series a trillogy, I thought in despair.Then, news of the final book started to filter out into the never ending web that is the world of the internet. It was to be the last one, the end. Hopes where high. Paolini would no longer be hampered by extending the plot. He could finally get on with it, and finish the damn series.So, is the last book worth it? Does it round the series off in style?In short, a resounding yes.It's not perfect, and I'd like to get the negatives out of the way first. The decision to make one book two once again shows here, with us spending a hell of alot of time at the start of the book with Roran in Aroughs. While reading about how clever Roran is was very entertaining, the entire siege added very little to the plot. Aroughs was not even mentioned in the previous three volumes, and spending so much time on the place just feels like more filler, a terrible thing that hampered book three terribly. Similiary, the book again seems to slow to a stop as we watch Elain give birth. This whole event, again, adds nothing to the overall plot, and in a book where you are practically begging the author to get on with it and finally show us Galbatorix, it is a little frustrating. In fact, the first 100 pages were very like Brisingr, as Paolini labours to tie up every single loose end for every single charactor.Then, we go to Dras-Leona, and the book begins to improve. It is here I began to notice that, after being so bored with nothing happening in Brisingr, the massive improvement on this volume is that there is so much happening! It shoves away its slow pacing from the last book and jumps head first into the dive towards its conclusion. The characters do not get a moment of reprieve, as Murtagh kidnaps Nasuada and we finally, FINALLY, get to meet Galbatorix.Immediately, the decision to keep him out of the action for the first three books seems like a sensible one. Galbatorix is just TOO powerful. To have Eragon or the other characters elude him or outsmart him before now would have diminished that effect. Having such a powerful character does create problems for writers, but Paolini keeps these problems to a minimum. And the end result is not a dissapointment. Galbatorix seems practically omniscient as well as omnipotent. As a reader, you find yourself screaming at the page "VAULT OF SOULS, VAULT OF SOULS!!" as it looks more and more likely that he will be defeated. His torturing of Nasuada shows both how twisted and evil he is, and how torn and broken Murtagh is. If anything seems off here, it is that Murtagh's sudden change of character, highlighted by the fact he has fallen in love with Nasuada, feels a little forced. Though he shows Eragon mercy in Eldest, it still remains very inconsistant how Murtagh is feeling, and where his true intentions lie. In all his battles with Eragon post Eldest, he had always strove to win, and commmitted some truley evil deeds while doing so. Yet, here, it's almost like his sudden change to the good side seems forced, which Paolini tries to hide with his love for Nasuada, a woman who he has had next to no interaction with in previous volumes.So on we go, to a huge show down between Eragon and Galbatorix, with a massive battle in the background. And, despite really enjoying the sequence of events, they do seem a little anticlimatic. Eragon never fights with Galbatorix, not really. There is no Eragon/Saphira vs Galbatorix/Shurikan, which it really felt like the entire series had been leading towards. The death's of both the king and his dragon also seemed very rushed to me. Shurikan especially was definately wasted. I would have liked to see him do some damage, though I suppose if he had been allowed to fly on the Varden, there would have been no Varden left.It is only right that I now mention Eragon, who really shines in this novel. His journey to the Rock of Kuthian, his journey to find his name and of course his journey to kill Galbatorix are superb reading. By the end of the book, not only is he immensly powerful but wise also, something which he has lacked up untill this point. His experiences change him and it shows just how much the journey has transformed this poor farm boy into a strong, powerful and wise leader of a new generation of Dragon Riders. As Eragon accepted his fate, to leave everything and everyone behind and begin anew with all the eggs, the book became immensly sad. The final few chapters round everything off nicely, and I defy people to not feel teary, especially when Eragon returns one final time to Brom's tomb, and has a desperate idea to rise the father he never knew. His final goodbyes to everyone, especially Arya, are very emotional, as we as the reader are also saying goodbye, to the characters, to Alageasia, to Eragon himself. The ending for Arya and Eragon was bitter sweet as it needed to be. It would not be in Arya's character to turn round at the end and offer herself to Eragon. But the promise of a potential union between the two, even if unlikley, strikes the perfect balance.And so it ends. Conclusions are hard. There will be always something that upsets the fans, and something they feel that the writers missed. But, I geniunly feel Paolini couldn't have done better. This book was the book I wanted, even if the death of Galbatorix didn't quite live up to my expectations. He has just about redeemed Brisingr by forcing me to grudginly admit that the story would have indeed suffered had it been condensed to cover not just this volume but the events of the previous also. And he left a few mysteries to keep the idea of a 5th book open. The story does end, but it does not mean another cannot now begin.Farewell Eragon. May the stars watch over you, Dragon Rider.
