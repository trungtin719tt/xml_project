OMFG!!!!! Okay, "The End For Now." Who ends a book like that????!!!! And I was just starting to like Heath!!!!!!! I was totally Blissed out that she finally dumped that asshat Eric, But I was just starting to like Heath! He wasn't a Stark, but he did get really sweet!!!!!Random thought-Zoey beat one of Aphrodites' latest death visions. I really don't think there is any way for her to fall for Kolana now.But...dadadummmm....she only altered another one. She didn't drown on the island with Stark just out of her reach. Her soul shattered with Stark just out of her reach. I think it had the same intended affect.DAMN!!!! WHEN DOES BURNED COME OUT???????!!!!!!!!!!
