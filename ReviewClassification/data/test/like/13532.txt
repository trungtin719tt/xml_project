Such a gem to read and have on your bookshelf, full of magic and mysticism, love and romance. One the most beautifully crafted books I've read in a long time, the story line is very simple and has been written about in other reviews ,what makes it extra special is the voice of the narrator Sorcha (sor-ca), she tells her story with such a simple yet very emotive voice that can bring the reader to tears in just a few beautifully put together words. Altho this is a hefty book it didn't seem to matter, I was transported in one swoop to Sorchas home Sevenwaters in Ireland to a land filled with greenery and trees and magic and then when a twist in her story takes her to England to a place filled with greenery and trees and evil from which Sorcha requires protection. I toiled with Sorcha, cried with her and fell in love when she did (altho being young and niave she missed the signs). Her story takes some marvellous and sometimes gripping and sometimes sad twists and turns and for one so young her burdens were many (as is so in fairy tales and stories of Myth and Legend) but she was oh so strong and brave and committed to her path and despite being sometimes insecure and emotionally out of her depth she did remarkably well. I loved this story and really look forward to reading the next in the series.
