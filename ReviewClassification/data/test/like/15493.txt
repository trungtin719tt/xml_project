[A 20th-century classic]After reading ' A Town Like Alice' last year, I knew I would be picking up another Nevil Shute's book in no time. Little did I know that he can pull off a dystopian novel like no one else. Unlike the usual messed up version of some kind of future, we are faced with an end of humanity as a result of reckless and stupid nuclear war. It comes as a wave of radiation sweeping across the planet and causing all living things to die. The last largest city left untouched is Melbourne in Australia. And we find all of the book's main characters rooted or stranded in its neighborhood. Mind you, no one is going crazy and looking for some solution because there clearly is none. The author depicts a society living out the last months of their lives knowing that the end is near and very much inevitable.It's simple, uncomplicated, sad and in the end - heartbreaking. You cannot help but feel for everyone and their resolve to go the way they want to go. I don't think it really is a spoiler if I say not to expect a happy ending. The story is about the journey and not the end because the end is already known going in. Well written and moving with a range of characters so that anyone can find someone to associate with. If you don't like the sci-fi style dystopias, this one might be just it to try out the genre.
