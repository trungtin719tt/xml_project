This is a book packed with such genuine emotion and tragedy, put also layered with strength and, most importantly, hope. The strength and bravery exhibited by the author to put behind her everything she has gone through, but also to put it down in a book to help others is so uplifting and inspirational.I recommend this book to anyone who has suffered in any way, and if you are one of the lucky ones without darkness in your past then I recommend you read it too, as you will undoubtedly have loved ones who suffered and this helps gain perspective on that.
