Diana Gabaldon's writing is amazing as she continues guiding me through this life journey with Claire and Jamie. No question that the drama never ceases and readers are now thrown into a full-blown American Revolution where we find Jamie once again facing danger. And the drama only intensifies as Claire also faces forces almost beyond her abilities to overcome and escape. As they grow older, this couple's love only deepens for one another. There are answers to some of the past mysteries and new ones to contemplate. We're treated to more of the family that continues to grow and impacts the storyline with even greater intensity.Off I go to continue my Outlander marathon in Number Seven!
