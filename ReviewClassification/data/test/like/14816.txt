I'm torn. I'm torn between giving this book 5 stars and 1 star. The book is very thought provoking. It is well written, and very evocative of the time (early 70's) and the place (far northern Wisconsin.) This was a book that I had a hard time putting down, and indeed I stayed up too late several nights, and played hooky on chores an entire afternoon, so I could read it instead. I would give the first 500 pages five stars and the last 66 pages one star.I went into this book thinking it was a YA type (and this may be one of the downfalls of a Kindle, you can't tell how really long a book is, or else I don't yet have the right feeling for interpreting the dots that show how far you've read in a book.) But...Yes, it's a story about a 13 year old mute boy living on a dog farm/breeding kennel in the early 70's.Yes, it's a coming of age story.Yes, it's everything that sounds like a really good boy/dog animal story should be.But...Think again. This book is a tragedy more than anything else. It's what you might get if you crossedHamletorKing LearwithOld Yeller.The ending is very heavy on the Shakespearian side of the scale. If I wasn't reading on an electronic device I might have thrown the book across the room after finishing the last paragraph. I felt so cheated by the ending. I wanted a happy ending, or at the very least redemption &amp; feeling good, and that's not where I am. At all. Right now I really wish there was someone else around who had read it so I could talk about it.I thought this was going to be a warm, fuzzy, boy &amp; his dog coming of age story that would be a fun summer read. It's not, this book is a tragedy pure but not simple. The more I think about it the more connections I am finding to King Lear.Edit: From the author, this is actually a retelling of Hamlet.
