House of Hades was just indescribable! It was soo good! After I finished it, I was SOO DAMN excited for the next book! But THEN, I saw The Blood of Olympus's publication date...OCTOBER 7TH 2014Seriously?!?!?!? SERIOUSLY?!?!?!?!Rick Riordan, you do want your fans to be alive to actually read the book, right? I guess not. Are you REALLY gonna make us wait tillOCTOBER 7TH 2014?!?!! FREAKIN' 2014!?!?!I am soo gonna die waiting. I mean it, cause..After all the action and drama that happened in House of Hades, you're really gonna make us wait oneWHOLEyear?!?!?!I think I'm gonna die..Well, it doesn't really matter what we say cause the book won't be released any faster. So.. I might as well right my predictions about it.Here goes...My predictions of The Blood Of Olympus---Deaths.Loads of deaths. It's obvious that there are gonna be deaths. For a war to be won there has to be deaths. And even though I hate to admit it, I am one hundred percent sure that one of the seven chosen demigods.. will die. Cause a hero has to die. Otherwise the story will just seem tooo perfect.I'm just praying that it isn't Percy or Annabeth, cause even though I like the other characters, I Absolutely Love Percabeth. (Notice the capital letters? Yeah,I love them that much!) I almost cried at the end of The Mark Of Athena. But, I didn't cause I had the House of Hades already. I know, lucky me. I feel really sad for the fans who had to wait one whole year for it. I wonder how that felt...Well, I'm gonna find out now!But really, after all the things that Percy and Annabeth have gone through in all the books, SPECIALLY after all the things they have gone through together in Tartarus, I will be heartbroken if either one of them dies. But it doesn't matter how heartbroken I will be because,You cannot kill them. You cannot. CANNOT.C-A-N-N-O-T.Don't kill Leo either. Kill someone else. Kill Frank or Hazel instead. Sorry to all their shippers but I don't really like them that much. SO, if they do die, I'd be sad but not that much.But, ourdear Rick*please note the sarcasm*, is known for giving lots of unexpected twists and turns. I am just praying that he doesNOT, in a tragic turn of events let all the chosen seven live and instead kill Nico. Honestly, even after his secret was out, I still think he's a very strong demigod. And, I hope that he doesn't die.The Great Prophecy."Seven half-bloods shall answer the call"--- The seven half-bloods have already been chosen. They are Percy, Annabeth, Jason, Piper, Leo, Frank and Hazel. Quite an unique pair."To storm or fire the world must fall"--- Storm could mean either Jason or Percy or maybe even both of them together. Fire is most probably Leo. And here 'world' means Gaia, most probably. So, Gaia will be stopped, it's just a matter of what or whom she will be stopped by."An oath to keep with a final breath"--- I have a mini heart attack everytime I think about this line. Cause someone's gonna die!!! And my mind is too busy hyperventilating right now to remember any of the oath made by any of the demigods. They all made promises though.Leo made one to Calypso. Please don't let Leo die.Percy made one to Annabeth. Please don't let Percy die.Nico made one to Percy. Please don't let Nico die.JUST DON'T KILL THEM PLEASE RICK!!I BEG YOU!!!!PLEASE DON'T KILL THEM!!!PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE!!! PRETTY PLEASE WITH A CHERRY ON TOP!!!Well. Carrying on."And foes bear arms to the Doors of Death"--- At first, I thought foes meant the Greeks and the Romans together. But, after reading House of Hades, I think a few Titans and Giants -maybe even monsters!- will turn good and help the demigods and the gods in defeating Gaia.The demigods will win the war.The demigods will win the war. Both the camps will fight together along with the help of the gods. I am abso-freakin-lutely sure about that. Cause after soo many books, if the fans don't get a happy ending, Rick is gonna be in trouble. But I'm pretty sure we'll get a happy ending. After all, we do trust the demigods, don't we?Percabeth.Percy and Annabeth will probably go back to camp together. Maybe they'll go to New Rome in Camp Jupiter if they can. Cause Percy did plan on living in New Rome with Annabeth. But then again, Annabeth wanted to stay in Camp Half-blood, didn't she?Let's just hope that the two camps won't be fighting with each other anymore after the war with the giants end. Maybe.. maybe the long-lasting rivalry between them will end. I don't care if Octavian has to die for it to happen. Kill him. See if I care.Jasper.Jason and Piper. Jason and Piper might stay in Camp Half-Blood cause they both seem to like it better than the Roman camp. It doesn't really matter to me what they do, I just wanna know what will happen with Percabeth. But, I do hope that Jason and Piper don't die. I like them a lot and if they died, it would be quite depressing.Frank and Hazel.I think I already expressed my opinion about them when I said that I wouldn't be that sad if they die. But, can you blame me? Frank is all big and Mars-y and all win-this-war type-y. And Hazel came back from the dead, and she didn't even know what chicken nuggets are!!!Caleo.I really hope that Leo and Calypso end up together. I am rooting for them!!! I never forget how Nemesis told Leo that he would always be the seventh wheel and I hated that she said that! Leo's so cool, he would never end up alone! So please please please please PLEASE let them end up together!!Happy ending.There's gonna be a happy ending. Maybe the camps will be situated closer to each other, even! And, I'm guessing that the gods will care more about the kids and be more 'interactive' with them and hopefully, it will all be for the best!Oh Damn. Now I just want the books more. I'm pretty sure that Rick's just sitting there all like,Rick...GIVE ME THE BOOK ALREADY!!!!I NEED THE DAMN BOOK NOW!!! GIVE IT TO ME ALREADY!!!UPDATE: I HAVE FINALLY FINISHED READING THIS BOOKThe wait was very long. It was painful, really. But then, I kinda got over the hype. You can't blame me for waiting two more years to read this. I read the other nine in one go and then I have to wait a year?? Then school got in the way and all that jazz BUT HEY, I'm finally done with this series!I'm really going to miss the characters a lot and just everything about this series.Honestly, this book did not meet my expectations. The demigods did a great job, as always, but everything was just too... perfect? Every obstacle that was thrown in their way, they overcame it somehow. AND DON'T GET ME WRONG, that's a good thing, it's great! But, come on. They're seven demigods fighting againstsomany giants! They even wake up Gaia but the gods decide to swoop in,literally, at exactly that point??Maybe I've grown up too much since the last book? Or I just expected too much from the final book in the series?I don't exactly know why I was disappointed.But BoO didn't get four stars for nothing. There was a lot of development among the characters. They had gotten so used to fighting side by side, sometimes they didn't need words. Percabeth and Jasper were as cute as before, if not even more adorable. I even grew a liking towards Frank and Hazel!I didn't think much of Reyna before but I somewhat respected her in this book. She's been through so much and she's still so strong. Really hoping that whatever Aphrodite said wasn't right.I was glad that Leo could make it back to Calypso but I was wondering how? You could only go to that island once, right? What bothered me more was that Calypso was literally standing there with her bags packed. It was eh, cute, but not the kind of ending that I had wanted. But, I'm not even sure about what I want anymore...AND NICO. MY BABY.I have so so so much love for him. He didn't have to take the responsibility to take back the Athena Parthenon but HE DID IT ANYWAY. I was so scared that he was going to die, I was just waiting for it. Buuuut, it never came and I couldn't have been happier. Oh, is Will gay? Will and Nico seemed very rushed, to be honest.Octavian's death was very expected. No feelings about that, to be honest. He just wasn't right in the head.I guess my favourite scene was when Annabeth and Piper went to that temple of fear and panic. For once, Annabeth's plans were of no use and Piper really proved herself. She didn't try to be logical, she let her emotions take over and she saved them both! If anyone still thought that Piper was a harmless daughter of Aphrodite who couldn't fight, they would be proven WRONG.Really loved that scene. And the entire book, I guess. But it just felt like something was missing!Anyway, I do hope the gods keep their word this time and is it okay if I hope for more books about the demigods?Yes?Yes? OKAY!For anyone still hesitating to read this book, I'd tell you to give it a shot. The entire series is great and the fandom too. The fans are amazing people and I've made so many friends in this fandom, gosh, I don't want this to end!!
