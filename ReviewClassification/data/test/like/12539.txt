I found The Alienist to be a fascinating and exciting read. This historical fiction takes place in New York City just before the turn of the century and revolves around the activities of one of the first forensic investigations in world history. To try and catch a serial killer targeting young boys, a team of unlikely allies are pulled together by none other than Theodore Roosevelt, then a NY City Police commissioner. The team quickly discover that to solve this case will require them to research, analyze and even empathize with a man who is equal parts predator and prey.Carr's mastery of the setting for this story is astounding. His vivid descriptions of turn of the century New York make you feel that you are right there with the characters. You can see and smell the immigrant slums. You can hear the sounds of street vendors and horse hooves on cobblestone streets. With a background in non-fiction, he has very clearly done his homework for this novel.I found the dialogue itself to be very catchy. Not being a subject matter expert, I'll suffice it to say that it 'felt' authentic. And the cast of characters, including Roosevelt himself, seem to jump right out of history itself for the show.My one disappointment of the novel was it's climax. Although pseudo 'gotcha' was achieved, it felt a tad on the contrived side. I won't spoil anything, naturally, so you'll have to judge for yourself. The ending, as well, left something to be desired, I think.Short of those points, however, I truly enjoyed this novel from cover-to-cover. It reminded me what adventure awaits us when we put a little spin on history and see what happens. If you like an intellectual adventure ride in your historical fiction, you should certainly give The Alienist a shot.
