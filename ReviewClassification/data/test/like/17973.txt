I haven't read a single book by this author that didn't make my stomach do flip flops every few chapters. Can somebody please explain to me how this is possible? I don't do sappy romances. Don't get me wrong, Iloveromantic stuff, but just not too much of it. It's hard to explain, but there is a fine line between OMG WOW and OMG EW. I'm hard to please, yes, what's your point?Simone Elkeles (I can never read that name without hearing that ridiculous rap video of Perfect Chemistry in my head) only writes about over the top romances. AND I JUST INHALE IT LIKE IT'S GODDAMN APPLE PIE.I look like a 16-year old girl with pigtails while I read her books. I blush, I grin, I giggle, I gasp, I squeal and I live through every moment like they're my own.GAH. This is so frustrating.
