I'm giving this book five stars because I can't find it in me to give it any less. I wouldn't say that I enjoyed this book, a well written tale so wrought with lost dreams, pining for the love of a father, incest, depression, longing, the blurred line between love and hate... I will say that I'm grateful for having read it.
