But I look at it anyway, because it also reminds me that I'm going to find the boy who took everything away from me. I'm going to kill the boy who killed me, and when I kill him, I'm going to do it with my left hand."WOW.... AMAZING..... I've been thinking about this book all day... wondering where to start with this review. I just don't know where to start. I've read many other reviews that were all amazing, but for some reason I am just speechless. Other than, I really reallyLOVEDthis book. I mean no,REALLY, REALLY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!!!I can't seem to get these characters out of my head. And the story was just compelling..sad...thought provoking...touching...romantic...anger-inducing...inspiring...exasperating...and I could go on and on.To sum it up, it was and incrediblyEMOTIONALbook. I think there wasn't an emotion the body is capable of that I didn't feel while reading this book. And there were as many good emotions as were bad. Okay, well maybe there were a few more negative than positive... but the positive emotions were so incredibly intense that they completely overshadowed the bad in the end.Nastya Kashnikov..."I live in a world without magic or miracles. A place where there are no clairvoyants or shape shifters, no angels or superhuman boys to save you. A place where people die and music disintegrates and things suck. I am pressed so hard against the earth by the weight of reality that some days I wonder how I am still able to lift my feet to walk.Nastya is a 17 year old girl struggling to survive after a random act of violence has changed her life forever. A life that was full of promise, success, love, and music. And out of the blue.... it is all gone. She has been killed...but yet she survives. Unable to function in her current environment due to her unwanted notoriety... Nastya leaves home to live with a distant aunt so she can finish high school in peace. She sets out with a hope for achieving a sense of anonymity and a bit of normalcy in her life. This she learns is really an unattainable goal. On the first day back to school she meetsDrew Leighton. And Drew is all kinds of charm, and he knows it... and uses it daily to work his way into the panties of every available beautiful girl in his vicinity.He's the kind of good looking that transforms once self-respecting females into useless puddles of dumbass."And he is sucked into the vortex that is Nastya right from the beginning. Oh, and she doesn't speak. That's right, NOT AT ALL. Just a bonus as far as Drew is concerned. But Nastya is not falling for it, or anyone else. She does the best she can to stay off the radar. But Drew is persistent. And he does break in to her world, but only as a friend... and a very valuable friend as much as she hates to admit it. But what Drew doesn't realize is that 'Nastypants,' as he so lovingly calls her, is going to change his world forever as well.Then there isJosh Fucking Bennett. The boy with a 10 foot forcefield around him that no one seems to penetrate. And Josh comes with his own set of charms... the quiet, tragic type... and she finds herself drawn to him like a dead star to a black hole."...he's the only person I know who can appear seriously put out with no expression at all on his face. Does everyone irritate him so much, or is it just a special gift I have? He seems immensely disturbed by the fact that I even exist, much less occupy the same space in his precious shop class."The impending relationship that ensues... the healing and pain that follow are just heart wrenching and beautiful to witness. Nastya, still silent, has an incredible journey to make, and unfortunately she wants no part of it. Its so incredibly sad and tragic for one so young to feel she has no more happiness to look forward to in the future."They're laughing and attempting to knot their hair together. It's the height of immature teenage girlishness. I want to mock them for it, but I'm appalled by the fact that it makes me sad. For a moment I feel like a survivor in some post apocalyptic world, looking through a window, imagining a part of my life that's gone now."And the sadness and tragedy are not one-sided. Josh comes complete with his own set of tragic events. And his own sense of solitude. A solitude so profound that Nastya finds herself wanting to share it with him. So she forces her way in... into his bubble of death, so they can wallow in it together."I know at the moment what he's given me and it's not a chair. It's and invitation, a welcome, the knowledge that I am accepted here. He hasn't given me a place to sit. He's given me a place to belong."I just love this couple and all of the flaws that make them perfect together. I loved every second of this story. The good and the bad. It was all laid out so perfectly that it couldn't have happened any other way. I find myself wanting to start reading it again. It was just that good.I could go on for days.. but I won't so I'm just going to give it to you to read instead. You will NOT be disappointed!!!******6 STARS******My character pics...Nastya Kashnikov[image error]Josh Bennett[image error]Drew Leighton[image error]Emilia Ward[image error]
