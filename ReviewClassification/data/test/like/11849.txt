After a nicely paced and quite exciting opening, I was horrified to have a giant rubber stamp of 'Jumping the shark' slammed directly onto my forehead about 10% in, when the 'twist' happens. It seemed to be the most egrecious and lazy of plots, the most stupid of gimmicks, and I was that bloody annoyed by it I almost put the book down. Thankfully, I have my Missus, the woman who spent about seven years gently badgering me to even try Pratchett and who always proclaimed this to be her favourite Discworld novel, and so I grumbled and begrudgingly soldiered on.I bring that up because I fear you might not have someone like my Missus to assure you it's ok, because she was 100% correct, this was sodding astounding.All of Vimes' needling doubts and worries in previous books has been streaming towards this point, the social commentary here is brilliant, the 'gimmick' works smoothly and never once felt corny, every character is perfect (Nobby Nobbs, you poor, sweet little bastard) and, as always, it's hilarious.This also has to be one of the most gory and occassionally disturbing of the Pratchett books, definitely the darkest and at times melancholy, a thousand miles away from the frivolity of the Rincewind novels, and yet all the elements of the Discworld are here and none feel out of place.With a lot of humanity, minimal magic but much intelligence, Pratchett has done the impossible of not only making this shit work, but hammering it into absolute perfection.
