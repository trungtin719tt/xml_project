This is such a precious book of fantasy, of a classic (if it even exists) fantasy tale, of a mage who learns his true nature, who fights himself and his fears to become a better version of himself.The plot is nice and simple, straightforward and entertaining.The writing style is superb, impressive in the simplicity of the delivery. Yet, the words used tend to be of a refined palate; it is pure gold.I dare saying this is felt as a family tale, a book to share with your loved ones; it also feels like a great book to recommend for those who do not know fantasy well or are fantasy beginners.I loved it.
