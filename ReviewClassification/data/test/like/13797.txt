I'm more a fan of "Artificios" than the actual "Ficciones" collection, though "El Jardin" remains one of the better ones from Ficciones. Reading this collection for my Boston book club made me realize that, having taught Borges short stories over the years and reading for my exams as a graduate student, I thought that I had read all of them.But I hadn't; I encountered a few new ones here, namely "The End", which puts an end to the Martin Fierro story. So I've erased Borges from my "read" lists and will reread each anthology. Like Quiroga and Cortazar, he's been anthologized so often that one can find the same short story in several collections, thus making it seem as though you've read them all.I tend to like "Artificios" more than "Ficciones" b/c the stories in "Ficciones" are less what I consider short stories, and more Borges positing his new ideas/concepts. Several really don't contain any plot or plot twists, just the possibility of other dimensons/worlds. Great stuff, especially when you consider that they're his first stories ever, written after a severe head injury. But I do remember, both in grad school and now, "skimming" some of these. Once you've grasped the idea of what he's proposing (the infinite nature of the universe, chaos, the only truth is fiction, etc.) then there's really no need to determine whether or not text X truly existed, or whether Borges made it up. Wonderful to do if you have the time and are so inclined. I remember being frustrated/feeling guilty with this in grad school, thinking that I had to look up each and every reference to these works, or that I was less erudite for not knowing. Also, there's a new one every two sentences, so it really broke up the "stories". Now, I just get the concept and plow through a lot of those references. That's why I prefer "Jardin de los senderos que se bifurcan" and the stories from "Artificios"; they're more in the line of actual stories, that do contain a plot but also posit some of those same ideas and concepts (the way, for example, "La muerte y la brujula" is similar to "Jardin" in its structure, a variation on the same theme, if you will).
