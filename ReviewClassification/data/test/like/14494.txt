The lucky one. Just like the title, mr SParks is telling us about believing in luck. Life is hard and sometimes along the way u encounter luck. Things that u can not explain but just believe on it and hold on tight.The story befins where logan finds a picture of a woman in kuwait during his tour of duty. And after that his luck change. He somehow survived many horrible and even death. He reluctantly believe its because of that picture. So when he was discharged, he searched for the woman in the picture and brings him to beth. A single mother.Like many nicholas sparks book, the story is fully laden with melancholic and tear jearker moments.I loke the book even though i feel its tad too long. Especially building up the chemistry between beth and logan. Nevertheless, i now do believe in luck.4 to find you stars
