031015: this is a later addition: there is a well known critical position that science fiction is the 'literature of cognitive estrangement', where the usual, the mundane, is made 'strange', engaging thought from some slightly different perspective- i just read a critique that verne perhaps operates the other way round, that he makes the 'strange' into the familiar, the mundane, the european world of mid 1800s, so less threatening and somehow maintaining worlds comfortable to readers always explainable in applied science, in engineering, in spite of any fantastic devices or worlds...first review: this is another book i decide to reread that i once gave a five. when i rated that it was by memory, and of that an abridged version. this is a new read, a new translation, a new experience. thus sentiment plays less of a role, but i am unsure how much of this rating is the idea rather than execution...this edition comes with a 60 page introduction, which sets it up well. the text itself is complete, around 430 pages, and of the same vintage as The Wretched (Les Miserables) by Victor Hugo. it is interesting to think of these books as contemporary, of how each works, how different, how similar. also how much of it is images of the disney movie, from which in reading it is hard to escape. this is the good: brass/steampunk visuals of the nautilus, james mason as captain nemo. the bad: kirk douglas as ned land the harpooner (singing!), peter lorre as conseil, the movie pacing and resolution...there is not much to comment on, except to reiterate what critics if not everyone knows by now: the translations read as kids book are bad, abridging is radical, the ideas are beautiful. exact failings of the translations i do not know, as i do not read french. of abridging, well there are many, many, long passages detailing such things as mechanics, science, engineering, then catalogues of fishes, sharks, and other marine life. there is great specificity of latitude, longitude, depth, type of seawater. there is some gesture to the power of electricity, other concepts such as walking undersea, on finding wreckage wealth, of drowned ruins, of pearls beyond measure, of all the ways nemo refuses the land, in food, in fuel, in everything from furniture to ink. these sections are shortened or omitted. at the time perhaps they were needed to give scientific plausibility to the magical experience, by now they are boring, now we read past them, but i enjoy them in an abstract, comic, way... particularly marine life as seen between scientific classification by conseil, and whether they are edible by ned land...other comments: this is the genesis of science fiction as 'hard science' rather than speculative, rather than social science fiction, and the overriding attitude is that everything, however fantastic, has a scientific rationale- even if such is speculative, if such is imaginative license, it is the philosophical principle that science enables and explains everything. so be ready for a lot of science (of 1869). do not read this if you like say, genre romances...
