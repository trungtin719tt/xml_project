4 Stars!What an enjoyable read this was.Blue, a teenage girl lives in a house full of psychic aunts and her mother. Ever since Blue was little, she was told that her true love will die if she kisses him. (That's one way to scare a little child...shit)Blue goes to church with her Aunt Neeve on St. Mark's Eve, which is when the spirits of those who will die in the next twelve months come through. (Nice....)Blue has no psychic ability, but she sees the spirit of a boy named Gansey. Aunt Neeve tells her this is because Gansey is either her true love, or she will kill him.Blue eventually meets Gansey and his group of friends: Adam, Ronan and Noah. The boys go to Aglionby, which is a rich all-boys school, so typically Blue sees them as snobs. HahaBlue slowly develops a friendship with them and joins them on their quest to find ley lines and the buried Welsh King, Glendower.Gasney's been trying to find the Welsh King since he was small and almost died of hornet stings. He refues to give up until he finds Glendower, but the boys and Blue aren't the only ones looking for the ley lines...I liked Blue as a character. I mean, she's a typical teenage girl, and to be honest I find her quite extraordinary too.She lives in a small town, argues with her mother and she hates going to school.Blue has knows since she was a child what will happen to her when she falls in love, and I don't think anyone would want that. Blue knows that her love life can't end well because her mother and her aunts are psychic. I'd find it pretty hard to live like a normal teenager if that were to happen to me.When Blue meets Gansey for the first time, she isn't impressed by his confidence and handsome features. Her instant thought is that he's a rich snob and that she can't imagine to ever fall in love with him. Haha!Gansey has his own apartment, tries to pay people for their time and thinks nothing of a lot of money.HE'S RICH BASICALLY.Overall this was a light read and I enjoyed it.
