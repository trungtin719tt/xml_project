One of the greatest failures of the Pulitzer Prize for fiction was the prize committee's decision not to award any prize in 1977. A jury of writers had read the year's best fiction and had presented Maclean's novella to the prize committee (the committee who votes on every prize) as their winner. The prize committee was unable to come to a majority decision and when this happens they simply don't award the prize that year. It's happened a few times, the most recent in 2013, but it's that 1977 decision that most baffles me as Maclean's story is brilliant and beautiful. I have read every Pulitzer fiction winner and finalist from 2000 to the present, and of those years (generally a year has 3 finalists one of which is the winner) A River Runs Through It not only belongs but still manages to stand out.The novella is a nostalgic look back at Maclean's youth and young adulthood in early 20th century Montana, and while you'll often hear this book described as one about fly fishing, this is not so. Yes, you'll read about fly fishing, but it is simply the vehicle Maclean uses to tie his family and their experiences together. The sons of a minister, Norman and his brother Paul learn to fly fish from their strict but loving father and he instructs them in such a way that they spend memorable time with their father and each other. Both become excellent fishermen and in their 20's, about the only time they spend together is fly fishing with Norman being married and Paul having moved about 40 miles away.Maclean has a rare talent for story telling and is a brilliant observer. These observations color his stories and he is able to describe a scene so vividly that at times this book feels photographic. I read to feel. I don't necessarily care about plot or action or twists, though I have nothing against those things, they're important. I can feel what Maclean writes almost as if I were experiencing it myself. His prose is at times transcendent, and though he may simply be relating an anecdote about his wife being angry with him, they'll have a two sentence exchange that thoroughly transmits the feel of a good and happy marriage, so apt based on my own experiences that I sense his message at my core. A simple sit down next to his father yields a brief conversation that strikes at the very heart of a father's love for his son and a son's for his father. Though on the surface they appear to be speaking of fishing, Maclean has essentially used his novella to construct a Rosetta Stone for the language of the soul and much deeper meanings are intuited.Perhaps what I find most meaningful about A River Runs Through It is its recognition that though the universe may seem callous and cruel, life is still often beautiful and that the people that make it worth living are also often the ones at the center of our hard times. Maclean also recognizes the renewing power of nature and its ability to help us find focus and purpose. Yes, I read to feel, and I stand in awe of a talent like Maclean whose ability to almost secretly convey such depths of human emotion in the relating of seemingly simple anecdotes has few peers.
