YES!!! I'm finished!!!!!! Review to come!OKAY, I think I have waited long enough to write this review. So let's get down to biz shall we?Upon reading this book, I wasn't sure if I wanted to. After reading Perfect Chemistry, I was convinced I wouldn't like the other books or other brothers near as much as I loved Alex Fuentes. I was obsessed with the sexy mexy!!!! But friends kept telling me I would love this one as much as more. SO, I decided what the Hell I will give it a shot. WOOOOOOOOOOW! I was so surprised by how much I loved this book. I devoured every page. The story was different and nothing short of amazing. The characters were utterly and absolutely unforgettable!!! Simone Elkeles has floored me again with her awesomeness, though I shouldn't be surprised since each book of hers that I read gets better and better!!! I LOVED RULES OF ATTRACTION! I LOVED CARLOS FUENTES! OMG!!! The HOT N STEAMY SEXUAL TENSION IS FUCKING UHHHHHH-MAZING! It was as good as Obsidian, between Daemon and Katy. Fucking Hell I thought I was gonna faint from the hot sticky sweat I was producing. But not only that, the relationship between the other characters was awesome as well. I loved this story more than Perfect Chemistry...though Alex is still my #1. OH AND WE GET TO SEE ALEX AND BRIT IN THIS STORY TOO! It was wonderful!Story:Carlos Fuentes moves to Colorado from Mexico to live with Alex and Brit. Things are a bit difficult for Carlos because he feels out of place. He is still in the mindset of a gangbanger and is a bit of a rebel. He likes to party hard and hook up with chicks just because he can. He meets Madison who is the popular girl in school and they have alot of fun together. He thinks he's hot shit and the king of world.Kiara Westford is an average girl at the school who speaks her mind but stutters when she's nervous. Her best friend Tuck is always there to make her feel special. Her dad is a professor and doesn't take shit from anyone though, his thing in life is to help those who are in trouble and want to better themselves. He always sees past all the bad things and believes anyone can make a difference.Carlos causes problems between Alex and Brit and gets in trouble for drug possession in school, eventhough it wasn't his. The professor allows Carlos to live with his family to keep him from going to jail. Things get a little hectic when Carlos and Kiara butt heads. He doesn't like following rules...the professor doesn't put up with shit. It gets interesting and soon Carlos realizes there's more to life than partying, booze and sex. And he also realizes there are actually people who care about him and want him to succeed in life. Carlos was always afraid to get close to anyone since they always left him. But Kiara and her family won't dare give up on him-with the help of Alex. Nothing is what it seems and sometimes, you just have to believe in yourself.MY THOUGHTS:Wow, this book was amazing! So different from Perfect Chemistry which I loved because they are both unique and special and amazing in their own ways. But nonetheless, I couldn't get enough of these characters! I loved getting to see more of Alex and Brit and their relationship. I also loved getting to see Carlos and Kiara and their blossoming relationship as well.
