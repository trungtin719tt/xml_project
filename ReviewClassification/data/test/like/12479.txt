RE-READ January 30, 2019 - Do you ever notice how Colonel Brandon is a man, who steps up and takes care of things like a man? Edward is kind of useless, I think Marianne got the real prize here.Also fascinating just how much Austen is saying in this novel. She's saying A LOT and more and more becomes clear to me on every re-read. The scene where Willoughby shows up to confess to Elinor when Marianne is ill was particularly striking to me this time. What does this say about 'bad people' and the nature of their 'bad acts?' How does Elinor respond?It's also really fascinating what Austen is saying about Marianne in this book. How illness and heartbreak change her and reshape her into a stronger, less selfish person. But at the same time, Austen does not condemn Marianne for her strong feelings and her runaway heart in the first 2/3 of the book. In fact, it is esteemed a bit. And is Marianne really selfish? That could be debated six ways to Sunday.The book is very complex. There is a lot to think about.RE-READ September 6, 2015This is one of my all-time favorite books. I like it even more than I do Pride and Prejudice.Everyone goes crazy over Lizzie Bennett and idolizes her, but my role model will always be Elinor Dashwood. She is a great sister, a trustworthy confidante, someone who always acts with honor and compassion. She is smart, fiscally responsible, stoic, and strong. I admire her so much and wish I could be more like her in real life.I hate John Dashwood and want to punch him in the throat. Fucker. It surprises me each time that he is the most hated character for me in the novel.Everyone hates on Marianne, but I like her. So she's a silly teenager! That's okay. She certainly learns and grows more than anyone else in the whole novel. She has a good heart and loves her sister dearly - I adore the scenes where she stands up for Elinor!The loving sister relationship is one of the best things about this novel. Nothing melts my heart more than good sibling relationships. And Elinor and Marianne have each other's backs 100%. Even though their personalities couldn't be more different, their love and compassion for each other knows no bounds.Austen is genuinely funny. I was snickering at some of her writing. She's an amazing author. She gets some jabs in there.Elinor agreed to it all, for she did not think he deserved the compliment of rational opposition.The most hilarious line in the novel:"It is not everyone," said Elinor, "who has your passion for dead leaves."The only man who was attractive to me was Colonel Brandon. He was the only male who had me drawing little hearts in my notebook. I can't be bothered with Edward. I don't think he acted very honorably. &gt;.&lt; Although I always tear up at the end when Elinor is so overcome with emotion that she runs from the room!Elinor could sit no longer. She almost ran from the room, and as soon as the door was closed, burst into tears of joy, which at first she thought would never cease.OMG My heart is breaking so much. &lt;3 If anyone deserves a happy ending, it's her.Elinor was to be the comforter of others in her own distresses, no less than in theirs...She never burdens others with her problems, but is always there to comfort and listen to anyone else. The way she deals with Lucy Steele! She's a saint to put up with that, OMG!She's beyond amazing.(view spoiler)[Marianne restored to life, health, friends, and to her doting mother, was an idea to fill her heart with sensations of exquisite comfort, and expand it in fervent gratitude; but it led to no outward demonstrations of joy, no words, no smiles.(hide spoiler)]All within Elinor's breast was satisfaction, silent and strong.Tl;dr - An amazing book, one I'm sure to read over and over again. This never ceases to be enjoyable! And I LOVE love love the film versions. I have watched them innumerable times! The 2008 BBC version with Morahan is the absolute BEST, IMO. I've included a list at the bottom of this review in case anyone wants to see some awesome film adaptations on this amazing novel.Film Versions:1995 Emma ThompsonBBC 2008 Hattie MorahanBBC 1981 Irene Richard2011 From Prada to Nada - Modern retelling(1971 BBC Joanna David)(2000 BollywoodI Have Found It, starring the stunningly gorgeous beyond belief Aishwarya Rai)
