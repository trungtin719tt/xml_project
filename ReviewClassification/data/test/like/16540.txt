The Wizard and the Glass had to piss a lot of people off when it came out. The book is 95% a story from Roland's past - a tale the intertwines several genres including western, romance, and fantasy. And it proves Stephen King can do it all.This backstory is in many ways far better than the main plot line. It had suspense, excellent plotting and pacing, a plethora of well-developed characters - everything about it was perfect... well, except my only complaint about the book(view spoiler)[ the villains, for the most part, meet their ends without that feeling of a final conflict where the heroes' lives balance on a tightrope (in short, they died too easily - Jonas, Lengyll, Depape, Thorin, Rimer, Reynolds (somewhere down the line) and the Tick-Tock Man (who had so much potential) in the main story line, resurrected for absolutely nothing - only Latigo really had that struggle). But of course, when matched against a gunslinger, these failed men perhaps should have died easy(hide spoiler)]But perhaps the book's best quality is its obvious parallels between Ka-tet A and Ka-tet B. Roland's first band - Cuthbert, Alain, Susan, and Sheemie - is in part resurrected with Eddie, Jake, Susannah, and Oy. The characters hold such blatant similarities that I need not go into them, with the most-notable variance being that Susan is perhaps strong when circumstances require it while Susannah is tough and gritty all around.The characters from the past enrich the characters of the present and the story of the longest walk ever taken, as well. It shed greater light on Roland, and created more questions, particularly as to who he might become. Hero? Villain? Victim?This book is fantastic. It makes me want to re-read the Gunslinger, the portions that pertain to people in Roland sees in the glass. And it makes me want to read on, to follow the path of the beam to the Dark Tower, should the damned thing take me in my fool's errand.Also... and I just want to reiterate this...I love Oy.
