I must have enjoyedLover Revealed(Black Dagger Brotherhood #4) because I read all of its 455 pages in less than two days! Once you start one of these books you just have to keep going straight through to the end!This one tells the story of Butch and Marissa and it held quite a few surprises. I enjoyed the way the author dealt with the problem that Butch was a human living in the vampire world, and she even managed to make unlikeable Marissa tolerable by the end. There were also several lesser story lines which made the whole book much more interesting and which are obviously going to be developed in future books.Book three is still my favourite in the series so far but this one was also very entertaining indeed. I am looking forward to the next:)
