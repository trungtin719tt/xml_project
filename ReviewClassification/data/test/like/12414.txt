Being a writer can make you an extremely poor - and biased - reader. Over the years, as fears and frustrations keep piling up, you're tempted to dismiss contemporary masters, geniuses writing at the same day and age as you do; why should you endure the pain of realizing you'll never be that great? And yet I've always known that if I gave in to this ungenerous voice, and refrained from reading as avidly as I do, I'd become an even worse writer than the one I fear I am in my darkest moments.This was a far from necessary preamble, and has nothing to do with Franzen's masterpiece. I've read the book that made Franzen as huge as he deserves to be seven times - yep, I'm obsessed with the guy - and it keeps getting better and better.Do yourself a favor and read this splendor of a novel - and then go ahead and read Freedom as well (Pat may well be one of the best-developed female characters to have been conjured by a male author) and Purity too, which may be Franzen's best, even if I haven't yet managed to reread it, though I definitely will.No shame in being a groupie; sometimes it just can't be helped.
