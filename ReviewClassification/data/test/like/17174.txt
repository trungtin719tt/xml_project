Oh, Geez. I don't even know what to say about this one. It was like watching an extra juicy episode ofKeeping Up With The Kardashians. It doesn't give you a lot of reasons to like it... and yet you can't look away. The melodrama was real.Also, I wanna give a quick FU to all the Lyon Burkes out there in real life.
