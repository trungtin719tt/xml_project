A wonderful collection of Robert Frost's poetry and 2 plays. In hindsight, I wish I would have kept a running list of the poems I loved the most. Of course,The Road Not Takenwould be right up there among the best. One of his later poems I enjoyed wasThe Milky Way is a Cowpath. I love Frost's sense of humor; he never seems to take himself (or anything) too seriously compared to some poets. He never seems to be overwrought about any subject which makes his work easier to relax with. I prefer his rhyming poetry to his free verse. Then again, I prefer rhyming to free verse for any poet. I don't care for Frost's plays. He officially is my new,favorite poet. I look forward to reading more poetry when I get caught up with some of my backlog of reading.
