4 StarsSo confession:I originally snagged this book after waiting so long to read it, because I was able to snag it on sale for $1.99 on amazon kindle.Halfway through reading it, I realized I was really enjoying it...And I knew I would want to read the rest of the series...And then I saw how pretty the covers were...AND they were cheaper than the kindle versions at the time of this review.So, of course, I bought the last two books in the physical.And of course, God forbid I have an unfinished set.Geez.So much for saving money.Nice work, Val.Anynonsense, this book has been reviewed at length, so I'll keep this brief.This was for me what I though the firstCourtbook would be. Meaning that it read fast and the story kept me entertained. I was never bored and things never felt tedious. Everything flowed and I was interested cover to cover. I say interested - and not enthralled, mind you, thus why four and not five stars. Also, I could have done with some stronger world building to start.I have nothing else to add that thousands of other reviewers I'm sure mentioned, so I'll stop here.I really like Bardugo's writing style and look forward to book two.
