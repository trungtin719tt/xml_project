So freaking cute and hilarious!Rachel Hawkins is a queen, when it comes to these terms! I've read Rebel Belle this year, fell in love and now it is one of my absolute favourites of this year. So, normally I had to read something else by this amazing author. Since I was 15 I was eyeing this book but unfortunately never picked it up. I'm so dumb.I loved Hex Hall!Our main protagonist is funny as hell. I just adored her wit and her sassiness!I can't wait to continue with this series, especially after this cruel ending. Seriously, what is it with authors and their nasty endings? :D STOP IT. :P Okay I lied, don't stop. I love being tortured! :'D
