Throughout the entire 562 pages of this excruciating book, Jung Chang wallows in self-pity in the most abject fashion. Nonetheless, it merits five stars or more because of the way it tells the story from the ground level of the fall the Qing dynasty, the attempt of the Kuomintang to create a modern state, the creation of a communist regime in China, the Great Leap forward and Mao's cultural revolution. Chang is rich in detail and has a remarkable sense of what needs to be explained to the western reader. This book for many years ahead will be invaluable to anyone wishing to understand the turmoil that China went through in the 20th century.Like Victor Klemperer's "I will bear Witnesss" or Anne Frank's "Diary", "Wild Swans" is a document of incredible value in helping outsiders understand a very horrible period in history. Because most readers appear to have enjoyed Chang's maudlin style more than I did, I urge everyone to read this book which has so much to tell us. Most will find that it offers many pleasures. Much as I admire the depth and quality of its details, I remain appalled by its weepy tone.
