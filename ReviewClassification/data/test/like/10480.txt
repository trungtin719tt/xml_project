I am really kinda speechless after reading this book. Saying that I LOVED IT is kinda putting it mildly. Honestly, the other paranormal books I have read in the past few months have paled in comparison to these books so far. What makes it so different is the camaraderie between the Brothers and the heroes themselves are so unique in their own way.Rhage is such a womanizer. I really didn't know if I would like him or not. But, as the storyline progressed and his true nature starts to reveal itself, he was easily one of my favorite heroes of all time. He definately rates top 5 easily. For such a bad-ass, he was so tender and loving with Mary. His sacrifice at the end for her was amazing. I loved him. He is worthy of a happily ever after.Mary is another really well written heroine. I really liked her. I felt her insecurities, her hope that she may get better and the love she had for Rhage and the beast within him.Get your tissues out girls because I cried in this book. When Mary finally breaks down in front of Rhage, I literally had to put the book down and wipe my eyes for several minutes.It's not all sadness and tears. It has some very funny moments in it. It is just the total package all around.Gosh between Wrath and Rhage I don't know which one I liked the best.Now I am off to read Z's story...I have a feeling I will like this one too!
