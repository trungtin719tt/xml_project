I loved the way he started this book - with the fable... I found parallels to the life of Jesus - the messiah of the Bible. There are so many inspiring quotable lines. I liked this one best: `Learning is finding out what you already know. Doing is demonstrating that you know it. Teaching is reminding others that they know just as well as you. You are all learners, doers, and teachers'. Maybe because I'm a teacher? But I always loved that line. Even before I became a teacher :)I think the idea that everyone is capable of performing miracles is powerful. I also agree with Don's observation that people want miracles, not learning how to perform them. They want their fish, they don't want to learn how to catch them and feed themselves and others.
