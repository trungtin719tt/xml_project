I have 3 thoughts1) I hate you Brandon Sanderson. You better pay for some therapy sessions because my heart can't take anymore.2) I WORKED OUT WHO THE HERO OF AGES WAS BEFORE IT WAS REVEALED! I feel so accomplished3) Why did I take so long to read these books?And now I shall resume my rocking back and forth and crying in the fetal position. Goodbye
