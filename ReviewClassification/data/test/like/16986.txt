I clearly remember the scene in Black Hawk Down, that soldier(forgotten the name and the actor's name, Tom Hardy maybe), he popped into chopper cabin, holding this book, a paperback edition with the coverThis scene engraved in my mind more than the Joel Schumacher film didThat soldier was one of the 18 casualties :(
