I just finished Dead and Gone and I must say that I loved it. I agree with previous reviews that it was much darker than previous Sookie's but I see that as a good thing. Life is changing Sookie and she is shedding some of her idealism, which is something all of us must face to some degree or another to find our own truths.This books has many painful losses, but it also has a significant amount of growth on the parts of many of our main characters. I too am anxious for the next book if for no other reason than to see the full manifestation of Eric's growth and feelings for Sookie (which are well touched on in Dead and Gone); and to see Sookie (I hope) reach a mature balance in her feelings for Bill. I predict she will love Bill but never again be "in love" with him - but Ms. Harris has more to say about that than I do. Time will tell.CH has said that Sookie will find her love but she is undecided if that will be at the end of the series. I find there is still a lot of potential for story arcs if Sookie ends up with Eric. There is still much strife ahead of them to be dealt with, even if they do end up together (which is my personal preference). Even with all the plot points still left to be dealt with I agree that this addition to the series moved several plots along, found some closure with some, and left plenty of questions still hanging out there.Brava Ms. Harris, it was worth the wait!
