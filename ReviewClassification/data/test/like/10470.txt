This... iconic book. This may be one of the books I've reread most in my life. I love this book so much.I don't even know what to say about this book other than it's one of my favorites ever. It somehow fits every age group - I appreciate it just as much now as when I was ten.The Westing Game is a brilliant logic puzzle. It's a mystery with all the clues lined up, but you won't get the solution. Trust me, you won't.You'll just scream at the end when you figure everything out.I'm shocked that any author was able to develop the solution and set everything up so well.Every time I read this, I notice a new clue.This book also succeeds because of its well-rounded characters. Turtle, Angela, Flora, JJ, and Ted are all well-developed, interesting characters. Frankly, all the characters are interesting and memorable, even with so many.Recommended for MG and YA readers alike.
