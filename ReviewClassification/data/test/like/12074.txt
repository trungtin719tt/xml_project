What a shocking novel! In general I like Paulo Coelho books but this one is specially good, I think that is my favourite one. I love the way he approaches to tough issues like suicide or mental illness. This is a book that without any doubt I will recumbent to everyone that want to rediscover the meaning of life and the power of death to start living the life we always wanted and not the life that we are supposed to life.
