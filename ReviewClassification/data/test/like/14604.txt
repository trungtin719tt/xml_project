This book was absolutely beautiful.I read it over the summer because I had just taken a photography class and I was interested in a lot of related stuff. I found the book on my mom's bookshelf and picked it up mainly because of the fact that the man is a photographer.I read that book in a day, I couldn't put it down. It was probably one of the greatest works I have ever read and possibly will ever read.I would recommendThe Bridges of Madison Countyto anybody who wanted to read a good literature... well, anybody over the age of about 14 or so.
