Easy has been on my tbr list for a while now. So when I was looking for something new to read I came across this and thought it sounded like a good emotionally angsty read. Though this was a good read, it wasn't as deep or emotional as I thought it would be. It dealt with some ugly, dark themes. Like rape in college and others trying to cover it up. I was really glad that they pressed charges on the rapist. I was also so glad the author wrote the friend Erin as a strong supportive friend. I really loved that the president of the women's sorority was like press charges, and support your sister! But for such dark subject matters, this seemed like a lighter read. I loved Jacqueline and Lucas. Apart there was a nice amount of character development. It was their relationship that didn't go deep. It was what was lacking for me. There was so much time apart and they didn't really do a ton of connecting, talking, dating, etc. Still it was a nice read that could have been better if there had been more meat to Jacqueline and Lucas' relationship.
