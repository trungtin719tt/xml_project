So I read this book so long ago and never wrote a review. Words won't suffice the way I feel about this book, I have been reading for a long time and this book is THE BEST BOOK I'VE EVER READ IN MY LIFE. Seriously.. Nothing will ever compare to this series &amp; I will wait everyday in suspense for book 3. Hurry the fuck up please KING SANDERSON I need more.
