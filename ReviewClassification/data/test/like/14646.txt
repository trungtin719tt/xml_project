Surely Nabokov's finest achievement as a writer, his Russian stuff was pretty darn good, but after arriving in the States maybe it was Americanization that pushed him to greater heights and write more than one masterpiece. This novel, is simply put, one of the 20th century's best works, from one of it's best writers. Pale Fire is many things, a Jack-in-the-box, a tour-de-force, a clockwork toy with many components, a chess problem, an enigma, an infernal machine, a trap to catch readers, a cat-and-mouse game, it's a novel that sends your head spinning for all the right reasons. It's also (not what I expected) damn right funny!.Our leading man, Charles Kinbote, is a university teacher brimming with outrageous delusions, and who is obsessed with the old poet John Shade. It's his last poem that get's Kinbote's grey matter going, reaching into the echelons of utter madness!. The result?, a humorous, puzzling, and elegantly imaginative account of one man's insanity, mixing fantasy, reality, truth and lies. Kinbote is a hilariously pompous buffoon to rank alongside literature's greatest characters. He also displays glimmerings of self-awareness which turn him into a rather tragic figure by the finale. After reading Lolita (possibly the best prose I have come across) and Pnin, another mighty fine novel, Pale Fire just raises the bar. A mind-blowing novel to read multiple times.Long live the King of Zembla!
