"Your tale, sir, would cure deafness."The first time I read Shakespeare was when I was around ten years old. I borrowed a collected edition of translated Shakespearian plays from my library just because I heard someone talk about him. I read around half a dozen of his famous plays like a pro.... and everything I read went over my head. There were merchants, betrayal, ghosts, blood, somebody's skull! What's happening?ButTempestwas an exception. My younger version loved that play because it had MAGIC, a sorcerer, a beautiful princess, a funny angel, and a huge ship getting wrecked in a tempest!And now, after more than a decade, I decided to read the grand play again!We are dropped in the middle of an island where the sorcerer,Prosperohas been living in exile with his only daughter for twelve years. He used to be a Duke of Milan, but he was betrayed by his own brother which forced him to leave his home on a small boat. After a tough journey, The boat had reached an Island ruled by an Algerian witch who had imprisoned the angels of that Island. After an epic battle between the Witch and Prospero which ended the reign of the witch, Prospero became the master of the Island.Of course, we don't get to see any of these awesome scenes.For us, the story begins at the dawn of Prospero's ultimate PG-13 version of the revenge. As the ship carrying his enemies passes trough the sea near to his Island, the sorcerer conjures a tempest which brings the visitors to his Island. With the help of his angel, Ariel, he puts his plan in motion.While reading this play for the second time, I found many things which my younger self appropriately overlooked.I found that the mighty Sorcerer is a bit of a douche, the beautiful princess was being used as a pawn by her father, the funny angel was a slave, and the huge ship wrecking was not so huge after all.Yet I found it mesmerizing. I loved the Caliban scenes! And I've always loved Shakespearian prose, especially the insults.Poor worm, thou art infected!----------------------------Shakesperian First DatesFERDINAND:Oh god!
