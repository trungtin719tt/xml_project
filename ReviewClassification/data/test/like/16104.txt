Nicholas Sparkstakes a turn from his usual, sometimes sappy romance stories inThe Guardian: still a romance, this book has a definitive thriller edge to it. I enjoyedThe Guardianand think Sparks accomplished his objectives of mixing a romance with a thriller without losing sight of the relationship that was building throughout the novel.When Julie's husband dies in his early 20s, he leaves Julie with a note and a Great Dane puppy, who she names Singer, to look after her. Four years after becoming a young widow, Julie is ready to start making good on her late husband's wish that she find someone who makes her happy. She dates a few losers, gets romanced by some seemingly charming guys, and eventually falls in love with Mike, the man who was her husband's best friend. As their romance grows, they soon realize they are fighting for their lives against a violent stalker who is dead-set on having Julie for himself.True throughout to his guardian duties, Singer is the shining star of this novel. More human than dog, he is the only one who seems to know what's going on the whole time.I haven't read many Sparks novels, but I hear this one breaks form quite a bit. For that, I say kudos to Sparks! Job well done.
