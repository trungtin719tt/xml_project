"Look no farther than your hand, make a choice and take a stand"Miri is such a heroin! The type of character I really enjoy to read and a great role model to my daughter! She speaks out her mind, is brave, smart, always finds her way, she is just perfect!There is this 'Bachelor' idea in between the plot, that I wasn't attractive to and I also wasn't a fan of the age of the girls to get married because even though Sahnnon Hale has this amazing writing style that can transport to a past generation the novel is very recent.That been said, the real message of the book is EDUCATION, the importance of get our girls the education they deserve and how can educated woman can change the environment of their communities, I think that is a great message and I really appreciate.The father and daughter relationship was heart warming, I really love that new profile of a father, it was a difficult but honest and loving relationship.This story was a joy! Sadly I cannot keep reading this beautiful story because there is not an Spanish version! I read with my daughter so the English version is not an option...Setting: Asland &amp; Mount Eskel
