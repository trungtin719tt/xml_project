What a beautiful story."But she wasn't around, and that's the thing when your parents die, you feel like instead of going into every fight with backup, you are going into every fight alone."If this book doesn't make you want to hug your mom, then I honestly don't know what will.Chick's story is so powerful because ofhow honestly it portrays a mother-child relationship.Most of us have felt anger, embarrassment, and disappointment because of our mothers, and while that's normal, we sometimes forget that they're human too. They make mistakes, and so do we. In the end though, a mom's love for us is a bottomless pit."There's only your life, how you mess it up, and who is there to save you."The main thing I liked about this story is how hopeful and happy it made me. I lost a mother figure a couple of years ago and this didn't make me feel sad about the loss, but happy that I'd been able to have such an incredible person in my life.I'm so glad I ended up reading this.
