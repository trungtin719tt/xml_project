4.5 Stars. Can't classify this one as horror, but THE TALISMAN is one wild and woolly action-packed fantasy ride!"Traveling" Jack Sawyer is a good kid and 12 years old when he and his mother flee Los Angeles for New York ultimately ending up in an empty, creepy hotel in New Hampshire; and while Jack questions the moves, he knows deep down his mother is not well.As the days pass and his mother's rest periods become more frequent, a worrisome Jack explores a closed amusement park nearby and is soon befriended by a gnarly old black janitor...Lester Speedy Parker who tells him incredible stories of a parallel world and a magic juice that can transport him to a place where he can acquire the secrets ofTHE TALISMANand hopefully save his mother.His danger infested quest from east coast to west with flips from a world of evil doings and enslavement to one with bizarre creatures beyond your imagination has an unlikely friendship for Jack with a 6'5" Wolf that will break your heart.....it did mine.For me,THE TALISMANbrought back memories of King'sDark Towersseries, and while a chunkster at 700+ pages, entices me to re-read it in the form of a graphic novel so I can see the creeping tree roots, the evil abusive bar owner, the camp-school from hell, and visually experience the train ride through the "blasted land" as a scared, but brave young Jack Sawyer grows up fast to save his friends and mother and complete his mission.Entertaining and fun read with a young-adult feel to it.
