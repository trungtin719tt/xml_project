Completed a re-read of this marvelous book. It was a joy to be reacquainted with all the original characters. Pug, Tomas, Arutha, Amos, Jimmy the Hand, the family of the Shinzaiwai, Macros and the sacrifices he has to make.The book is rich with themes. Love, loyalty, duty, courage, all figure strongly in this amazing tale.I've recently begun reading the Book of the Fallen by Stephen Erikson (SK), and this book is very similar in themes. Although stylistically different, there is little of the back and forth banter that you can get with SK, the multi-level conflicts between characters of matching powers is common to both. Both writers have enormous and richly detailed worlds which are awesome to behold and seemless in execution.I rank these two writers at the top of what I've read, and I look forward to reading more books from each author in the near future.From my original review...I had the good fortune to discover and read this book in the early '80s when it first came out and I was hooked. If anyone asked me who my favourite author was for the next 30 years I could be relied upon to state "Raymond E. Feist." Whenever I saw a hard cover come out I would buy it - no questions asked.The adventures of Pug and Tomas and the many assorted characters of this world have been a true fascination for me and I am pleased to say that every second I spent reading these books was time well spent and I would be willing to bet that my view will be the same on my death bed.Long live heroic, epic fantasy - the truest form of story I have ever come across. When Feist passes on, Tolkien will welcome him into the next world as an equal and the two of them will swap stories over a fine brew and a pipe of the finest of the Shire.
