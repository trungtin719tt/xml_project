I DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO FUNCTION RIGHT NOW. I HAVE JUST READ THE MOST BRILLIANT AND HEART-RIPPING STORY OF THE UNIVERSE.How do I do words?! How do Iexplainhow much I'm feeling right now? I think I could cry and sing all at once, but mostly cry. Just know this very very truthful fact:This is the most incredible book I have read. It's probably my favourite contemporary in the world.I can't....I just...I need a moment.I love this book.You know how it's compared toEleanor &amp; ParkandThe Fault in Our Stars? Usually Ihategoing into a book with expectations like that, but for ONCE it was exceptionally incredibly totally spot-on. Well, cut out E&amp;P. It's nothing like that. It'severythinglike John Green's writing. Intelligent and emotional and energetic. I actually say (and trust me, I wouldnotbe saying this lightly) this is on par with my favourite John Green books. YEAH. I SAID IT, OKAY? DEAL.It's about mental illness and being a freak and being alone and having a best friend.Wow. Heavy topics. It gets a million stars for each. It's about a mental illness that I'll put in spoiler tags just here(view spoiler)[bipolar(hide spoiler)](not that it IS really a spoiler...but since the book doesn't tell you what exactly it is until the end, I figure you might want to go in blind. I did. I liked that I wasn't 100% sure). It creates this character, Finch, who is so live and real and spontaneous and unprecedented, I just...I just loved him. I felt a huge connection to Finch. It made the book so personal because I know people with mental illnesses and I suffer from some (though not the same as Finch's) myself and ... wow. Can we just give the author all the award of ever for writing it PERFECTLY? I want to cry. GAH! I'm reviewing, okay, okay, I'm reviewing.It's also about Violet, who's suffering from PTSD after losing her sister. Both Violet and Finch basically want to die, but then they don't want to die.Suicide is a huge theme in the book.I mean, the two meet on a tower were both were considering throwing themselves off. It does make me sad, though, that both kids really hid their feelings from adults/help because they thought nobody understood. That always makes me sad when I read that. IF YOU ARE SUFFERING FROM THINGS YOU CAN'T CONTROL: IT'S NOT YOUR FAULT. AND ASKING FOR HELP IS OKAY. Though this was addressed too. Eventually. Kind of?The writing is perfection.Violet and Finch take turns narrating and their voices are SO different. Incredible. Finch is like a ball of spontaneous energy but simultaneously crippling depression. Violet is discovering herself without her sister...and what even is the point of life? Their voices are raw. Their thoughts are so relatable.I only had half an issue with it.I felt the ending dragged a bit. I loved it. I didn'twantit to end, but at the same time I just felt like it was procrastinating. Little teeny bit not okay.BUT WHO EVEN CARES?! *throws flowers of sadness* I LOVED THE BOOK.But I have to warn you...it also hurts.Not in the "ouch, hate that" in the "I FREAKING CANNOT HANDLE THIS RIGHT NOW. STAHP. STAHP EVERYTHING AND JUST STAAAAAHP." More like that okay? I was nearly number. The characters are just so real, I felt like I was in the book.Also, I never do this, but I lost track of time. At one point I read for 2 hours straight without evennoticingI'd been reading that long. I...I never do that. I have a short attention span.So I don't know why you're still here. Um? Go. Go preorder or read this book orsomething.
