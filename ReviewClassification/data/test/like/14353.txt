I listened to the audio book version and really enjoyed it. I have a different standard for audio books (than I do for books I read myself in a printed format). They have to be read at a pace that allows me to understand what's being said (the actual words being read) and what's happening in the story while I'm driving my car, the voice of the reader has to be pleasant and agreeable and the story has to hold my attention. I'm generally able to suspend disbelief more easily when I'm listening to an audio book.I liked the characters Kate Morton created and loved the story, a woman trying to uncover the mystery of who she is and where she came from. I also loved the period of time that was covered. The story had dark and sinister facets and I would have liked it if they had been expanded upon a little more.This story captured my attention and held it through to the end. I liked the way the author slowly revealed parts of the past so the reader knows things the characters don't, I thought this added to the suspense of the story. The narration by different characters was not confusing when listening to the audio book because the reader did such a wonderful job of creating individual voices for each of them.
