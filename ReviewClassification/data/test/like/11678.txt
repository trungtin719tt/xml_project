I've read this book twice, and for a brief instant, when reading about event horizons, I got it. But don't ask me to explain it now.The book explains in lay terms what several decades ago was only understood by a handful of people. Surprisingly, it is not devoid of humour, and is actually very readable. The remarkable author leads the reader on a journey from the earliest premises of the ancient astronomers right up to black holes and white dwarves, and the latest thinking on the future of the universe. He appears to have escaped the vast egos that led the likes of Isaac Newton to discredit their rivals, and gives credit to the work of others where due. At a time when more information is available to more people than ever before, reading a book like this reminds you that understanding still requires effort, and that passive access to information is of only relative worth by itself. Priceless.
