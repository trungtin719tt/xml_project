"It is an Ancient MarinerAnd he stoppeth one of Three--'By thy long grey beard and twinkling* eye,Now wherefore stoppeth thou me?''There was a Ship...' 'Unhand me, Grey-beard loon!'"I recall aloudreading and memorizing this in Grammar School (no longer the Latin Grammar school Shakespeare attended), Grade Four to Eight, which? Tested on knowing maybe 40 lines--beginning, ending, and various passages in between. In fact, it grounded me in my adolescent loneliness: "this soul has been/ Alone on a wide wide sea. / So lonely 'twas that God himself / Scarce seemed there to be." From adolescent loneliness to religious doubt, all bound in simple measure.Of course, it had a Christian message, but also quite a bit of maritime knowledge-- the Albatross, " the Fair breeze blew, the white foam flew / The furrow followed free. / We were the first that ever burst / Into that silent sea." As well as plenty of poetic knowledge--here, medial caesura-rhyme, "blew" and "flew," "first" and "burst."Even an Hydrology message: "Water, water everywhere / And all the boards did shrink /Water, water everywhere, / Nor any drop to drink." A common problem for millionaires' shore cottages on Cape Cod estuarial swamps, where wells can fill with salt water.From his verse, one would never know Coleridge to be the most astute, intellectual English literary critic in history (along with TS Eliot). One would never know it from his simple-seeming, ballad-form story-telling. Both Wordsworth and Coleridge wrote in ballad form (as did the greatest of all poets, E. Dickinson), but Coleridge told a novella in it.Also, the Christian message at the end broadly diffuses as an Eco-environmental one: "He fareth well who loveth well / Both man and bird and beast. // He Fareth best who loveth best / All things both great and small / For the Dear God who loveth us, / He made and loveth all." (Another failing in the Humperty-Dumpster president's preparation-- never read Coleridge, a drop in the bay of unread books.)That should be an Ecological motto, Endangered Species, " All things both great and small" [He fareth best who loveth best...] Q.E.D. We are NOT FARING BEST.*From memory...oops, "glittering" eye
