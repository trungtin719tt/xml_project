At the time that I read this book I was an agnostic, pagan, ex-catholic, confused about religion person. Anne Rice's technique and passion is so persuasive that I was a true believer after reading this book. And this was before she converted back to Catholicism! She is just so powerful, her narrative technique is, I want to say, loving towards her reader. I think her love for the characters she's created makes that happen. Anyway, this one is a must for followers of the chronicles and fans of Lestat. My copy of this book is signed by the author and it was a pleasure to meet someone who's imagination was so unhampered that she could walk into the judeo-christian mythos with a vampire. I would say that this book forshadows her eventual work with the Jesus story.
