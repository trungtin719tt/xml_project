I love Bill Bryson's books, and this one is no exception. Bryson tells the story of his hiking up the Appalachian Trail (AT for short) with his friend, Stephen Katz. His friend is quite a character, and I sort of wonder if he is a real person, or if he is "invented". But--Katz is such a wonderful character, he is probably real, because "inventing" him would be nearly impossible. He is a recovering alcoholic, overweight sort of slob who throws out his irreplaceable supplies when the going gets tough. It seemed like a disaster in the making, but somehow Bryson and Katz survived.Bryson's prose is just a delight. He interleaves humorous anecdotes with tangents about history, the environment, bears, wildlife, and other interesting tidbits.The AT is not a simple "walk in the woods"--it is at times demanding, challenging, and very time consuming. It can take a great deal of preparation before setting off, and is definitely not for the weak-hearted. If nothing else, this book persuaded me not to try to hike the AT. But--I love the stories that Bryson tells along the way.I didn't read this book--I listened to it as an audiobook. Rob McQuay does a great job narrating, and I look forward to listening to other books that are read by him.
