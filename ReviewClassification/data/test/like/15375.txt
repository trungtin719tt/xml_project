Read immediately afterThe Paris Wife, this is like a book end on the 1920s in Paris, a photo of a writer's life in writing, as a husband and father, as a member of the ex-patriot community in Europe. There are glimpses of his writing process, his friendships (or maybe more properly relationships) with other writers, artists and luminaries large and small, his apparent love for his son and wife.All is masked as fiction but reads as real life. There are quotes upon quotes to mention."I thought of Miss Stein and Sherwood Anderson and egotismand mental laziness versus discipline and I thought who iscalling who a lost generation?" (p. 62)And this about moving to writing a novel:"I knew I must write a novel. But it seemed an impossiblething to do when I had been trying with great difficulty towrite paragraphs that would be the distillation of what madea novel. It was necessary to write longer stories now as youwould train for a longer race." (p. 71When he describes the lodge at Schruns, where he and Hadley spent several winters, even his writing style seems to change. He seems more generous and flowing."When we lived in Schruns I remember the long trip up thevalley to the inn where we slept before setting out on theclimb to the Madlener-Haus. It was a very beautiful old innand the wood of the walls of the room where you ate anddrank were silky with the years of polishing. So were thetables and chairs...You slept close together in the big bedunder the feather quilt with the window open and the starsclose and very bright." (p. 120)Of course that idyll eventually came to an end.There are so many moments in this book that are fascinating for so many different reasons--some are like watching a train wreck, some are like watching flowers bloom.Highly recommended whether you read Hemingway or not.
