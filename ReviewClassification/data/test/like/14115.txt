I am a die hard fan of three different series. Jim Butcher's Harry Dresden, Patricia Briggs' Mercy Thompson, and Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse are (in no particular order) my favorite characters to read about. I am now going to have to add Anita Blake to that list. Wow! I very rarely love the first book in any new series. I tend to cut them some slack though, because I know there is a lot of background info and world building that the author has to pack in to the first one. However, once I picked up Guilty Pleasures, I couldn't put it down! The whole book was action packed and totally engrossing. I haven't been this excited by a new book in a while, and I am looking forward to reading the next one!
