Despite the often dense and twirly prose, I enjoyed this novel immensely! It helped that I read this out of genuine interest, not forced by educators, nor pushed down my throat by anyone, which bode well for my enjoyment of the story for the story's sake. And it was good!At first, I was tempted to review this with a comparison to the famous 1992 film inspired by this book, which was my introduction to the story, but it'd be a long breakdown of what the film got wrong and why (the changes to Duncan Heyward and the Cora/Uncas romance are the biggest sins of the adaptation...!), which defeats the purpose of abookreview. Suffice to say that I'm glad it's very different. Personally, I like the original story much more, as the details are richer, despite the writing. There were gratifying surprises as well, particularly how subtle the feelings between the Mohican and the British are. Other surprises weren't as much, like Nathaniel, whom I'd expected to be different, and younger.Oh, and that my copy had illustrations by N. C. Wyeth, one of my favourite artists, was wonderful! A very nice accompaniment.
