When I first met Erika, for some long forgotten reason and situation, someone said, "Do you like my hat?"I answered: "No. I do not." There was an awkward pause and I added, "Good-bye. Good-bye again," with some totally bizarre, guttural, kiddie voice. It became a fun inside joke for Erika and me, but for the life of us, we couldn't remember where it came from. It sounded familiar; it didn't sound me-invented, but we couldn't place it.Then we had babes, and I picked up a bunch of board books -- and there it was."Hello!""Hello!""Do you like my hat?""I do not.""Good-by.""Good-by."It wasn't quite how I remembered it, not quite the way my mind had twisted it over all those years, but we had finally found the source, and we were stoked.5 years later my boy is reading it to me. It is a great book to foster reading , but even if I didn't have a prior bond with the book beyond learning to read, I would still loveGo Dog. Gobecause of my son.It is a fave. No question.
