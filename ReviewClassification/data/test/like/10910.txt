Margaret Atwood's The Blind Assassin is a fascinating and compelling read! There are so many seemingly competing stories which add to the complexity of the narrator and her life. They are also next to impossible to fully understand without the rest of the stories (as strange and disjointed as they sometimes appear). The result is that the reader stays somewhat lost until all the pieces fall into place. The novel begins with the death (apparently suicide) of the narrator's sister. This beginning section is engaging; however, the payoff for following all the story's threads comes much later in the narrative. By about the final 100 pages I was savoring the experience of discovery: how each story had always been purposeful and relevant all along. I'm a big fan of Margaret Atwood's works, but this is very different than anything I'd read before (like Handmaid's Tale or Oryx &amp; Crake). 4.5 stars rounded up. Very worthwhile!
