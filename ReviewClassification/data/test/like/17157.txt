Wow, WHAT a read! I can definitely see why this novel has been hailed an all-time pop culture classic! I loved absolutelyeveryminute of this book and I wish I could find more contemporary novels with the vim, wit, and insight that this book offered! This will always have a place on my shelf and will always be one of my all-time favorites! (Funny how my all-time favs this year have been classics rather than contemporaries, eh?) I highly recommend this book to all women, particularly those "coming of age" in their 20s-30s. You'll find something to love, empathize with and root for in all of these women!FOLLOW ME AT:The Navi Review Blog|Twitter|Instagram
