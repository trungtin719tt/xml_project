Jitterbug Perfume was the first Tom Robbins book I ever read, back in the spring of my freshman year of college in 1996 (thanks, Yanek!). I fell in love instantly. If you've never read a Robbins book before, I will warn that they are not for everyone - he likes to push the envelope when it comes to social pre-conceptions, religion, relationships, etc. - but if you tend to like weird, quirky, philosophical stories, you owe to yourself to give at least one of his books a try. This one focuses on themes of life and death and immortality, and the importance of our sense of smell throughout all of these. You meet the ancient Greek god Pan and by the end, you're dying to smell this amazing perfume discovered by our protagonists. It is a crazy romp through centuries and around the world, and I love every minute of it.
