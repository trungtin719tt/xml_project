Inspired. Chilling. Alarmingly realistic. Witty. Devastating. Dark. Empowering. Radical. Outstanding. Classic.Although I read and reviewed the novellaHerlandduring the autumn of last year it was indeed the title story inthiscollection which led me to the literary door ofCharlotte Perkins Gilman.I am not really very sure whether I would have prefered to have read these works first. I was beginning to feel a little ashamed at just how longThe Yellow Wallpaperhad been decorating my bookcase and so turned my attention towards the collection earlier this week since I was looking for a swift yet enriching read.My slender Dover Thrift edition ofThe Yellow Wallpapercontains seven short stories:The Yellow WallpaperThree ThanksgivingsThe CottagetteTurnedMaking a ChangeIf I Were a ManMr. Peebles' Heart'The Yellow Wallpaper' is certainly her masterpiece, however I adore and admire each of these stories, I covet the tone and texture and the complex layers of each distinctive narrative. The symbolism in 'The Yellow Wallpaper' is enthralling, horrifying, sublime; such a short, short story that when I had finished it I actually returned to page one and immersed myself into this terrifying yet oh-so-true tale of psychological ill-health all over again.Charlotte Perkins Gilman's unorthodox utopian feminism is brilliantly demonstrated in this collection. She explores the concept of 'madness', dips into some alternate realities, challenges gendered identities and through a feminist lens she raises questions and creatively explores issues of class and power.Charming tales. Intelligent literature. Highly recommended.
