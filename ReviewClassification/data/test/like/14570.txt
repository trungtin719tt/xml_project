Pre Review:If Alex doesn't make it...then my heart will implode. I really hope that Pandemonium has the following or I'm not sure I'd make it through this book:-Alex is alive, in prison, and not "cured" (because no one better touch a hair on his head!!!)-Lena WAITS for him, gets stronger, and *drum roll* rescues him-Lena doesn't fall in love with some other dude with pretty eyes and kissable lips or I'd SOS him.(Shoot on Sight)So the book is coming out February 28 and I preordered my copy!!!!Post Review:Oh lord...coming soon.
