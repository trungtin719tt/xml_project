Odd Thomas is a young, short order cook with special psychic abilities. When a stranger arrives in the town of Pico Mundo, Odd notes a upsurge of other worldly 'bodachs' and knows that something horrific is about to happen. Using his abilities, he must now figure out what it is and how he can stop it.This is the first Koontz novel I've read for several years and whilst it took me a while to get through it I found it really enjoyable. Odd is a charmingly peculiar character, a good man who wants to always do the right thing. The supporting characters all felt very well fleshed out and added a lot to the overall story.The story is fairly straight forward with some satisfying twists and turns, whilst this wasn't an extremely fast read for me this was more to do with my reading habits then anything wrong with the story.Nicely paced with a likeable protagonist, I would recommend this for those that like paranormal thrillers.
