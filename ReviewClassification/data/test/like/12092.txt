'What did it matter where you lay once you were dead? In a dirty sump or in a marble tower on top of a high hill? You were dead, you were sleeping the big sleep, you were not bothered by things like that...You just slept the big sleep, not caring about the nastiness of how you died or where you fell. Me, I was part of the nastiness now.'So concludes Philip Marlowe at the end of this case. I'm really glad I didn't know the story beforehand, having never watched the movie. I didn't see whodunnit until the very end.Fabulous original crime noir novel where no one is ever really innocent and every one has secrets to hide... I loved the style of writing and could have quoted from almost every page. Marlowe is an honest-ish , hard boiled gum shoe , fast-off-the-trigger-with-those-wisecracks, who's been around the block a few times. Foxy dames, chain smoking, cyanide, blackmail, extortion, murder, insanity. What more can you ask for?Fabulous!
