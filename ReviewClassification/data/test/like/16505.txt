This is the kind of story I live for. When I run across one, I read it slowly, savor every moment, dreading the thought if it coming to an end. It's a quest, it's a survival against great odds, it's a woman growing up long past the time she became an adult. It's about someone coming to their senses and finding out who they are and what they want. As others have said, what a movie. But a movie would have to get inside the head of Mrs. Warner, hear her talk to herself as she faces each brink of a moment. I think of myself as Mrs. Warner now. I say: what would Mrs. Warner who slowly grows younger and fitter and wiser and kinder and less needy and more self-reliant until she becomes the girl she was, Molly Brock. I like to think I too have become my Molly Brock. Great book!
