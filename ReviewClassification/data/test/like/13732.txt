Sparse prose is sexy.Sexy.And that's why I've given it a special shelf on my page, calleda buck and change.Guess what else sparse prose is?Rare.That's why I have only seven books on there.Why? Why are these precious books that fall under 200 pages so rare?Because writers tend to overwrite everything.But not Edith Wharton, the queen of sparse prose. And Ms. Wharton, though she may appear stolid in her old black and white portraits, was one sexy lady.She manages inEthan Frometo take one anti-hero, one untamed shrew, and one manipulative maiden, and proves, in less than 100 pages, that winter, isolation and poverty do not discriminate.Wharton is never a sell-out. She gives you foreshadowing, symbolism and metaphors in just the right dosages, and she never wastes your time.And when one red dish shatters into sharp pieces all over that never-ending landscape of white. . . you can not help but be bewildered at what an exceptional writer can do, especially in succinct and clever prose.
