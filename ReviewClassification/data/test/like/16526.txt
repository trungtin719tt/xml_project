Hands down the best Faulkner I've read yet. Faulkner touches on alot of themes. This was an intense book that was hard to put down. I guess I would say I'm a plot junky and Faulkner delivered but he also presented some fascinating and diverse characters. To date, this is the easiest Faulkner I've read and it starts out strong, never lags and ends strong. 5 stars no doubt and it's added to my favorite shelf.
