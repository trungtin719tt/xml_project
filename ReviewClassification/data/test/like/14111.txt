Anita Blake is a professional Badass who raises zombies, slays vampires, and quotes Dr. Seus. What more could you want?The vampires in this book are not nice. They are voracious, sexy, and dangerous. They are fascinating. The writing is snappy and fast-paced, the characters perfectly imperfect and full of personality. So, yeah, this was a pretty good book.I remember binge-reading my way through several Anita Blake books a few years ago, so this was a reread, but it was just as good as I remembered. Hamilton has a writing style that makes things feel high-stakes and makes me want to tear through the pages. Back when I first met Anita Blake, I remember dropping the series when I couldn't find the next book in my library, and(view spoiler)[when I felt the sex scenes took over the plot.(hide spoiler)]I hope I was young and naive back then, because I really want the rest of the series to be as good as this book.
