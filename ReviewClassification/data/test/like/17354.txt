It was our graduation practice yesterday and we had nothing to do so I decided to borrow a book from my classmate. I immediately started reading the book when he handed it to me.One thing I realized from this book is how a mother's love can be the purest form of love there is. I realized that no matter how you feel that you are often misunderstood by your mom, she is the person who, of all persons, can understand you no matter what happens.I also learned about the sacrifices that they make just for us to be happy. Even though sometimes, what they think would make us happy actually does the opposite, it is STILL the thought that counts.I am not a perfect daughter, in fact, I may be one of the worst daughters you would ever meet in your life. That's why I was really touched by this book.And the one thing I told myself after reading this book is that I will never be ashamed of my mother. No matter how old we get. I will not ask her to leave or I will not push her away when she tries to kiss me in front of my friends.I finished this book that same day and I seriously cried my heart out when I was done with it. I don't know but Mitch Albom has this certain magic in the way he writes.I hope you can read it too.
