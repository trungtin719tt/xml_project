Bulgarian review:https://bookishipster.wordpress.com/2...The second book in the 'Perfect Chemistry' trilogy was just as lovely as the first one. Even though Carlos was a bit annoying at first and a little bit different than his brother, i still enjoyed 'Rules of Attraction' very much. I liked Carlos and Kiara's relationship, they had some really cute moments and i loved the family atmosphere in this book. It was nothing special, but still really cute and lovely.
