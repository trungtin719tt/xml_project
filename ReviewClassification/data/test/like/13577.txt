I rounded up this rating because for me is more like a 3.8, this amazing journey aboard the Nautilus is an incredible voyage, having read this more than a hundred years after it was written is an other kind of ride, it is fairly amazing how much became a reality after the imagination and research of Jules Verne, you have to keep in mind that this story develops way before this kind of tech exist and more ignorant of the life that habits the ocean even more than today, I enjoyed this book but it was also kind of slow and descriptive of somethings we know don't work like described, a entertained tale and a classic one to be still enjoyed.
