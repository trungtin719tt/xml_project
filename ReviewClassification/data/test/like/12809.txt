One of those books that gets a five on principle. I don't feel that Borges' entire bibliography is worth five stars on a story-by-story or book-by-book basis, but that's got more to do with the fact that nobody's is (and the factLa memoria de Shakespearethat is mostly Borges retreadingThe Book of Sand-era Borges - "August 25, 1983" reminds me too much of "The Other," and "Blue Tigers" swipes its central concept from "The Book of Sand" - the title story is amazing, but the rest is worth skipping) than anything else. Besides, there's something about having every single Borges short to make it into his seven collections in a single book. That's over a hundred stories, of which around fifty are terrific even by Borges' standards and a further... oh, forty, we'll say? blow pretty much everything else out of the water. In the three or so weeks I spent reading this, it came to vie withInfinite Jestas my number-one desert island book.The individual collections all have a lot of character, which is why I rated them individually in addition to lump-rating them here. But reading them as a whole gives you a sense of how capable Borges was of working with his favorite themes, symbols, and images - memory, ancestry, immortality, dreams, mirrors, knife fights, the South, and of course, the labyrinth. These cut across the hit-or-miss biographical sketches inA Universal History of Iniquity;Ficciones, perhaps the most overtly philosophical of Borges' works; the globe-trottingThe Aleph and Other Stories, which furthers the argument from the famous "Two Kings and Their Two Labyrinths" that there's no better place to get lost in than the wide-open world; the deeply personal sketches ofDreamtigers; the surprising realism ofBrodie's Report; the nostalgia and mortality ofThe Book of Sand; hell, evenLa memoria de Shakespeareis all sorts of reflective. Themes of death would come up in Borges' later poetry (some of which is as good as his best short stories), but the preoccupation of it on the Book of Sand makes it one of Borges' most lingering and unjustly overlooked works. See, this is what these sorts of compilations are for.I do have one complaint, though: the handling ofDreamtigers, a prose-poetry Frankenstein. I get that this is the collectedFiccionces, butSelected Poemscontains both the short stories and the poems that make up that minor classic, where this contains only the stories. I hope later editions of that book rectifies the mistake, because the book just doesn't have the same impact presented as a strictly prose work. Minor quibble, though. The simple fact that this book exists is cause for celebration. You should read it sometime.
