Feb 28 ~~ Beautiful, just beautiful. Proper review tomorrow.Mar 2 ~~ I used to see Pilcher's books everywhere: at the library, in used book sales, at garage sales. But I was never interested in them, simply because the covers always made me think they would not be my cup of tea. Considering the wide range of books I have always read, that seems like a funny thing to say, but there it is: I never stopped to look beyond the covers.Then a few years ago I saw a review by a GR friend of mine who had just read her first Pilcher, and it was this very book. She had pretty much the same story i had, about seeing the covers and thinking the books would not be for her. Then she read The Shell Seekers and wondered how she could have ignored this author for so many years.I said to myself 'Well, if Candi liked it, I'm sure I will too.' and I made a mental note to try at least this book someday. I was in Mexico at that time, so did not see any copies anywhere and didn't order any, thinking that I would find one or two someday while up here visiting. Then life took one its usual turns and here I am full time in Arizona again, and one of the first things I thought when i got a bit more settled was 'Off to the library to borrow a Pilcher!'And they did not have a single solitary copy of any of her books.Once I got over my shock (how could they have four shelves full of James Patterson and not even one title by Rosamunde Pilcher?!) I ordered The Shell Seekers and as soon as I could after it arrived I dove in, barely coming up for air at all during the whole process.I loved it! But I know I would not have appreciated it nearly as much if i had read it earlier in life, so the timing was perfect. Penelope, the delightful main character, is in her early sixties and with a dodgy heart. She has three children, only one of whom is anywhere close to decent and even she is not as awesome as her mom. The children all want to interfere and tell Mum how to live now that she is 'old and frail'. I became very protective of Penelope during my reading, and I worried that she would not see the reality behind the so-called concern. But Penelope was no fool; she was a wise woman with no illusions about her offspring and their characters. And she handled things wonderfully, right to the very end.I was captivated by the writing, by the effortless way Pilcher told her story, blending the past and the present and slowly presenting a special life, an unforgettable life. I cried at the end (and at a few other places here and there) and I felt as though I wanted to go back to page one and start all over again.Instead I went back to my favorite online used book seller and ordered another Pilcher. The heck with that silly budget! Forget about limited shelf space! I wanted more!Thanks again to GR friend Candi, who planted the Pilcher seed in my little pea brain. Looks like it will turn into quite a garden. LOL
