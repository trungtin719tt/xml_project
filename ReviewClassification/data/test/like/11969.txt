Terrifying.I have read two books that described a nightmare, painted a picture of hell. The second wasBlood Meridian, or the Evening Redness in the Westby Cormac McCarthy and first is Night.I still think of this book sometimes and shudder and I realize that evil is never too far buried in us. The scene where the line of doomed prisoners splits in two with Mengela conducting, a perverse parody of the last judgment seems ripped from Dante.
