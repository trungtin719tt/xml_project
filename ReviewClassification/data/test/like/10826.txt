The wise warrior avoids the battle.I can't think in a better quote to begin this review.Sometimes, reading books about war tactics or novels of the genre of war, is confused with glorify wars, destruction, death and all sad things that are results of a war. But, at least, in my case (I can't speak for others) it's not that. I don't glorify war. One of my favorite historical subjects is World War II, but it's not because an insane instinct of glorify war. I just support the concept that any person who forget the past or don't doing anything to learn about the past, he/she will be cursed to repeat history.The supreme art of war is to subdue the enemy without fighting.In the case of this particular book,The Art of War, besides the obvious reading by people in military careers, it's a recommended lecture to people in areas such as business, in special for management, and certainly you can apply many of the lessons of the book to almost any field of interaction with others where a "victory" is involved.All warfare is based on deception.Without deception, the WWII couldn't be won, since while the real invading forces of D-Day were arriving to Normandy's beaches, the core of Nazi's forces were in other place falling to false messages and even a false settlement with even fake tanks that in pictures taken from the air looked like the real deal.There is no instance of a nation benefitting from prolonged warfare.Hard lessons about this can be learn from the conflict in Vietnam, just to name the quickest example that came to my mind.So in war, the way is to avoid what is strong, and strike at what is weak.Giving a rest to the horrors of real wars, this lesson is an interesting explanation of why adventure stories are always so captivating. Since, you never saw a "hero" facing a weak opponent. In real life is quite wise and logical to do it, but in fictional literature? Oh, you always read about the underdog battling against the odds and fighting a very stronger enemy. I guess that sometimes logic can be boring against the excitement of tall challenges.There are five dangerous faults which may affect a general:(1) Recklessness, which leads to destruction;(2) cowardice, which leads to capture;(3) a hasty temper, which can be provoked by insults;(4) a delicacy of honor which is sensitive to shame;(5) over-solicitude for his men, which exposes him to worry and trouble.Easily this can be the fragment that I liked the most to read in this book, since after reading it, well, my first thought was about Captain Jean-Luc Picard fromStar Trek: The Next Generation, since in fiction, usually almost any leading character hardly will fall to the fault #2, but many times, for the sake of excitement and showing daring scenes, some leaders are faulty to one of more than one of those mentioned faults. Again, the conflict between practical logic against excitement.A good example of lessons about war and leadership can be seen in the recent filmDawn of the Planet of the Apeswhere in a film industry willing to give as much warfare and destruction without delay for the sake of selling tickets, in this movie, you can watch to "Caesar", the leader of the rising Ape community and his struggles to avoid war at all costs since he knows well how hard and costly can be the losses of any war, not matter if you resulted in the "victorious" one.Sadly, wars is part of the humankind, since I think that even in those so-called "peace times", always, in some place, in a small scale or in a bigger scale, there has been a war. So, learning how to avoid a war, and if you have to do it, learning how to carry it out with the fewer loss of human lives (of both sides of the conflict), always is a relevant topic.
