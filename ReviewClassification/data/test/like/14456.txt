I love Stephen King. I'm not IN love with him, but I love his writing, his stories, his characters, and now, his advice: "Read a lot." (4-6 hours a day, even!)Yessir, Mr. King! Finally some advice I want to heed! OK, I should say that this is really only a small fraction of the wisdom he imparts in this book, and I neglectfully left out the "write a lot" part that immediately follows "read a lot".But I have never actually aspired to be a writer, so the reading part is good enough for me. I admire writers, sure, some more than others, but I've never thought about writing something of my own. I never really had any ideas, and if I did, I never had any follow-through on them, so they just kind of withered and died. I did take creative writing in highschool, but that doesn't count.But here we have a revelation of sorts. Writing doesn't have to be so stiff and planned anddiagrammed! I always knew that King had a kind of "organic" (gosh, how cliche that word is becoming these days) writing style - he'd let the characters be themselves and come to life on their own, and let events develop based on these characters, and just see where the story takes him. Sure, I knew that, academically. But I still rather thought that he had a kind of road-map in his head for which direction things would go, and that he filled in the details along the way. Point A to Point B to Point C to Destination D.It's rather inspiring to know that's not how he does it, and that his method WORKS. Because it does work. My highschool creative writing teacher would probably cry herself to sleep every night if she knew. She of the "Plot Diagramming Is Key!" mentality.I really enjoyed the way that this book was written. It didn't feel much like reading. Most of the time, it seemed as if I was having a one-on-one with Steve himself, and he was telling his tale and giving his advice to me alone.I also felt like this, as well as Lisey's Story, is a kind of tribute to Tabitha King, for all the ways that she kept him afloat through the years. It was a little like peeking through the window into their lives. I could see their college days, their trailer with two small babies days, their slightly bigger but still small apartment with two small kids days, their big-break day. I could see the beer cans stacking up in the bin, and the drug-covered floor in the intervention. When King described his various workstations, I could see them clearly in my mind, even though he'd give us only the barest description... but then again, it's a white rabbit with a blue 8. His description of his accident, and the aftermath especially, brought tears to my eyes because, even though I knew how close the world was to losing him that day, I didn't reallyKNOWuntil he showed me.I read this in one sitting, which is a testament to King's readability, as I am not by nature a non-fiction reader. He just somehow makes stuff, life, interesting. Even something as seemingly mundane (even to a reader) as grammar rules, he makes it interesting. His personality and sense of humor shine throughout the book and lent it a personal feeling that other grammar and writing texts lack. Man, I wish I could have had him as a teacher. Those lucky bastards. I hope they appreciated every red mark he ever scribbled on their work.King loves to write. That's obvious. He's a gajillionaire and needs never work another day in his life, but he still writes. This makes me happy, because I can't imagine never reading another new Stephen King book. The day he is no longer able to write will be a tragic day indeed. But, hopefully that day will be very long in coming, and King will continue to do what he does best: Tell us stories. :)
