I don't think words can properly describe how much I adored SHADOW &amp; BONE. The characters, the world-building...it completely blew me away. There were moments when I was so stunned by the beauty and the brilliance that I had to stop reading. I never wanted this book to end.This is the best YA fantasy novel I've read since SABRIEL or THE GOLDEN COMPASS.
