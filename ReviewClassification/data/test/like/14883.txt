Well, scratch the Appalachian Trail off my bucketlist.Bryson sets off to walk the Appalachian trail with only anextremely overpriced backpack(packed with equally ridiculously expensive gear), anold "friend"that he hadn't talked to in years and a will to findhis next story. He quickly realized that the months of preparation he conducted (and the lack of months his friend prepared) were notnearly adequate. But on the plus side, he certainly found his story.As always, I absolutely enjoyed his signature sense of humor. Despite wandering around half crazed with fatigue, he still took the time to pen his quirky musings:Hunters will tell you that a moose is a wily and ferocious forest creature. Nonsense. A moose is a cow drawn by a three-year-old.Joking aside,this is a brutal trail(no matter whatCherylfromWildmay say. Her little pot-shots against The Appalachian Trail were not justified). Thesheer willpowerit takes to slog through ten to twenty trail miles a day simply boggles my mind.Distance changes utterly when you take the world on foot. A mile becomes a long way, two miles literally considerable, ten miles whopping, fifty miles at the very limits of conception.I was weary just reading it - and he already most of the monotonous bits from his story. I appreciate how reading this allowed me to adventure vicariously and decide (most definitely) that I will never hike such a trail.Even part of it.I'm not touching that thing with a ten-foot poleI'll stick to mywood-chipped half-mile pathsin the local park, thank you very much.Audiobook Comments---Am a smidge annoyed that he did not narrate his own autobiography (well micro-autobiography of a trail adventure (are micro-autos a thing?))---Narrator (Rob McQuay) was great though. No complaints other than it wasn't Bryson.Blog|Instagram|Twitter
