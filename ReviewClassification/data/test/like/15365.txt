Re-read September 2016It's been 8 years since I first readThe Dark Towerseries and I was impressed by how little I remembered. What I never forgot though, was how it made me feel and there was no difference in that the second time round. The last installment of the series is full to the brim with all kinds of sentiments and mostly an overwhelming sense of the approaching end. It's known from the start that the mission to enter the Tower is Roland's alone but knowing doesn't make it the least bit easier when members of the ka-tet start dying. And that's as hard to read as it is to write, I bet.It's a fact that nowadays, series keep running and running stretching indefinitely. (Have I mentioned how much I hate this sign of our times?) That sure keeps the money flowing but it also relieves the writers from the hard task of giving an end to their stories. As King says, endings are merciless. An ending is a closed door which no man can open. It is just another way to say goodbye. I may as well add that the greater a story is, the more painful the ending will be and this is no exception. Uncle Stevie fulfills his task of getting Roland to the Tower (this isn't a spoiler), while at the same time wrapping up pretty much every other loose end. He could leave it at that and we'd still be talking about a complete work, but no. After the heartbraking chapter titled"Susannah in New York", King invites the readers to close the book and not read any further. But who are we kidding? We're dying to know what's inside the Tower. Just like Roland, in a way. And we had it coming.The definitive ending gives a whole different essence to the whole series. Suddenly, all we thought we knew about Roland's journey, everything we gradually found out as the story advanced through all seven books, is crumbled to the ground. It is something that exceeds all expectations and even the wildest fantasies, yet in a subtle and vague way, it's like we knew it all along. In my opinion, it's the perfect ending and how great an accomplishment it is to give the perfect ending to such a big and complex story!As for King's involvement, it serves for the notion of "the story transcending its creator" to become clear and a vital part of the series. I found it truely inventive and, simply put, fucking awesome, if a bit balancing between modesty and masturbation. Pretty understandably, though, opinions will differ.What I consider a flaw was the pointless and easy ending of Walter after being a basic character in the first books, as well as the role of Mordred which was actually... none, other than brutally kill one of the tet's members before Roland annoyingly easily sends him to meet his mother. Perhaps the most uninteresting and useless villain in the history of literature. And to think a whole book was spent to describe his coming to life... it's aggravating!To summarize, I truely think thatThe Dark Toweris the best in its category in the last quarter of the 20th century. It's complex and multi-layered combining many elements and resulting to be a magnificent work of literature. Perfect? What story is perfect? The point for a story is not to be perfect butpowerful,tightandtrueand King's magnum opus is all three of them. Although pure fantasy, it allows the reader to relate not only to the heroes, but also to the actual story. Roland's quest to enter the Tower is deeply and utterly personal as it turns out, and so is the story itself to its readers. Andthat, my fellow readers, issuccess.
