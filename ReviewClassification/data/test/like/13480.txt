Holy sh*t! What an amazing book! I've had nervous knots in my stomach and have bitten down all my nails over the last three hours. What a fabulous second book! Can't wait for the final book.Reflected in You is the second book in the Crossfire Series, the first being Bared to You. These books have been compared to Fifty Shades, but they are one thousand times better than those books. You still get the sexy screwed-up billionaire alpha male who comes off as so controlling it borders on stalking. However, the heroine is no meek child. Eva is just as screwed-up as Gideon and she's also wealthy. These books are about two damaged people who enter a dysfunctional relationship and work as hard as they can to make it a functional one. The first book set up their story and this book was more about Eva's past history. The story was beautiful as sacrifices are made and they love each other unconditionally. I haven't stopped thinking about the book since I read it a few days ago and I'm even thinking of re-reading it. For those fans of Fifty Shades, this is a do not miss. It doesn't have the BDSM, but still contains plenty of hot sex which Sylvia Day writes to perfection. Once you read the first two in this series, the author has several historical romances and paranormal romances with spice to hold you over until the final book in this trilogy.
