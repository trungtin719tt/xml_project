What style! Holy Moses! Chandler writes with a purpose: to put you right in the shit. InThe Big Sleephe writes with the economy of biting words that surrounds Philip Marlowe, a detective whose seen the hardbitten world, with the street's lexicon.Hardboiled? Certainly. But I've read some hardboiled stuff that was boiled down to a tasteless mass. This stuff's full of flavor, bitter and sometimes bittersweet.You've seen the movie, now read the book. They're similar in style, but the story differs enough to make each quite enjoyable on its own.I was urged to read Chandler by a Goodreads friend or two, and boy I'm glad I did. However, since this is my first go 'round I'm going to close the dam on this review.The Big Sleephas a twisty, complicated plot and Chandler's writing is good enough that both deserve further reading to give them their due.
