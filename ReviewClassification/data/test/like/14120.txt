A great writer William Faulkner was winner of the Nobel Prize , yet not an easy read....This novel the name comes from the Bible, could be his best shows this. Seemingly just another southern Gothic book with erratic flashback after flashback revealing the truth ...layer by layer maybe, set both before and after the American Civil War 1861-1865, North against South... (620,000 soldiers died ), with different characters narrating the confusing story of Thomas Sutpen. A dirt poor man from what will become West Virginia leaving his family at 14, traveling to find a better life walking mostly across southern states and arriving in the fictional sleepy hamlet of Jefferson, Mississippi in 1833 at the age of 25. Not welcomed by the local population, trust never is given to the aloof stranger doesn't matter to the ambitious man wealth does, that is all to him. Mr. Sutpen is tired of poverty nothing can stand between his goal of riches even if a few get hurt... Somehow buying (stealing) a hundred square miles of Indian land "Sutpen's Hundred," his plantation. Having a few slaves he builds a large mansion but no furniture or windows money has gone, years later he does have and marries Ellen Coldfield , daughter of his only friend Goodhue Coldfield a small shop owner. Love match it is not, he wants respectability, she a big house to run and impress the town still there are secrets never talked about by decent people. Born to the unhappy couple are Henry and younger sister by two years Judith, crimes are committed by this family. Henry attends the new University of Mississippi at Oxford, later to be called ironically Ole Miss and meets Charles Bon, a few years older from New Orleans, becomes his best friend, nonetheless he is connected somehow to him. Taking Charles back home to Jefferson, he soon becomes unofficially engaged to Judith. This makes the mother Ellen ecstatic , Thomas her father isn't...why? The future couple strangely are quite calm, there must be a reason. But first war begins a glorious adventure for the young, cheers, congratulations naturally Henry and Charles join and battle together... disillusionment succeeded it. The old patriarch Thomas is made a Colonel in the rebel army too, fighting very bravely he never lacked courage not one of his many sins... This book will bore some, even irritate others but there is no denying its magnificence for those willing to read it.
