Before I read the bookAnyone else agree that after this she should write a third book about the youngest Fuentes, Luis?-----------------------------------------------------Yay, she is writing another book about Luis!-----------------------------------------------------Review Time(I like to give pointers on how I like my reviews to be read in brackets, feel free to ignore my suggestions)Aaahhh, my Fuentes boys, could youbeanymore perfect? (Yes, I am referencing Chandler). Perhaps it is alittlebit formulaic,but, its a very nice formula, isn't it? (channelling Salad fingers here, aaahhh, rusty spoons). As you can see above, I am really looking forward to Chain Reaction (awesome name),and, this time it will be Luis reforming a bad girl!, nice huh?I really loved how Alex and Brittany were in this, best couple ever, but I also thought the relationship between the brothers was amazing. Unlike Alex, Carloswantsto be a tough gang member, just like Alex was, but misses the point that Alex did it to protect him and Luis. He gets to discover what he really wants though, and it is very, very sweet (emphasis on the very's please, too lazy for italics). Epilogue is, well, EPIC!, less cheesy than the first book. My only problem is that this one isn't quite as funny as the first, ah well, can't have it every way.
