In my daily life, I talk about suffering a lot. I have had trouble accepting the fact that terrible things happen to people everyday, that the voiceless, the weak have to undergo great cruelty everywhere.Campbell says, for our sake we have to affirm the brutality, the thoughtlessness of our surroundings too. By doing so, we affirm our world and the experience of eternity here.I once mentioned to an older friend, if our world were to be a circle and we the dots to complete it, then our existence must be of utmost importance. The circle would remain incomplete without only one of us! I understand now that I was very naive. Anyone can be easily replaced. But the idea that I carry the stories of my ancestors, that my behavior is very much influenced by their way of life and that my manners, habits, doings are to an extent what they passed down, makes me less 'alone' and recognize this life to be more profound that I imagined.Campbell likens us to'One little microbit in that great magnitude'. And he talks about'following one's bliss'a lot.A few days ago, a distant relative of mine almost convinced me to study a certain subject of apparently great market value. She talked about future a lot. And about money. So, I was considering her words and harboring doubts about myself, about my decisions until I read this book.Who would I be if I don't 'follow my bliss'? If I don't hang on to what I love? I would be anything but myself and that's a kind of death too.Campbell says, we are partaking in something greater than us, than we can even grasp. That makes our experience here very humbling.I didn't fully understand him though. I should have read his earlier works first in order to understand his jargon. I guess, I'll read this book again in a year.Campbell's works resonate to this day. His insights greatly help explain our current culture. Reading this book was truly an enlightening experience for me.
