If I could I would give this audio book 6 stars. I loved everything about it. As always the narrator, Davina Porter, is amazing - I still can't believe that one person can do so many voices and accents. This is my favorite book in the series so far. The writing felt more focused, and all the events felt connected, which is not the case in some of the other Outlander books. There were loads of twists and turns, and I was continually on the edge of my seat. It was interesting to see the characters mature and change, especially Ian, Briana and Roger. As always I enjoyed the humour throughout the book, but I also shed a few tears this time round, and developed deeper feelings for some of the characters because of what they were going through. I've never read/listened to other books on the American revolution, so I'm also fascinated by the historical element in the story. I really recommend that you listen rather than read this series, as it's one of the best audible experiences out there.
