To the characters in this book I say:This was an intriguing story from the queen of unlikable characters. Lots of twists and turns. Lots of "ew, gross" moments. Lots of "He/She did WHAT!?"My only complaint would be that the story is 5 stars, but for me the payoff was only 3 stars.If you like dark tales, mysteries, characters you love to hate, other Gillian Flynn novels, give this one a try. You won't be disappointed!
