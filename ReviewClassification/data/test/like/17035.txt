Tim Butcher may have been a journalist, but what he really wanted to be was a historian. You can see it in his preparation, interests, and research (including the use of social history to fill out his knowledge), which he deftly melds with travel reporting and memoir as he explores the life and impact of Gavro Princip, whose assassination of Franz Ferdinand helped usher the world into war, and future reverberations that tore Yugoslavia apart, led to thousands of civilian deaths perpetrated by neighbors along ethnic lines, and continues to have an impact worldwide even today. He calls out the thugs, but also correctly points out factors that lead some to take up arms. He doesn't do happy, lighthearted travel, no. He liked traipsing through traumatized regions (Bosnia, Serbia, Congo) seeking out truths and exploring areas not often part of travel literature, while also tying his personal experiences into the whole. I know so much more about this area now, one I didn't think to visit before.
