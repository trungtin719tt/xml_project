Damn, the BDB series just keeps getting better and better. I really liked Ehlena and Rehv in this book. They are absolutely perfect for one another. I also loved that we got to see a bit more of Wrath and Beth. And of course, Xhex and John, although it is quite sad what happens to them in the book.The plot again is crazy! There are so many twists and turns that I swear my head would fall off. The writing is incredible. Ward makes me so envious! I seriously cannot wait to find out what happens to John Matthew and Xhex in Lover Mine. John may possibly be my favourite Brother. I. cannot. wait.Favourite Quote:The staircase that was revealed was lit with a soft red glow. "I feel like I'm walking down into a porn movie," V muttered as they took the steps with care."Wouldn't that require more black candles for you," Zsadist cracked. At the bottom of the landing, they looked left and right down a corridor carved out of stone, seeing row after row of...black candles with ruby color flames."I take that back," Z said, eyeing the display."We start hearing chick-a-wow-wow shit," V cut in, "Can I start calling you Z-packed?""Not if you want to keep breathing."2011 REREAD-APRIL
