Reading a Pat Conroy book takes a good long while,and this one was over 600 pages.Before this I had read The Prince of Tides which was terrific.Also,The Great Santini which had moments of brilliance.Beach Music requires perseverance.There are quite a few characters and quite a few stories,which are intense,dramatic and gripping.It has its share of graphic violence and some pretty dark moments.It could have been shorter,but is a memorable book,nevertheless.
