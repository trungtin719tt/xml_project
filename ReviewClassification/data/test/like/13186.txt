27/4/2017Trigger warning: kidnapping and murder (Chloe sees a death echo of a teenage girl)Is this trilogy now slightly dated as far as YA is concerned? Yes. Does this book end on a monumentally annoying cliffhanger? Yuh huh. Do I still really enjoy the characters and the world and getting to see Chloe struggle through using her powers? Definitely.I like the changing dynamic between Chloe and Derek (although I do wish he'd stop grabbing her arm EVERY SECOND DAMN PAGE), I like how they help each other through the troublesome part of their powers. The story is pretty fast paced, and the addition of the mutts definitely adds something for readers of the Women of the Otherworld series.1/1/2012As I said in my review of The Summoning, I've read this series about half a dozen times now. I read this in about three hours this afternoon. While I find it slightly hard to believe that Chloe would be able to deal with running away as well as she does, it's kind of exciting to discover the extent of her powers.
