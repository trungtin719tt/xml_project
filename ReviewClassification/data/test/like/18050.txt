The world portrayed in The Tin Drum is brutal and harsh, and, at the same time freakishly strange. There is an aspect to violence that disconnects from everyday reality. In this book, seen through the eyes of its diminutive hero, it becomes downright surreal. Though the tone may be fantastic, Grass does a better job of capturing life under Nazi rule than anything else I have ever read. Even in translation, his language is dazzling, and one thing is certain: after reading what happens at the end of the dock, you will never, ever look at eels the same way again.I read this book many years ago, but I am still thinking about it. That is one of the hallmarks of a great book. Even though I am the Liz Taylor of book reviewers, (I fall in love with and feel I have to marry {give five stars to} every man {book} I meet {read}), this is the very rare book to which I would beg to give six stars.
