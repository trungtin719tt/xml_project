I guess the thing that sets this retelling apart from the story as we know it (I mean the 18th century version, not the Disney one) is the charming first-person narrative (of which I have nothing to complain, which is rare) and the relationship between the sisters - and I loved there was true friendship and affection.Beauty, whose name is actually Honour, is the kind of girl you and I would like in real life. She values knowledge more than anything in the world, apart from people, nature and common sense - precisely as we would dose it. Delicate yet stubborn, she makes her way, as the story tells us, to the castle of the Beast and through the core of the enchantments that surround that place. I feel that I should talk about the magic in this book, how the enchantments seem almost palpable.But it was short, too short for me. I needed subplots, I needed some heroic rescuing. But it was brilliant nonetheless.
