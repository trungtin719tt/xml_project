DUE TO INTERNET ADVICE/ABUSE FROM A COMPLETE STRANGER, THIS REVIEW NOW CONFORMS TO GRAMMATICAL STANDARDS AND ALL THAT JAZZ, BUT IS STILL, AT THE END OF THE DAY, A BRIEF REVIEW OF A CHILDREN'S BOOK WITH. OH, BUT I STILL WON'T CAPITALIZE LETTERS. EXCEPT HERE. BECAUSE HERE, I AM SHOUTING TO BE HEARD IN EVERY TROLL CAVE IN THE LAND. RECOGNIZE.this book represents a series of firsts: the first book i have ever borrowed from work. and the first book i read for my summer class on "children's literature". and the first 500 page book i have read in an hour. so - all good things. it's a fun book. i think i like that it is notquitea graphic novel and it is notquitea regular novel, but it is some in-between hybrid new monster of a book. it's more superficial thanthe arrival(which i would love to see in a 500 page version, please, shaun tan), but it's sweet and pretty and maybe i will get an A when it comes time to write my annotations for class. (see, i know capital letters exist...)DOES THIS PLEASE YOU, STRANGER-DANGER? HAVE I PASSED THE INTERNET?
