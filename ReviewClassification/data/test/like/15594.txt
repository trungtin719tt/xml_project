My feelings for Daemon right now:My thoughts for those who do not ship Daemon and Katy when I read all the cute scenes of them together:TOO ADORABLE - I CAN'T TAKE ANYMORE OF DAEMON'S WICKED-HOT-BAD BOY-AND-DOWNRIGHT-GORGEOUS ACT!!This was such a cute short story - I was so depressed when it got to the end!! I wanted more!!! Can't wait until the next book - Jennifer's writing is addictive!Merged review:Uploaded withImageShack.usDamn, Daemon. Just...wow. :D
