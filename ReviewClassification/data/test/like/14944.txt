Someone's taking lethal shots at weres, including the leader of the Hotshot community, Calvin Norris and Sam, Sookie's boss. Calvin's people think it's Sookie's newly-turned brother Jason, but Sookie's determined to prove otherwise. In the meantime, she has to make a deal with Eric to get a temporary bartender to cover for Sam, and Alcide wants her help with the choosing of a new packmaster for the Shreveport werewolves. There's no rest for Sookie as her life is targeted several times, but thank god for her fairy godmother...There was less of a structured plot in this one and more of many little plots, some of which connect and some of which don't - but I found it more enjoyable than some of the more single-plotted books likeClub Dead. A whole parade of men tramp through Sookie's life wanting her attention and more: Eric, Bill, Sam, Alcide, Calvin and the new guy, Quinn. It gets quite crowded at times! But there's always something to keep us on our toes with Sookie and her crazy life.
