This is one of Anne Rice's best works in my opinion. It is part of the vampire series, but you should be able to understand &amp; enjoy the book without reading the others.The vampire, Lestat, is taken to heaven, hell, and back in time to creation and during the Christ era by Memnoch, the devil. The story told is one very different than the Bible, but it's good. I love Anne Rice's books because she tells the story in a way that it could be true. Anyways, it's a good book, but if you get upset by people twisting the stories of the Bible, it's probably not for you. Go read one of her new books like Christ the Lord. Anything she wrote after she was "born-again."
