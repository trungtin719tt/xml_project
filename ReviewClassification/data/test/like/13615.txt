Wow.... just wow.Words can't express how much I enjoyed this book. I think it might be the best book that I read so far. Maybe not the best, but it's surely my favorite.I loved everything in it, the story, the characters, the movie pictures and the ART. I adored every single illustration this book had.I would recommend this book to literally everyone who likes reading. It was just that good.
