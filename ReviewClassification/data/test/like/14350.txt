Such a great book!!! I rate this 4.5 stars. A wonderful 'epic' journey with characters 'not' to be forgotten. Its a rich and satisfying engaging story.Given the length of this book (500+ pages)---its amazing how easy it is to retain all the many details and every new character who gets introduced (must credit the writer).This book just 'flows'. Its the type of book I would have loved to read in the winter --curled up on the couched on a few cold chilly days-- read 'non-stop'....(but I didn't have the pleasure to read it quite that fast ---yet I never forgot a thing, even when I put it down for a day (busy doing something else) --I found myself sharing every detail of this story with my husband ---as I went along --(I got so involved)I think 'maybe' the only part of the book (for me) where the writer (or editing) might have made a correction is towards the end. (not the content) --The story line was perfect ---but the writing began to feel rushed -- (yet it 'was' time to end it) --I don't know how I would have done a damn thing better --[I'm no writer].I think the book needed a little better editing towards the 'end'---(it felt rushed--&amp; sometimes felt like it was taking 'too' long ---both at the same time) ---What do I know?Most: I loved the book ---Oh...AND....when I first was about to 'start' reading "The Forgotten Garden", I was 'fighting' liking it....I was 'looking' for fault, as I had voted for the 'other' book to read, (our book club picked it) --- I was sure this was going to be a long girlie-book -- which didn't even have historical 'reasons' for being long.... (I observed my 'already' negative thoughts ---then kept reading...I must say....I was WRONG....This book was 'enchanting'---'charming' ---magical ---heartfelt --*wonderful*!Its another one of those books --where you'd love to see the move come out. (knowing of course that the book will be better) ---but at least we get to be part of this story again).Beautiful author by the way. --Gee---can you get much more pretty? (and talented)! Congrats to her!I soooooooooooo admire these authors and what they do!:)
