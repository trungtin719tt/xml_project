Re-read 30/9/13:Re-reading this book was like visiting an old friend with agreatsense of humour! I fell in love with this series all over again from the very first page - the tale of Alex, the kickass halfblood heroine, and her journey, one that I will never, ever tire of :)Original Review"It was him - Aiden St.Delphi."As soon as I read that I was all like, "Oooooh yeah. She's got it baaaaaad." But then I read about how pures and halfs can't be together and I was all:Shit. Is. Going. To. Go. Down.What really annoyed me was that no one seemed to have any faith in her. I mean - hello?! The girl survived on her own and killed two daimons, plus she saw her mum die. I think I wasn't the only annoyed one - Alexandria was pretty upset too. But Aiden's like "No one here is your enemy, Alex, it's all in your head - I'm sure they all want to come over and have a tea party later on."Sure, buddy...sure.Kickass - with tonnes of action, a brilliant new world and Armentrout's signature humour - this book is epic and is a definite must-read.
