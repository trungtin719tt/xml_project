I kind of surprised I liked this bookat all, because:a)I read pathetically little non-fictionb)I'veneverread a travelogueANDc)I'm only a fan of the GreatOutdoorsas long as I'm safelyIndoors.So, color me shocked that I not onlyfinishedthis, but giggled my way through quite a bit of it! Bryson really is a pretty funny writer, and the way he captured his experience on the Appalachian Trail had me in tears a few times. His fears about getting mauled by a bear (among other things) before he started off were especially hysterical, and maybe that's because I could see a lot ofmyselfin his initial terror of spending so much time surrounded by...NATURE!Now, there was a decent-sized chunk towards the middle of the book that I just had to grit my teeth and push on through. Bryson's friend Katz wasn't with him during this portion, and the difference in the tone of the writing is really noticeable. Lots and lotsand lotsof mind-numbing details about the Trail, and very little ofhisexperiences.And whileallof that sort of info is relevant to the book, it's also the main reason that I don't actively seek outnon-fictionortravelogues.Eventually, Katz comes back to finish out the hike, and the story vastly improves, but it never managed to recapture the humor or spirit that it had in the beginning.But that's only MYopinion.And I reallydidenjoy thelast bitsof the book a lot. Especially the moments between Katz &amp; Bryson there towards the end.Overall, I'd say this was a winner. And even if the whole thing wasn't to my liking, the first half was an easy 5 star read for me.In fact, it made me want to call up my BFF to see if she wanted to take the kids camping this summer so we could poop near a waterfall!You know, instead of meeting at a hotel on the beach and drinking ourselves silly while the kids play in the surf.And then I thought about that sentence.Bwahahahahahahaha!No. Just...no.See you in Florida, Jill! I'll bring the blender!
