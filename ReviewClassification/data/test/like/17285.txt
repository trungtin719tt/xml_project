Without spoilers, I love reading anything by Rick Riordan. His Percy Jackson series may be for YA but I'm middle aged and WILL read this series any time I get a chance. Percy Jackson and his friends each have the weaknesses out in the open, ready to cause one stumbling block after another. Then Mr Riordan takes those seeming weaknesses and shock the reader with a surprise that turns weakness into strength. Nothing is what it seems, the mysteries intertwine, the humor has perfect timing and the world of teens and Greek gods is perfectly meshed into an alternative reality well-explained.
