This is one of the most haunting novels I have ever read about World War 1. The title comes from the the practice of coal miners bringing a "canary in the coal mine" to test for bad air. In WW 1 hundreds of British coal miners were drafted into the British Army to help build tunnels under the trenches in France. The main character leaves Britain and enters the War after a failed affair....the descriptions of trench warfare, tunnel making, nerve gas, human carnage and the waste of war is a powerful antiwar statement. Years later, when the main character's grandaughter tries to find out more about his life and visits "VA type" hospitals she is stunned to see veterans whose minds and bodies have been destroyed by gas and wound infections...a dark chapter in humanity and the first of Faulk's books on war. Extremely well-written and researched...as powerful as "All Quiet on The Western front" Outstanding.
