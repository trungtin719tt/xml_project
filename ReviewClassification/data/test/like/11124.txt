Second read 5th May 2017. Still great book and my opinion remains unchanged so my original review bellow will remain unchanged (not counting correction of few spelling errors that I missed initially).This might be the best YA dystopian novel I read and what makes book great are not huge plot twists and big WOW moments, it's the small things.First of all the setting.While it's never main focus and there isn't whole lot of world building but what is there builds into idyllic world, almost a paradise.And then the humans came.I can't help but being reminded of quote from Bradbury's Martian chronicles:"We earth men have a talent for ruining big, beautiful things". Unlike most YA books fanaticism, xenophobia and hate in this book are so real and palpable.Second big plus for this book is that I finally found young, idealistic protagonist who I don't find annoying.My opinion is that no kill policy works well only for Batman but despite that I really grown attached to Todd and at no point I wished for him to die horrible death which happens fairly rarely when I read YA sci-fi/fantasy books.Also his relationship with dog Munchee is one of the highlight of this book.While it never takes spotlight it start from almost antagonism it slowly develops into true friendship.And this is how you do a talking dog, are you taking notes Kevin Hearne?
