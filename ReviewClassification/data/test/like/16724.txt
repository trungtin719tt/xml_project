[Original review, Feb 22 2016]DISCLAIMER:It would evidently be irresponsible to call Donald Trump a Nazi merely on the strength ofa recent speech in which he suggested it would be desirable to shoot Muslims using bullets dipped in pig's blood.A more plausible interpretation is that this is no more than the result of dispassionately calculating that the upside in terms of increasing his attractiveness to the ignorant racist demographic is larger than the downside in terms of decreasing his appeal to many people who already can't stand him. But I admit that I'm no expert on these matters, and I could be wrong._______________________[Update, Mar 13 2016]look at me im davy crockettsays, in comment #80,there is no reason to attempt to reason with "Manny" he is a neurotic bigoted freak who is clearly so deeply insane or at least disturbed in how obsessive he is and should on matters of his repeated spam, violating ToS should be banned without having to consider him personally or his speechLooking at the original review, I am a little uncertain about just what it is that Mr. Crockett is so violently taking exception to. I posted a link to a video clip in which Donald Trump suggested that it would be a good idea to shoot Muslims using bullets dipped in pig's blood. I went on say that IDIDN'Tthink this made him a Nazi, just a politician who is trying to please the ignorant racist demographic. I concluded that, since I was no expert on the subject, I might be mistaken.Well, I'm baffled. Mr. Crockett clearly doesn't like something I've said. Does he thinka) that the video clip in question has been faked by the liberal media to discredit Mr. Trump,b) that the idea of shooting Muslims with bullets dipped in pig's blood will not please the ignorant racist demographic, orc) that I am in fact an expert on the subject, and should not disingenuously claim the contrary?Mr. Crockett, please clarify. I'm sure other people would like to know too._______________________[Update, Aug 16 2017]I wanted to wait until I had more information, a policy recently advocated by Mr. Trump himself. And I'd hate to offend Mr. Crockett further. But all the same, the evidence we've acquired over the last few days does seem to increase the probability that Mr. Trump is a Nazi. He sounds sincere when defending the white supremacist terrorist attack in Charlottesville, and one can't help feeling his behaviour means something.That said, I freely admit I haven't got a statistically tight argument yet. It's just anecdotal.
