I went into this book with absolutely no expectations, not a single one, I just wanted to read a book, any book. Well knock me flat on my ass because I didn't expectthat. I didn't expect awesome on a stick (a really hot stick named Braden). Expectations be damned!If we're talking cock full of awesome, then why not 5-stars? Well...the first 30ish percent I just wasn't sure. Do I like this book? Where's it going? Is more coming? Is it getting better? What do I think? I DON'T KNOW!! Then all of the sudden the gigantic hand of awesome came out of the book, grabbed me, and didn't let go!! Not to mention the hand of awesome knewexactlywhat it was doing.It was one of those books that just kept getting better and better. It was like a ball gaining speed rolling down a steep hill...except there were two balls and those balls belonged to Braden. He was the perfect mix of hard and soft, alpha and prince charming, protector and lover.This book gave me everything I needed and more. It gave me everything I needed on the desk...against a wall...against a cabinet...on the couch...EVERYWHERE! But it wasn't just about sex! It had a great story line, awesome characters, and several funny moments. There was a "tickle" scene that caused laughter to shoot from all my orifices! Not to mention I fell in love with Els and Adam. I was almost just as wrapped up in the secondary characters as I was with Joss and Braden.My only complaint was that everything happened too fast, I wanted more. More time with Braden and Joss...more Els and Adam...more epilogue...MORE!!! Please, PLEASE Samantha Young give me more!!!READ ON!
