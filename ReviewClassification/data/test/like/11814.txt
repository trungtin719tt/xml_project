The Power of Myth is based on a series of interviews Bill Moyers conducted with Joseph Campbell in the mid 1980's."Myths are clues to the spiritual potentialities of the human life," explains Joseph Campbell near the very beginning of the narrative. His definition of myth, rather than being that myths are examples of the search for life's meaning, is that myths are the ongoing search for "the experience of life". According to Campbell, what myths tell us is that the meaning of life is the experience of life: "Eternity isn't some later time, eternity isn't a long time. Eternity has nothing to do with time! It is that dimension of here and now which thinking and time cuts out. If you don't get it here, you won't get it anywhere. The experience of eternity right here and now is the function of life."For me, The Power of Myth was a powerful and riveting experience, and it's all the more so for its seeming simplicity. In that way, it too is like the myths Campbell loved. Joseph Campbell wasn't preaching from that chair as he sat across from Bill Moyers, he was sharing the clues that he had gathered in his ongoing search for "the experience of life".
