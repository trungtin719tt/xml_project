I remember reading this over and over when I was in high school, just for my own pleasure. Then I got to college, and took an actual mythology class, and the first thing the professor said was, "I hope you all haven't been reading junk like Edith Hamilton." What?! Well, most of his problem was with those bite-sized little rundowns of the myths, which is what I liked about it. It's a nice survey of Greek mythology, an introduction, if you will. There are a few inaccuracies, and she barely mentions things like Hercules' trials or the Voyage of the Argo, which are studied in much greater depth generally. The inaccuracies are some names that she's gotten wrong, which may or may not be typos. My biggest complaint is that she doesn't go much into the Norse mythology (my favorite), which would have been fine, except for her attitude in the intro that she doesn't get into it more because it basically isn't worth her time or anyone else's.
