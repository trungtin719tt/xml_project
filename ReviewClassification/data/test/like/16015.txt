I don't know about others but writing the review ofThe Horse Whispererhas proved to be immensely difficult. What I'm writing here is a review about a book that couldn't have been written any better.Nicholas Evans spins a heart wrenching epic love story that thrives and dies amid sorrow and pain. Tom Booker comes as a healer to a family in grief and heals the wounds that have gone deep into the very souls.Buy it, borrow it or steal it. But don't miss this gem for anything."Sometimes what seems like surrender isn't surrender at all. It's about what's going on in our hearts. About seeing clearly the way life is and accepting it and being true to it, whatever the pain, because the pain of not being true to it is far, far greater."
