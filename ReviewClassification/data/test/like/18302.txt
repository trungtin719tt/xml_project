Going back and re-reading these four novels for the first time since I read them to my children when they were young was an exercise of pure joy. In the intervening years I had forgotten what a beautiful prose writer L'Engle was. Appropriate for the subject matter, the language she employs is indeed touched with the music of the spheres and reading her descriptions of these cosmic adventures is nothing short of magical for the reader and what grand adventures they are.
