Journey to the End of the Night "tells about the life of medical students". Ferdinand Bardamu, from the First World War on bush stories in the deepest Africa and a galley trip to America until the return to France as a poor doctor.The novel carries mainly autobiographical features. How Celine marches his protagonist Bardamu as a worker, doctor, people and lover through the turmoil of war and the societies in Africa, America and Paris. With one language ahead of the next, Celine's focus on everything that bothers him seems hypocritical and disastrous. The Church, the state, the national pride, the middle-class petty bourgeoisie, the decadent upper class and humanity in itself, Celine buttoned relentlessly. Great Novel!
