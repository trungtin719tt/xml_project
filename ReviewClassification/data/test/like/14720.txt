The night I finished this, my mind was left reeling from it for a couple of hours and the next day I was unable to get it out of my head.Shutter Island is a departure from the Kenzie/Gennaro series andit's one of those novels that will certainly leave you pondering the whole story once you're finished it.The less you know about the story, the better. Suffice it to say, this is an excellent read and there are very few novels I have read that made my head buzz for hours after.Don't miss this, read it before the movie comes out.
