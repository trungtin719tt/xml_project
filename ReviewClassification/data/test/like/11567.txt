All the Bright Places is the story of how Theodore Finch and Ultraviolet are brought together by death--which would be gloomy, except the two personalities bloom, becoming something beautiful, as their wondrous adventures bring them closer together. Jennifer Niven takes a girl meets boy story, sets it in the dull landscape of Indiana, and turns it into a Seussical wonderworld with these extraordinarily conflicted characters.Saying their journey is a rollercoaster would be a understatement. It's an amusement park. Every scene is a different thrill ride. With a character as explosive as Finch and one with a troubled background like Ultraviolet, falling in love and knockout fights go hand and hand. All the Bright Places takes you to All the Good Places and All the Bad Places and everywhere in between, and the words that take you there are spellbinding.Jennifer Niven just knocks it out of the park with this story in every way: the dialogue is so real it's haunting, she paints scenes so well you forget you're not watching a movie, and Theodore Finch and Ultraviolet go down with Holden Caulfield and Holly Golightly as characters you're sure never to forget.
