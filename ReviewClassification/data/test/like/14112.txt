This series is SO AMAZING!!! It is about a zombie raising/vampire hunter! She is so awesome! She is very tough and reminds me of Buffy the Vampire Slayer only WAY more kick butt and knowledgeable about Vamps! DO NOT read this series if you don't like sex in your books. At first there is no sex, but as the series goes on, there is more and more of it! The stories are so action packed and there are so many twists and turns that you just can't put these books down!! Honestly, I started with book one, Guilty Pleasures, back in February and I did not stop reading these books until I got through the entire 15 book series!!! Now, I get the treat of a new book on WED May 27th! Seriously, this is my all time favorite series of books!!!
