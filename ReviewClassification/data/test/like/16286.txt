I can see why this play is little appreciated nowadays - it runs so completely counter to the modern notions of "gender equality" and feminism. I freely confess that Petruchio's methods with Katharina are rough (in an indirect manner; from passionate reviews I expected him to beat her every day before breakfast, but in fact he uses crazier, more shrewish means). On the other hand, she frankly deserves what she gets. She was not "strong-minded" - she was downright nasty, and the way Petruchio brings their relationship around to something like what it ought to be was hilarious. He was mercenary; she was a shrew; but in the end, I think they were the couple best suited to each other. To modern ears the moral Katharina pronounces at the end will probably be grating, and probably it was meant by Shakespeare to be rather tongue-in-cheek (itisa comedy); but it is not far off the mark, for all its hyperbole.Lighthearted, insane, and very politically incorrect, I think "The Taming of the Shrew" might have displaced "Much Ado About Nothing" as my favorite Shakespearean comedy.Also, I wish an adaptation had been made with Anthony Andrews as Petruchio.
