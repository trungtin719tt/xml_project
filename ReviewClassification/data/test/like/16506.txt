I began Ki Longfellow with a book called Houdini Heart which staggered me with its language, ideas, use of superb metafiction, and storytelling. So, of course, I wanted more of the same. I read another of her titles, this one - Walks Away Woman. It wasn't anything like Houdini Heart. And yet I loved it. Wandering about in the Sonoran Desert with a broken down housewife who comes to life in a most wonderful way. So I went off to find another Walks Away Woman and discovered Longfellow doesn't repeat herself unless you count her charming, funny, and mysterious Sam Russo noir murder mysteries. I can't really think of another writer who reinvents her work with every book. Or one who can write so well in so many styles and genres. I honestly believe if she'd stuck with one genre (like writing something like her The Secret Magdalene over and over) as most writers do, she'd be a household name by now. But she hasn't. So someone like me didn't find her until I stumbled over her. I am thrilled I did. BIG HANDS UP.
