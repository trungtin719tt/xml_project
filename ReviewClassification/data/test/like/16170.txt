Man, I've read this book at least 10 times and it is just as horrific as all the other times I've read it. Definitely in my roving top 10 of Mr. Kings stories. I would actually like to thank my library, "Lewis and Clark" and all library's that do ebooks. What a difference! I've got hard and soft bound copies of all my favorite books, but I can't read them because of arthritis. So, I get these intense urges to re-read something, and unless I've bought it for my kindle, then I'm skee-rude! I hate spending 8 to 16 dollars for something that I have 2 copies of on my bookshelves. So, again...Modern day libraries rock!
