This book is in my top favorites list. Kinda wished I would've read it sooner because it had the perfect blend of magic, friendship, bad guys that should be either shot or kicked in a hole somewhere remote, unforgettable characters (main characters or not) and a awesome story plot, that didn't get off track. My absolute favorite character, even though he wasn't the main male character, is Ronan Lynch. It was love at first sarcastic comment.Really can't wait to read the rest of this series and hopefully they're as good as or better than this one.
