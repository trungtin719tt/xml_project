For me, this was a mystical quest hiding in a deliciously simple tale of what everyone secretly wants to, not just women. We all want to walk away from the mess we've made of our lives, from the commitments, the hardships of owning things, of striving for things, even from the burden of those we love. We want to set those burdens down and be free. Go Molly!
