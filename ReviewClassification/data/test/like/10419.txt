They'll understand.CAESAR: I'll get my coat.*Caesar skips off to the Senate, confident in the knowledge that he's in a Shakespeare play, where dreams don't predict anything and main characters never get offed*CAESAR: Hey, why didn't anyone tell me it was Bring A Dagger To Work Day?THE ENTIRE FUCKING SENATE: WE KEEL YOU!CASSIUS: Good, he's dead.
