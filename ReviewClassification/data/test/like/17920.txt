But like so many people said it before me and too many say it after me..this book is the Masterpiece!It is so diverse and sophisticated, combines melancholy and brutal realism,a truly timeless work that describes so many sides and motives of human soul. Many characters that you instantly recognise...as if they have been reincarnated into people you know. The divine words strung together to create a perfection! Verse after verse you read and everytime one exclaims:"How true!!!" And not a word that sounds remotely awkward and out of place. When things described in a new way, the uncliched combination of qualities that are true but never heard of.The tender and affectionate way to describe the Nature that reaches somewhere deep inside of you and makes you so very fond of times unknown to you, yet so familiar, so dear. The immaculate balance of showing purity and the best of feelings one might possess without a mild hint of being accused as being rosy or dramatic.What shocked me the most is that I couldn't mock it in any way (!). In fact, line after line, i felt how it was stirring something deep in my heart and if it would be immensely dramatic to say that it resembled the story of my life, to an extent its true. All the purity and openness one once possesed and tiny agonies experienced when learning the imperfections of human nature and slow accumulation of a thicker skin...I don't know about the English translation, hardly it is capable of keeping even 1/20th of the beauty of the original...I pity those who don't have the opportunity to enjoy it in Russian.
