3.75 starsFor me, this installment of the Black Dagger Brotherhood was similar as the one right before it (Lover Unbound), wherein the story outside of the central couple was more interesting to me than the story of the two main characters.A big bombshell is dropped at the very beginning of the book (and since it's the beginning, I don't think it's a true "spoiler"): The Omega (a wholly evil entity) fathered a son with a vampire civilian in order to infiltrate the Brotherhood as a foot soldier and be able to provide The Lesssening Society (his minions) with inside information on the Brotherhood and as well as the glymera (the aristocracy of the vampire society). The Omega believes that his son will be the key to bringing down the forces working against him. As the reader is aware from the previous novels that there are a handful of characters of age that could potentially be his son (they are all being trained by the Brotherhood to assist in the fight against the lessers), it's a guessing game to determine which it is. For me, it was obvious, but the author may have intentionally made it so - his identity is revealed at the end of this book, so we aren't left waiting for very long.The central love story in this book involves Phury, who does his best to avoid reality by smoking his body weight in drugs to stay muddled at all times, and Cormia, a member of The Chosen, who does not feel that she quite fits in with the rest of her "sisters" as she has actual opinions and wants to be an individual. Phury, in his signature self-sacrificing nature, has stepped in for V who was the original choice as Primale (the member of the Brotherhood tasked with impregnating the members of The Chosen to produce vampires of exceptional bloodline to repopulate the dwindling numbers of their race). One problem: Phury is a 200+ year old virgin. His reasoning for abstaining for so long was initially because he needed to focus on rescuing his twin who was stolen as a child, so he took a vow of chastity to prove his worth. Even after succeeding in his mission to save his brother from those who enslaved him for 125 (or so) years, he remained celibate almost as a self-punishment. He carries a lot of guilt that his twin was taken but he was not as the reverse could have easily been the case. Yet the more he gives of himself and sacrifices to try to "even the score," the more pain he brings upon himself; thus, his need to escape reality often.The main female character is Cormia, a member of The Chosen, who was selected to be the first female the Primale mated with. She is also a virgin and has no interest in being the sacrificial lamb on behalf of her sisters (many of whom would literally jump at the chance to serve the Primale), and she is terrified of the thought of mating with one of the giant members of the Brotherhood. Upon meeting Phury, she realizes he isn't as scary as originally thought, and her feelings start to warm towards him, though he still refuses to consummate their relationship almost half a year into the Primale role.For me, there was very little chemistry between the two characters during the course of the story. Since Phury avoided her at every turn, there was not much relationship-building happening. Towards the end of the book after they were together, the chemistry was more present, but it felt like things went from "I don't want anything to do with you!" to "I need/love you!" with minimal interaction between the two of them, so that aspect wasn't very believable or compelling.As I mentioned earlier, the broader story of the war between the Brotherhood and the Lessening Society (and even the glymera, to an extent) was the main draw for me of this installment. A lot of things unfolded in the book and set things up for later books nicely. I'm looking forward to finding out how things go for Rhevenge (who has been a bit of an enigma up until now) in the next book in this series.
