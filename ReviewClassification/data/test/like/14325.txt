After reading Mystic River, I think Dennis Lehane might've become my new favorite mystery writer since Harlan Coben and David Baldacci! A very powerful tale of murder, friendship, murder, suspense, and betrayal, everything you want from a Mystery, and it leaves you wanting more!One afternoon in the streets of Boston, 3 longtime friends, Jimmy Marcus, Sean Devine, and Dave Boyle are roughhousing, when a mysterious car with 2 men pulls up, one of the men posing as a cop gets out and starts berating the boys, and orders Dave into the car. The car takes off with Dave in the back of the car, leaving Jimmy and Sean to stare off at the car. After missing for 4 days, Dave escapes his abductors and returns home with the horror ending the boys friendships, and they all part ways.Now many years later, the boys are all grown up with their own families, and their own dark pasts. Jimmy is an ex-con, now currently running a local convenient store, Sean is a Homicide Detective with the Boston Police Department, and Dave is still haunted by his abduction. Now one Katie Marcus, the daughter of Jimmy and his second wife Annabeth, is found murdered near a liquor bar where she was right before she was killed. The murder brings Jimmy, Sean, and Dave back together, all of them having ties to the murder, and leading back many years. Sean is put in charge of the case, questioning Katie's friends, her boyfriend, and any others who saw her before she was murdered, Jimmy wanting to find the killer himself for vengeance, and Dave having a possible connection when he returns home covered in blood, and is questioned by his wife Celeste, Dave claims he killed a man who was trying to rob him, but he tells the cops and everyone else different stories, and none of them add up.Unfortunately I saw the movie before reading the book, because it was directed by Clint Eastwood, and I'm like a hardcore Clint Eastwood fan, he's like a LIVING LEGEND!! And starring Sean Penn, Tim Robbins, and Kevin Bacon, more of my favorite actors, and I loved the movie too, but compared to the book, it put the movie right to shame!Mystic River is an excellent story written by an excellent author! It's a great psychological read too, at times you like the characters, other times you hate them, it makes you wonder who to side with, and also gives you the feeling of right and wrong.Those who have not seen the movie and want to read the book, take it from me, READ THE BOOK FIRST!! Because if you watch the movie first, it'll ruin the shocking twist at the end for you! It's funny because like I said I saw the movie first so I knew how the book was going to end, because the book followed the movie almost 100%, with just a few little differences.If anyone's looking for a good solid mystery with deep character depth, this book is for you!!
