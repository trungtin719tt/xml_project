Such a diversity of emotions I felt while reading this. Although I was rather bored in the preliminary introductions of horse and the men around said horse, I hung on for dear life along with the jockies during the detailed descriptions of the races. There are actually two climaxes to the story, two long-anticipated races in Seabiscuit's career. I felt chills and tears in my eyes during these perfectly-described, history-making events. I wish I had read Seabscuit's story before I and a group of college friends went to the Kentucky Derby back in 1973; maybe I could have convinced our impatient driver not to make us leave to get a heads up on traffic prior to the last, most important race of that day, Secretariat's.
