Well I just finished this book and let me just say that I have never been so happy to have puffs tissues in my house. My eyes are so swollen from crying its crazy. This was defiantly one of the darker books I've read from sparks. However, it still managed to rip me apart and them put me back together again... Sorta. I always lose a part of myself with a good book. I feel this is also the reason why some books stay with me for a while and why these same books stir emotions in me that both amaze me and scare the shit out of me as well. This book ( damn you sparks) did this to me. It will stay with me for some time and touched me on levels that I have a hard time explaining. This book took you down a topic that I feel so many women and children and maybe even men ( it could happen) have to live with every day. Abuse, physical, emotionally and mentally. This story discussed domestic abuse. While this was one of sparks more darker, twisted plots, he was able to write the story in a way that gave just enough information but still let you to fill in some blanks. Something clever I thought sparks did was wrote some of the book from Kevin's ( the abuser) POV. This was both intriguing and disturbing. Kevin, very obviously had some issues. His rants were fighting and insane and often times jumped around in a disturbing manner. I feel he may of had a mental disorder as well. He's touch on reality was hanging on by a thread, if at all. And then there was Katie's relationship with her friend Jo. The twist at the end dealing with Jo and the friendship was...beautiful. It healed my heart with soothing salve. Sparks has a way of bringing out a reaction in me that often times leaves me to wonder why I put myself through his books time after time. Then I read a part in the book that reminds me. He always reminds me why and puts me back in my place. In most cases these moments come in the form of a letter someone has either left behind or has been given to someone. Say what you want about the author. Love him. Hate him. Tolerate him. But never. Ever underestimate the man when he writes his letters. They are often my favorite and more memorable moments in his books. And for this, Nicholas Sparks, I both love you and hate you.
