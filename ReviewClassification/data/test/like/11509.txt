Wow....what a book! This was a long one to be sure. But, happily for me, back on par with Outlander and Voyager! After really loving the series through #3, the 4th and 5th books were somewhat disappointing for me. Both of them were way too long and I actually was bored in parts. The story left Scotland and Europe and came to the American colonies. The story started out ok but then got monotonous for me. I also didn't like what happened to some of the characters and felt some of them had very little parts to play. In this book however, I felt many questions were answered, characters were back and so was the action. Rape, murder, savages, illness, fire....lying, cheating, stealing....people died...more babies were born....it truly had it all! I'll take a bit of a break before moving on to #7. For fans of this series....this is a good one!!
