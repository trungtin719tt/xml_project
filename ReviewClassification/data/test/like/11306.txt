Review with my funny face?http://youtu.be/mZyzt0qw7tgI enjoyed thehellout of this book. At one point, and I shit you not, I literally yelled "FUN!". Don't worry I was in my bedroom so no side eye whatsoever.I was simply enthralled.I've seen people said so and so is an 'atmospheric book' and I have never truly understood what they meant before. Until i picked this up.The Raven Boyswas the definition ofambien and mystery. And I was simply lost to hours of intensely joyful read.I got so invested in these characters: I could read and read and read their stories.Blue, Gansey, Adam, Ronan, Noah- the most adorable and emotionally-layered gang I ever got to know. And loved. These five, ah, they just clicked and yes even with ronan on his bad days (I think..? lol). There was such genuine and easy comraderie between them that so refreshing to read about. The boys were already good friends from school yet when their gang expanded to include Blue, it was done so seamlessly almost like it was supposed to happen all along. She was supposed to come along and complete the group dynamic. And I, for one, glad she did. I just loved Blue.The ladies at 300 Fox Way - they knew how to be the best kind of eccentric: with class and warmth and near fatal humor.If you ever want to get lost in a book, in a worldwith so much care, so much charms and imaginations -I welcome you to my beloved Henrietta.
