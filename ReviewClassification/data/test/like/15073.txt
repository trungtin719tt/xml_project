This book, much likeThe Giver, andNumber the Stars, was one that I always,ALWAYSsaw lying around during mid-elementary/junior high... even high school.One of those books that I never got around to reading.I just realized that all three of these books have a little gold circle somewhere on the cover - so maybe that means my teachers just always had Newberry Medal Winners on hand. Maybe my kids will be saying the same thing aboutWhen You Reach Me... Who knows...The teachers were right to have this one in their rooms. It's very good. It doesn't paint a rosy picture of Jim Crow south, but you know what? It's not all black and white (pun intended) and I appreciate that as well.White does not always equal bad, and black does not always equal good in this book. The characters are more complex than that, and there's quite a cast, as well.That said, man racism drives me crazy.Several parts will probably stick with me from this book, but if there's one I want to stick with me, it's the scene where students are receiving their text books. Every kid from a public school remembers filling these out at the beginning of the year... although, that may soon be replaced by digital everything...You know:(Caveat Emptor onthatbook, by the way...)At any rate, there were spots for the white school, and spots for the black school. The first dozen years it was issued, it was issued to the white school - with the condition of the book moving from "new" to "good." From "good" to.... well you get it. Once the books were "poor" they were given to the black school. Maybe something minor, but the minor is often indicative of the major.Roll of Thunder is a work of fiction, butMildred D. Taylorwrote an afterward for this edition, in which she talks about developing these stories from the stories she heard during her childhood.Most of us, by this point, have heard these tales of state-sanctioned racism before. They're worth hearing again. And in Newberry fashion.I'll be going back and reading the rest of this series soon.
