Why is this book tagged with such a low average score? I'm exhausted (in a good way) after reading The Girl on the Train. I can imagine the latter being a sensation upon publishing.Rachel is the girl on the train. She is the key to everything that happens in the book, but she's an unreliable witness. Or is she? This book blew my mind. I just finished reading it.Looked at from a distance, it has a slightly ridiculous tinge to it. It's larger than life. But it's good storytelling. Damn good. I wish I had read it sooner.The way I judge books is different from the way I judge songs. If a song sounds like I could have invented it, I don't listen to it again. That doesn't happen with books. 99.9 % of all books I've read are beyond my ability to write them.Back to The Girl on the Train, read it if you haven't yet. It's not life, it's fiction at its best.
