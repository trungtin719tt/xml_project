RICHELLE MEAD, I AM ABOUT TO TURN INTO A RAGING STRIGOI.THAT WAS SERIOUSLY THE WORST ENDING EVER. LIKE WHAT THE--I CAN'T EVEN COMPREHEND HOW IDIOTIC SYDNEY IS. ADRIAN IS CLEARLY MEANT TO BE WITH HER.*HEAVY, MURDEROUS BREATHING*THIS IS WHAT I FEEL LIKE DOING TO SYDNEY:Okay enough with the caps.The only thing is, I found it annoying how Adrian kept reiterating that he was a better person because of her. Like that hasn't ever come up in YA lit before..but still. He was pretty swoon-worthy. And I don't usually fan girl for this type of thing.In conclusion, I hate you Richelle Mead.Just kidding. I don't know how I would survive without your books, but still. I might turn into a monster if you don't allow Adrian and Sydney to be together.[image error]
