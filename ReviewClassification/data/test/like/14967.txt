I met Pat Conroy at a book signing event in Atlanta when this book was released. There just so happened to be another Furman Alumni in line ahead of us and I heard Conroy say something about Furman. I spoke up making sure he knew I was there. His response was something like "You Furman people are like Lynx, you're everywhere!" So, thinking I understood that his spat with The Citadel had turned him sour against the school I made some smartass, derogatory comment about The Citadel. He signed my book "Citadel Forever, Pat Conroy." I'm such a jackass.I've read this book at least 3 times and I've cried at the ending all three times. The first time I was in a room full of prospective jurors waiting to be called for duty in Marietta, GA. I had to go to the restroom to finish the last page or two and collect myself before going back out into that room of 200 strangers. Beautiful, beautiful book.
