Confession: I actually DNF'ed Tuesdays with Morrie sometime last year. I thought it was pretentious, dull and lack narration.So I wasn't exactly excited to read For One More Day, but someone gave it to me during last year's Secret Pumpkin. Thank you again!I'm glad that this book was as enjoyable as it was. Even though it's like a Hallmark cut out story (I did catch a part of its telemovie on Hallmark a long time ago), but it's pure, simple and raw.It doesn't attempt to do too much but gives out a lot anyway.
