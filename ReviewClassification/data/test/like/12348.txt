We are not allowed to have our own thoughts. We are not allowed to dream, we are not allowed to BE. At age 15 we are told what we will be doing every day until we are 40, when we will enter the Home of The Useless. We are not allowed to think about anything other than what we are told to think. We ourselves are not important, the great collective WE is all that matters.But not all of us are content to be simply part of the herd. Some of us think for ourselves even though we know it is a sin which could put our lives in danger. We find a way to nurture ourselves within that great WE and we survive. But surviving is not enough: how do we learn to Live?I was intrigued by this book and I think it is even more relevant in our day than when it was written. I look around and see people being molded into a great herd that follows orders: Buy this, Drink that, Eat here, Do this, Don't say that, You need this, You cannot do that. Is it possible that in a few more generations society will be just as Rand describes it? Or are there enough people left with minds of their own to avoidthat scenario?Society has to have rules, but there needs to be a balance between that collective WE and the individual that makes up the WE. Too much of one and you get a cold distopian world like that in Anthem. Too much of the other and you have no civilization at all.This was the first work by Ayn Rand for me. I tried to readAtlas Shruggedonce and could not get past the first few pages, and after that I was too intimidated to even openThe Fountainhead. But now I want to see what else Rand had to say.
