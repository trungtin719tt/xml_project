My first Barbara Kingsolver book. Won't be my last. It is so BEAUTIFULLY written. Every sentence is crafted - which means it's quite a slow read; no skipping through paragraphs like most books. It has the jewel-like clarity and intensity of Ian McEwan but without the prissy, look-at-me-I'm-so-clever that creeps into his work.Such vivid characters, each with their own voice. There were clear themes running through the book reflecting Kingsolver's detailed knowledge of biology and farming: evolution, the danger of man destroying any of the earth's creatures because of the knock-on effect, a fantastic exposition on why spraying insecticides on crops makes the problem worse. I've just gone and made this book sound boring haven't I? But it isn't; it's quietly gripping and life affirming.
