This is by far my favorite book ever! I started this knowing how much I enjoyed Gone Girl and when I got started with this I couldn't put it down. My soul bonded to this book from the first word. Page turner and an unforgettable ride. A hell of a ride. The movie is just as good and I can rarely say that about books and movies. Ugh, great, spectacular, amazing, eventful, mind-blowing, utterly fantastic. Read this book!!!!!! After reading Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl I knew I had to read her other novels. I AM SO GLAD I DID! Out of her three novels, Dark Places is by far my favorite. This book had that dark element to it that made me want to read and read and read. I had a very hard time putting it down to deal with reality. My mother read it at the same time as I did and she kept calling me throughout the book and telling me about it. We both enjoyed it. I love books like this one, where the main character has a skewed idea of what really happened and then goes on a journey to learn the real fate of that horrible night... and it was indeed a horrible night. I truly felt for this family and the fates they all suffered. I think a part of every one of them died that night. Superb novel!!!! Read and watch movie if you haven't! Both are spectacular.
