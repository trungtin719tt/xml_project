This book was pretty good. There was action, suspense, and some romance. The main character was witty and any reader would be able to relate to them since she had boy, friend, family and identity problems. This book occasionally reminded me of Harry Potter because of some of the teachers being both harsh and grandmotherly at times. Rachel Hawkins also captured the rea high school life and drama in this with their own version of Prom, cliques, relationships, and talking about teachers behind their backs. The ending was sad somewhat but you are going to have to read to find out what it is :) Overall this book is good if you are looking for:a good introduction to a seriessuspensefantasyromanceand great characters.
