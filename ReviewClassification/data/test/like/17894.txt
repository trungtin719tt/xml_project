I have seen the TV adaptation so many times, it's a Christmas tradition around here, that it is hard to separate my affection for the show with my affection for the writing of Pratchett. The guy from Hustle is great as Teatime and the girl from Downton Abbey perfect as Susan Death, and they both bring the two central characters to life in such a way that the book feels very flat in comparison but as a standalone Discworld novel on the nature of belief it's almost as good as Small Gods with the silly humour toned down a little.
