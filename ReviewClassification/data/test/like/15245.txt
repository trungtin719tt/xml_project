I first read this book when it came out and loved it. It was one of the few books I'd read that focused predominantly on werewolves. I've read MANY since and so I went back and reread this because I was curious if it would hold up against the masses. Oh boy. It did.Let me just say that out of all paranormal books I've read, Clay has to be one of the sexiest, if notthesexiest male character. I'm not sure why exactly, maybe it's because nothing about him is really overdone, a lot of his appeal is in his silence. He doesn't have to build a monument to himself and then stand on top of it screaming that he's an alpha like some characters. With him, you just know it. And you want it.BAD.
