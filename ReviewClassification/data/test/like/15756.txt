Saw the movie before reading the book and glad it closely followed the story written by Grisham. They did one minor change, or a major one depending on one's perspective. In the book the lawsuit was aimed at the tobacco industry. The movie targets the gun industry, both powerful industries.When a family decides to take on the tobacco industry and hold them accountable for the death of a family member who got hooked on their product, the tobacco industry pulls no punches, employing a legal expert who directs the law team handling the defense from behind-the-scenes. With millions of dollars in the bank for him to use at his discretion, Rankin Fitch employs the latest hi-tech needed to track potential jurors and get into how they think. This allows him to choose jurors who will likely vote the way he wants them too.....But then the unexpected happens!Someone who is not who he appears to be worms his way onto the jury and turns out to be a wild card. As things develop it turns out this 'someone' has an agenda who wants to bring the tobacco industry down, and his powers of persuasion are quite strong. With the help of a young, strange woman on his team, this juror begins a twisted battle with those favoring the tobacco's case, and soon Fitch realizes he no longer has the jury following his lead. Thus, Fitch employs a more dangerous plan which will begin costing people's lives if he proves successful.I read this book sometime after I saw the movie in 2004 because I enjoyed it so much. Grisham writes with superb detail that intrigue the reader's psyche. It's all the more entertaining because the author is an experienced lawyer, so one will appreciate the truth in his fictional account of what likely happens behind the scenes. And this makes one a bit unnerved because if this is the case, then what is our judicial system doing (if anything) to prevent such action from tainting a jury? This book is highly recommended and I've kept it for reading again and again like I have some of his other books which are favorites of mine.
