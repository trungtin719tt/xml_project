Usually I do not like when male authors write from the perspective of a female character, especially a strong one. But Paulo Coelho has surprised me yet again with this one. Even though written later, I read 'The Spy' before this one, and found that very interesting. So was this one, to some extent even better. The story of a prostitute that is written without judgement or sympathy - two perspectives that usually ruin a book for me. This is the story of the journey of a woman who was strong and courageous enough for venturing towards an unknown land and occupation to chase her dreams of seeing more. She chose prostitution along the way, but kept her inner spirit alive, taught herself new language and new ways of life, and chased towards her dreams even from this situation. The ending was a bit 'dramatic', yet I liked it. A well written book, did not have to pause to go with the flow. A book I would recommend to everyone, however, not for reading with a conservative mindset. It is a book to be read with the same lack of judgement that it was written with I think :)
