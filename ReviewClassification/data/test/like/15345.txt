As I have been writing sonnets lately, I decided to re-read the works of the genius, the master, of the sonnet form. I was intrigued to understand how Shakespeare suffered in writing his sonnets as a young man not yet established as a dramatist. He was writing under the patronage of a young, handsome, English gent named Southampton, who presented these sonnets to women whom he pursued ardently. The sonnets when read sequentially reveal changes in the young poet's life as he evolves. He competed as a poet among the Cambridge and Oxford educated poets like Marlowe and Spenser whose work was well received by the British upper crust and royalty. Certainly, Spenser's long "Faerie Queen" was well supported by Queen Elizabeth. Marlowe made a play for Southampton's patronage and this competition was a matter of life and death until Marlowe's famous and very public demise, which left Southampton with Shakespeare. But he was only a commoner with a grammar school education who by the age of 23 had a wife and children to feed from his patronage as a poet from Southampton. Indeed, most poets then, as now, were forced to bear their stigmata and suffered from dire poverty as he considered himself "poor but free." The later sonnets were written for his mistress, a "dark lady" with black hair and black eyes who was deemed in the writing as an unscrupulous gentlewoman, possibly even a woman of pleasure but not necessarily a courtesan among the upper classes, including perhaps Southampton. But no one seems to know who she was except from the descriptions in the sonnets themselves. After writing the Sonnets he moved to become a dramatist and incorporated many of his sonnets into the dramatic and comedic texts of his plays. His plays suffered in 1592-93 as audiences were unable to congregate in theatres during those plague years. It was not until he was given by his patron a share of an investment in the Globe that he really began to earn a living wage and his plays began to receive their proper due from early critics who had been unfair in their assessment of his gifts as a writer. He is the master of the Elizabethan Sonnet Form, which is 14 lines of rhyme with an octet and sestet ending in a rhyming couplet: abab, cdcd, efef, gg. There is incredible honesty in his sonnets about his mistress, which seem, at times, to ridicule her rather than, as one would expect, woo her. The pure simplicity of the language is exquisite and the turns of phrases, of course, are genius. Sonnet #18 is a personal favorite as it begins with its famous: "Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?" I thought of Proust while reading Sonnet #30: "When to the sessions of sweet silent thought/ I summon up remembrance of things past/ I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought/ And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste..." I very much appreciate the "turns" of his sonnets where he brings home at the end, often in the last rhyming couplets, the real meaning of the sonnet. For example, in Sonnet #57: "So true a fool is love that in your will / Though you do anything, he thinks no ill." Great Sonnet #116: "Let me not to the marriage of true minds / admit impediments: love is not love/ Which alters when it alteration finds/ or bends with the remover to remove/ o, no! It is an ever-fixed mark/ That looks on tempests and is never shaken." According to Rowse Sonnet #126 of 12 lines in rhymed couplets mark the end of the Southampton sonnet sequence in a more Ovidian style, which influenced him all his life. Shakespeare is smitten to the core in his "Dark Lady Sonnets" but presents a style of which Baudelaire would approve in Sonnet # 150: "If thy unworthiness raised love in me/ More worthy I to be beloved of thee." Finally, in Sonnet #152 his experience with the dark lady comes to an end with "And all my honest faith in thee is lost." At this point Rowse points out that "Art redeems life." The pure beauty of the sonnets largely resides in the elegant simplicity of his language, which is considered a virtue in this literary form. The rhymes are always smooth as silk, unforced and streaming with a literary logic which only a genius could create. If you seek a change of pace from fiction or non-fiction, the Sonnets of Shakespeare will enable you to return to your favorite literary genres refreshed and invigorated by the clarity and beauty of the English language in the hands of a master sonneteer.
