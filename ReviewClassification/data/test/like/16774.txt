Beware of spoilers!This book completely flipped my views on the characters, the plot, the concepts, etc. I cannot believe how much I Pucking love this book.(view spoiler)[See what I did there.(hide spoiler)]It's insane. The characters I used to think of as annoying, clingy, boring, and dull, NOW I LOVE THEM ALL! My excitement for these amazing, dynamic, brilliantly written characters is unfathomable. I don't know how I'm going to write this review. I feel like such a moron because organization just seems like an alien concept to me right now. I just want to fangirl hard.Regardless, I need to get my feelings out for this incredible piece of epic awesomeness.CharactersHolyPuck. How these amazing creatures made me heart melt into a melted pool of Godiva chocolate in this book.Meghan:In the first two books, Meghan was insecure, weak, stupid as hell, and confused in regards to almost everything. She annoyed me in TID so much when she was with Ash. Then she completely made me head-over-heels for her. She changed into a beautiful, determined, incredibly strong fighter who did things that were best for the people she loved. She accepted the fact that not all things can end happily. And that made my heart break. Meghan wanted to be someone, be with her family, go places, do things, and she had to give it all up for the sake of her friends and family. I have respect for such a heroine. Meghan was honest, unafraid, caring, loving, and she never let anything get in the way of her goals. She sacrificed nearly everything for the safety and wellness of a world she barely knew. All her other flaws: her obsession over Ash, her slightly stupid responses or actions towards situations, and her unawareness towards her best friend all seem like nothing. I don't care anymore because Meghan grew to become a fighter, a woman, and a queen. I love her. Props to Kagawa for crafting such a memorable character. Thank you.Ash:Oh, Ash. I thought I would dislike you for the whole series. Your icy-like-the-inside-of-my-freezer personality, your boring, quiet ways of interacting with people, etc made me want to hate you. Then this book comes along and I like you. You won my heart. You changed my views on you.In the first two books, Prince Ash is the emotionless, calculating, callous son of Queen Mab, the emotionless, calculating, callous queen of Winter fey. However, he falls deeply in love with Meghan and a side of him is revealed. When he's around Meghan, he's different. It's cliche, but it's sweet. I must admit. In this book, he completely won my heart when he becomes Meghan's knight. What he said while he was on his knees with his head bowed made me want to read that paragraph at least five times because it was so darn romantic. *sighs* He opened up to Meghan in this book. He became more friendly and sweet. Their romance developed so beautifully, and I loved that. I believed that Ash and Meghan didn't fit, but after reading this book, I am sticking with them. They are meant to be. I was just really angry because Meghan annoyed the crap out of me and Ash was just... Ash. Now I love them together because they are perfect for each other. And that makes me happy.Puck:I loved you from the very beginning, babe. You won my heart at that bus stop when I first met you. You made my heart skip. You made me jump up and down and do happy dances. You made me ponder. You made me smile. You made me laugh. And you complete me.Robin Goodfellow, the beast of mischief, wit, and Summer, lets us see a side of him that he never showed in the first two books. In the first two books, he is Puck. The Puck who is wild, careless, impulsive, witty, and confident. In this book, his love for Meghan grows more. And we see the passionate, hurting, lost Puck. Though it did shatter my heart to see him like that for Meghan, he did make me want to love him even more, if that's even possible. He lets go of Meghan and accepts the fact that only Ash can make her happy, romantically. He lets her go because of Ash, who lost Ariella because of Puck's actions. Ash deserved to be happy and Puck let his feud with him go to hell for the sake of his friendship with Meghan and Ash. I love Puck so much. And I almost cried when he cried for Meghan in the end. However, Puck is happy. That makes me happy. And I am dying to know what happens to him inThe Iron Knight. I want to read about Puck more than I want to read about Ash, despite the fact the the book is written in Ash's perspective.Puck, you could not have Meghan. You still love her, I know that. You might think that no one will love you except Meghan.Youshouldknow thatalt="description"/&gt;SoAnd it's all good, Goodfellow.Grimalkin:I want to honor him by naming my cat Grimalkin. I love Grim so much. His discreet personality, his sly, cunning attitude, his insulting mannerism towards Meghan amazed me. He is fond of Meghan, but shows it in the most bizarre ways."I am a cat."Yes, you are. And a beastly one at that.This series was a hell of a ride. I recommend this to everyone! I do understand the first two books are a bit cliche and dragging, BUT BUT BUT! This book will reward you with its epicness! It's incredible. It will change you. I'm telling you. Siriusly. I am done. *sighs* I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. Oh, I will.
