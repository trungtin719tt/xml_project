A wonderfully wacky selection of tales. Scieszka so effortlessly twists the traditional to the strange and unconventional, sprinkled with just the right amount of humour for good measure. The narrative defies all kind of order and would be a superb postmodern picturebook to use within KS1 and LKS2. From characters taking control, overwhelming the rather intrusive narrator and popping up in stories where they do not belong, all structure is lost and the book becomes carnage in the best kind of way.
