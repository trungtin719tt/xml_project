My absolute favorite Sookie stackhouse to date. A lot of stuff happens in this book, but towards the end the action is great and goes somewhere you weren't really sure Ms. Harris would take you. Sookie travels to a Vampire Summit with Queen Sophie-Ann's entourage, which lends to some hilarious moments with different vamps and the fangbangers at their side. Like I said before, there is a lot more action then in previous books which is just exciting. Plus Quinn and Eric play for sookie's interest. When I started reading this series I was afraid it would follow the same old formula every time, but thats not really the case here and i'm glad. Charlaine Harris is building great stories one on top of the other and they are surely going to lead to something great.
