I was introduced to this book since i watched the film first, and thought it was beautiful. This book didn't dissapoint me, it had beauty and love. Some may say its unbelivable or incourages teenage pregancy, since all ends well. But i don't believe thats true this book is about the good and bad in life, how sometimes a bad situation that looks like it will never get better, can be the begginning. A start to someones history, a start to someones life, a chance to become someone new. I related to this book, and i'm only 15 and i could see the wisdom and advice this book gives you, i could relate to the teenage Novalee Nation, she was knocked down and abandoned so many times and still found the best in people, she never lost hope that the next time would be differnet, the next person would be the right one to trust, some say its a naive belief but doesnt it also show courage, that this teenage girl counld still find it in her heart to trust those who offered help.I admire that in her, and the others in her life, they all gave chances to people who may not deseve them, its something that sometime i wish i could do, trust those who i should. The book shows that some people are bad and some are good, but sometimes theres a time to trust, time to understand, to forgive. To help someone get home, or let some else help you, to build a home or to go home.Because after all Home is Where the Heart is.
