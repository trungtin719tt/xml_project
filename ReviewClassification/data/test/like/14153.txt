If God is anything like a middle-class white chick from the suburbs, which i admit is a long shot, it's what you do about what feel that matters.(4.25?) This was a beautiful and heart wrenching book. The characters were attaching and you can't help but root for them... but also cry with them. An interesting take on the first contact with alien trope.
