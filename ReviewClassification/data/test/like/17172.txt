Fabulous! For some reason I thought this book was set in the 70s, rather than the 50s and 60s. Divas, drug abuse, affairs and bitch slapping, wigs flushed down loos. Neely, wow, what a piece of work! This book is set in the last glory days of the big Broadway and Hollywood stars and their demise with the advent of Hollywood. I felt really sorry for Jennifer and more so for Anne and sad that she got bitten by the bug in the end as well. What a story! My friend Jay tells me this is a lightly disguised fiction of Judy Garland and Ethel Merman, which sent me straight to Wiki to read up. Fascinating stuff.
