Was it everything I wanted it to be? Was I satisfied with the book?For all of those who know me and have been following my reviews, you know this series is my top fav and an absolute obsession! I have read so many books, specially paranormal and UF! And this is still my fav of them all. I have adored this series since book 1. I'm ashamed to admit I was terrified I wouldn't like this book for several reasons, specially because Barrons could not be much in it.I don't wanna write any spoilers so all I can say is that this book was everything I wanted it to be, but what I liked the most was that it kept real to what the other books had been. There was not a freaking lame ending, things ended just exactly how they had to. What I adored the most about this series was the way the books were written, KMM has such an amazing and unique style and you just can't help to love it. Now that I am finally done with the series I can say it is still my top fav and I adored every page in every book. For all of those who have been waiting for book 5 to get released before starting the series, start right away because you're gonna adore it.Am I sad because it's over?Hell yeah, but at the same time I love an author who knows when to finish a series. I hate when series go on and on and you know they should have finished so many books ago. This was the perfect ending and KMM did it with style, she created a piece of art. This series is just too good to be true, she created a new world because it's so much more than books!
