A work of wonder displaying the naivete' and mistakes of youth and some Americans' missteps in life choices that were driven by gullible and romantic notions of and in Europe. The novel still feels fresh and timely.I was driven from this novel, after beginning it a few years back, by both its bulk and by my dislike ofWashington Square(see, if you will,my caustic review of both the book and the author). I am pleased to have returned toThe Portrait of a Lady, so that, finally, I canappreciate the depth of character and psychological acuity of Henry James' writing.As much as I dislikedWashington Square(and was unimpressed by his novellaThe Beast in the Jungle), I prized this esteemed classic of fiction. I might even return a number of his novels to my TBR list.
