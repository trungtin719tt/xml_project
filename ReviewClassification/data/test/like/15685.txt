What a delightful surprise! This book was not at all what I thought it was before I cracked the spine, or rather I should say, inserted the CD, as I listened to the audio. It is an epistolary novel, written as a series of diary entries spanning a 20 year period in the life of the author's great-grandmother. Sarah Agnes Prine was an early settler in the Arizona territory.As I live in Arizona, I was thrilled with the references to places and things I know. Even the narrator's mispronunciation of certain Arizona words like Prescott (it's PressCut not PressScott) and Fort Huachuacha (it's Fort Wahchewka, not Fort Whoachewka) could not ruin it for me. I also thought the narrator's male voice was not especially masculine. No matter.At it's essence, it is a love story, and for those fans of Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series, this is one of the closest I have found in historical detail, portrayal of a masculine hero, strong female protagonist, and emotional wallop. I drove the freeway in tears this morning as I listened to the conclusion. I can give no better recommendation than that.The best part is it's the first book in a trilogy.
