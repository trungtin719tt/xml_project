I actually, started this book long back but due to some unknown reasons I left it in the middle, but once I resumed I found it very much interesting!! It is indeed a powerful legal story, which introduces the legal system of America to foreigners!!The Runaway Jury is an intensely suspensefullegal thriller. I could feel my heart pounding asI read the last pages of the book. I wasmesmerized by Grisham's narration. The booktackles a lot of important points aboutcigarette smoking which make the story moreinteresting. All Grisham's novels are more or less of the same interesting plot with some legal additives and thrilling points.
