Again, Grisham shines in this legal thriller, that I want to immediately pick up his next book on my list...But I resist the temptation, as I know I will be sick of legal sta\uff halfway through it. Maybe after a couple of other books...The story makes one question his/her own sense of right or wrong, at least it did a bit for me. There's really a blurred line (so they say), and one's philosophies, principles, and values in life are the factors that will influence a person's inclination. The plot weaves an almost unbelievable web of deceit not only from the defense and the plaintiff, but from inside the jury itself. It is a major orchestration of a con that is not completely a con, for the reason that the money was returned; but of course after it was used to capitalize on "inside" trading of stocks.For whatever it's worth, I enjoyed this book immensely, and in the end, that counts a lot.
