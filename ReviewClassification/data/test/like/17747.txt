This book gave me troubles in pre-school. It must have been some kind of Montessori situation, I'm not sure. All I can remember is that if I pretended that I could not read well then I would be with the kids whose nap-time involved back rubs. If I could read well then I was allowed into the room with all of the books (including this one, which I more or less wanted to read every day), but nap-time was governed by some awful person who did not rub backs. I was forced to choose between pretending to be dull but receiving back rubs and giving up back rubs but being allowed to read GDG every day). Such was my introduction to the imperfections of this world.
