Finally!! This is the kind of book I wanted from Mr. Sparks!! The difference between this and his other books (I read til date) is all books started peacefully and ended with tragedy but here it is vice versa!!The emotional bondage between the lead characters during their different times was narrated so touchingly!! And yeah there is always the sparks kind of romance which is always a worth read!! The death of his wife and the repercussions were narrated in a wonderful way!! The pinch of sentiment, as usual in sparks' books, is a bit on higher note yet it is required for this subject!!This plot is a mixed narration, sometimes first person and sometimes third person!! The relation of the third person with the leads will be revealed slowly once the plot begins to thicken!!On the whole this is a different kind of work , narration wise!! A worth read and definitely a page turner!!
