Thank you Nicholas Sparks for the heart attack you almost caused me with that ending! I was this close ( ) to lose my mind over Logan.It's a beautiful story, beautifully written, and very enjoyable, it evokes faith, luck, destiny, all gathered in a former marine's life, and his journey to accomplish what had started in his life because of a photograph.IDK why! But I always find Sparks' stories so enjoyable, like they keep one's mind away from his own crap, and make it wander away in the era and place where the told story is taking place.I liked it, I actually loved it, I also loved Logan's character, boy, was he amazing! And I found myself sticking my tongue like a child at Keith in different parts of the book.
