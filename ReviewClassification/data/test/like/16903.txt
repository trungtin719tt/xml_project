Kindle freebie 12/7/16Evernightis a YA paranormal romance. Just understand that going in. If you dislike that genre, it's unlikely that this'll be the book to change your mind. If youdoenjoy PNRs, I think this is one of the better novels I've read of its sort. My reasons for liking this one better than most are extremely spoilerish. Really, I enjoyed it much more going into it blind than I would have(view spoiler)[if I'd known there was a twist coming. I wasn't expecting a twist so it totally cold-cocked me. I thought my world had been turned upside-down for a few pages. Yes, the twist was a bit of a cheat--the author was certainly hiding the ball--but I enjoyed it so much that I forgive her.(hide spoiler)]Seriously, if you're interested in this book, don't read moreEvernightreviews, andreallydon't go reading the synopsesorany reviews for the later books. Just go into this one cold and enjoy it for what it is.Just a word of warning: even though this book wasn't quite the usual run of the mill PNR, you've still got to deal with a YA romance in the oh-he's-so-hot-and-wonderful-and-if-I-can't-be-with-him-I-think-I'm-going-to-die sort of vein. I didn't mind it too much here, but it gets old fast. Also: Balthazar?(view spoiler)[Way better choice. I'm just sayin'. Even though the idea that he would seriously have been interested in our young and callow MC was a little too much disbelief for me to swallow.(hide spoiler)]Since I pretty regularly fail to take my own advice, I went and dug through the blurbs and reviews for the rest of the books in this series (at least I did finish this book first), and I think I'm just going to quit with this book, even though this book's ending does kind of leave you hanging. I'll just have to imagine my own ending for the series.
