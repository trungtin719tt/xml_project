What a terrific supense novel by Denis Lehane. Even though I had seen the movie many years ago I had always wanted to read the book and was so glad I did as I had forgotten the plot anyhow and the book proved to be so well written and intriguing that it had me on the edge of my seat.The novel is set of the Massachusette's coast in an army facility turned hopital for the criminally insane. This book is full of twists and turns and really packs a punch. I loved the fact theat the author at the very begining of the story plunges the reader right in and you really get caught up in the drama of shutter Island right from the onset.I dont want to give too much away about this truly absorbing book but I did loose myself in the characters and the happenings on the Shutter Island. Its a novel thats is well paced and thought out and certainly well worth a read.
