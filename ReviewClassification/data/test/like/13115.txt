Must quote from the back of the book, as I love it :)We, the Sisterhood, hereby instate the following rules to govern the use of the Traveling Pants:2. You must never double-cuff the Pants. It's tacky. There will never be a time when this will not be tacky.4. You must never let a boy take off the Pants (although you may take them off yourself in his presence).5. You must not pick your nose while wearing the Pants. You may, however, scratch casually at your nostril while really kind of picking.I have to say it. I loved this book! I've been putting off my book review because frankly, it's like writing a book report on a great movie or dream.I love the idea of The Septembers, a bunch of girls all born at the same time. Maybe it's special to me because *I'm* a September.These girls are friends their entire lives (well to age 15, at least), and that too is something that touches me. My dad was in the Air Force and we moved a lot. I don't have any friends who have known me since birth, and I've always been jealous of people who do.For a book written for teens, there are some beautifully written passages, and some very insightful sections. This author doesn't "talk down" to the reader at all. I love the description of Lena's sunset in Greece: "The sunset was too beautiful. It almost made Lena feel panicked because she couldn't save it. . . . She perched on her windowsill, gazing at the lurid sun soaking into the Caldera, trying to appreciate it even though she couldn't have it. Why did she always feel she had todosomething in the face of beauty?" I had two thoughts when I read this -- 1. that I often feel the same way in the face of beauty, and 2. this makes me think of people who take pictures (for the future), but don't enjoy the moment they are actually taking the pictures of.Another passage that said exactly something I have felt many times: "Her eyes were full. They dripped. From sadness, or strangeness, or love. They were the kind of tears that came when she was just too full. She needed to make a little room." Do you know this feeling? Wow, I do. What a wonderful way to write it.SPOILER ALERT:When Tibby's pet dies and Tibby is in denial, it requires some processing to realize Mimi is gone. "Tibby held her up high, in one hand. Mimi hated that. She usually scrambled her sharp little nails against Tibby's wrist. Dawning on her both slowly and panic-fast was the knowledge that this wasn't Mimi anymore. This was left-over Mimi." OH, how I know what this means! I wanted to see my dad's body after he died, but when I saw him, it was somehow unfulfilling. It was left-over dad, I think.When her friend Bailey dies too, Brashares writes the most beautiful tribute for the living: "She was alive, and they were dead. She had to try to make her life big. As big as she could. She promised Bailey she would keep playing." This is a fabulous challenge for those of us who have lost someone. What a charge! We must go on living. And live big :)This is a great book! I laughed, I cried.
