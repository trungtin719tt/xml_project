A quick re-read for an SRC task.A very sweet story about a teenager discarded by those who should care for her (parents, boyfriend who is the father of her baby, etc). Instead, Novalee makes a family for herself out of the misfits in a small Oklahoma town. The setting feels very nailed into the Oklahoma landscape in a way thatThe Readers of Broken Wheel Recommenddoes not. I originally picked this up in undergrad because the hook - pregnant Novalee somehow manages to live inside the Wal-Mart where she is abandoned by said awful boyfriend - caught my attention and I was looking for an escape from MCATs and biochem exams. A good summer read if you're starting to look for beach reads.
