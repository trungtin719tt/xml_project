Basic plot: Dogs doing things!I know it isn't really a plot, but the book doesn't really have one. This book uses simple repetition and clear pictures to teach kids about prepositions (under, over, in, on, etc), sizes, and a few other basic concepts. The pictures are funny and have lots of details to talk about with little ones beyond the words on the page. There's a lot of good repeat factor in there because of this. I took this book on a 2-week vacation with my 5-year old and read it almost every night, picking a different page to describe more fully each night. It's also a much longer book than a lot of other picture books designed for kids. It keeps attention, though, reminding us adults that kids can have an attention span beyond a few seconds if the text is worthwhile! A few older-than-me (60-something) campmates seemed quite tickled that this book was still being read. There is a reason why Eastman ranks up with Seuss in staying power of the books written. :) Those books are quality stuff that every child should read.
