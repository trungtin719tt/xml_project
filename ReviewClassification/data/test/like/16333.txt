*My first experience with Paolo Coelho wasn't so flattering, The Alchemist didn't live up for the hype for me. I said to myself I should pick up another novel since he has too many and they are all successful. .and I'm so glad I did. This particular novel is the perfect mixture of hating and loving a novel it's full of turns and twists that not all readers would tolerate, However, and regardless of the intensity of the topics, I found it an eye-opening. The exposur On women's anatomy would help the other gender, and women themselves, to understand better the physical intercourse. At least you will end up learning a lot about what worked and how when... u know what I mean.The Author was very smart with how the story collided, and How the main character developed to become who she was. I also found it clever how he chose to call her Maria, which is basically Mary the virgin whereas the protagonist was ironically a prostitute, speaking of which, you will have a brief history about prostitution and sex in general that you never imagined existed.(Although I don't think this will stick to my mind to represent a standard Brazilian girl) I can think of more to say but I'd rather not. I must mention the fluency of the story which was a page-turning. And some slightly boring parts that were repetitive. Over all a ne pas rater.
