Having seen many movie versions of this famous book , I thought it was finally time to read the book this (time of) year and I did!How talented Dickens was... to invent this story and write it in beautiful language. Maybe I'll reread it again by Christmas time next year, so much detail there, deserves great attention, and my good intention will be to read more Dickens in the time to come. A delightful book, a very talented writer, so long ago... A magical story, famous for its moral and 'advice in life', capturing the hearts of people young and old...and through times it will always stay that way.And so, as Tiny Tim observed, God bless Us, Every One!
