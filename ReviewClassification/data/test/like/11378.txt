From what I understand, this book created a lot of controversy...so to speak. I have read several reviews, and have seen posts crying out for JR Ward to re-write this book. That Vishous was cheated out of a mate...they hate/or hate that Jane ended up like she did.I am not one of those people. I really loved this book. Yes, it is not the easy happily ever after that we are used to, but dang...it was still good.Plus, I know that everything happens for a purpose with this series...there is a REASON that it ended the way it did. (I am really trying not to spoil anything...lol)I thought Vishous and Jane were a very compelling couple. Honestly, I really never cared for Vishous before. He was not my favorite Brother (I have a thing for Rhage, Wrath and Phury...oh hell I love them all)...and his obvious feelings for Butch in the previous novels didn't really give me the impression he was going to find a female mate that would be suitable for him.Personally, after reading this book I found that Vishous is probably the most tortured, misunderstood brother to date. The things he endured and the scars he bares because the the cruelty that was unleashed on him was unbearable...no wonder he was so untrusting of others.Jane was perfect for him. She is smart, sarcastic and sees Vishous as he is. I really loved them together, and once again the character development was well thought out. They both changed, they grew together and I loved how their relationship developed.I simply loved this book, and I can't WAIT to read PHURY'S...ugh that man...er vampire...drives me crazy!I am really curious to see what y'all thought of this one. Did you love it like me, or were you disappointed???
