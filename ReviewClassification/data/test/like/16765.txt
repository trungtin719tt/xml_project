If you're into stuff like this,you can read the full review.On this re-reading I noticed that the word "brave" was used a few times in the movies that I watched (Taymor, 2010 &amp; Jarman 1979).I like this word. It generates a very good feeling in my heart. This word often makes me think of someone who has a quality to face something difficult with the strength of heart / mind / body... Does not take me much to feel a respect and admiration for this person...I also come to know that the word "brave" describes something wonderful, admirable in appearance...And I just got curious to see how often the word "brave" was used in "The Tempest". And I started reading the play to look for the word "brave" and "bravely", and every time I found one of these words, I put a post-it note to the page to keep track of it... No, I did not use any fancy software to sort out the words or count the words... The work was done manually... Though I tried to be as faithful and accurate as possible, there might be a few occasions that I missed finding these words...It looks like there are 11 occasions that the words "Brave" or "Bravely" were mentioned...The rest of this review can be found elsewhere.
