The first book of the Bourne trilogy series, The Bourne Identity begins the tale of Jason Bourne, one of the US government's greatest assassin creations, rescued by fishermen off the French coast. The only problem is that the incident that put him adrift in the water, bullet-ridden and unconscious, had resulted in amnesia. He does not know his name nor his profession. He only knows what his body has been trained to do. The adventure starts, and can only start, with the only piece of information Jason Bourne has...a Swiss bank account number, found imprinted on a minute negative surgically implanted in his hip. With only that to go on to find his true identity, Jason heads to Switzerland. What he finds there leads him to the beginning of a non-stop race to find out who he really is, who he works for and most importantly, a race for his life as others are determined to kill him. He begins to piece together information about himself, his past and his employer...and ultimately learns too fast the deception, betrayal and danger involved in espionage. I loved this book, an absolute thriller. So much so that I jumped right into the sequel, The Bourne Supremacy. Ironically, the entire Bourne movie trilogy is solely based on this first book, not the other two.
