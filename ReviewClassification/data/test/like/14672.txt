I started The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo back in February of this year, and for the first time in years, I read right through this and the other two books in the Trilogy (The Girl Who Played with Fire and The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest). So I must give these books my highest recommendation. Why? Mainly because Stieg Larsson has created the most unforgettable character in fiction since who knows when. For me, probably since Elizabeth Bennett. Will you like these books? If you like very complicated, detailed characters (and many many of them), a complicated espionage story, and fairly good writing that is both plot and character driven, I think you will. Since I am absolutely NO fan of The Twilight books, J.D. Rowling books, Nicholas Sparks or Dan Brown, if you liked these books, you may not particularly like these books, but who knows? You might. 48 million and counting are devouring these books around the world. (And don't miss the films - the undubbed Swedish versions, not the soon to be completed US version which I am expecting to be typically zipped up American movies without the subtle deliberate context of European films.)
