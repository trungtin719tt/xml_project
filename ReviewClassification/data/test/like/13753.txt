I never watched the movie, but from what I've heard and seen in other reviews the book and movie are two entirely separate things only joined by a title. That being said, I loved this book so much that I probably will never watch the movie.Forrest Gump is an idiot, but an idiot who has had more adventures than I could dream of. He has gone to college on a football scholarship, fought in Vietnam, and went on to start his own business. He did manage to get into a few scrapes along the way, but always had a friend or a new government program to bail him out.I don't think I laughed as much with any other book as I did with Forrest Gump. I found every situation he was in hilarious, despite being entirely unlikely. The book takes so many twists and turns, and it's great to constantly be on your toes. And I think where he ends up in the end couldn't be any more perfect.I really recommend this book to everyone. It is a light and easy read, and it's just perfect to curl up with in this cold weather.
