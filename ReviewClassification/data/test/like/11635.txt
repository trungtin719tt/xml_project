ReadingThe Maguswas like holding a mirror up to my life, not knowing who it is I'm looking at, not fully understanding where I am or where I've been, and even less certain of where I am going -- not certain of what lessons I've learned or am supposed to be learning, adrift and perplexed about issues of morality/immorality/amorality, not wholly certain if the things I seek and desire aren't already right here in front of me.I think it's safe to say thatThe Maguswas one of the most profoundly amazing reading experiences of my life.And I say this in total agreement with all its naysaysers who say that the story is preposterous, not credible, frustrating, ever-changing, too self-satisfied in how it pulls and yanks the reader around and leads him/her into blind alleys, traps, promises never intending to be kept. Maurice Conchis, the enigmatic puppetmaster of the tale, is the alter ego of Fowles; leading the bewildered protagonist, Nicholas Urfe, in the same epochal, mind-fucking game that Fowles the author does with the reader. The mind-meld one has with Urfe, and just as surely, the disconnect one has with him, is a process one has throughout the book, mirroring one's own self examination and self-loathing.I'm no intellectual literary critic, plus I'm a little lazy, so there won't be any pondering of the various philosophical, mythological, psychological, political, sociological questions raised inThe Magus, of which there are innumerable examples. The question of what freedom is, and how we choose to use it, looms large over the book, as do notions of life as a kind of theater. References and parallels to ancient myth, drama and to Shakespeare are interwoven liberally. Perception and reality, the nature of time and memory, science vs. metaphysics and much more are tackled herein.As I read it, I thought of the many other books and media products that influenced it, and in turn, it influenced. The Englishman abroad motifs reminded me a bit of Graham Greene. I detected similarities with other books, The Castle of Communion, The Most Dangerous Game, Zorba the Greek, Alice Through the Looking Glass, The Tempest, The Sporting Club, the Saragossa Manuscript, Lord of the Flies, Dream Story (and its movie version, Eyes Wide Shut), and TV shows such as The Prisoner, Lost, and even The Wild Wild West,and movies such as The Game.The book is a fascinating, one-of-a-kind tour de force.There will be no attempt at plot summary here. That is easily enough gotten at Wikipedia or in other reviews. Another aspect of the mirroring between protagonist and reader is the idea of willing submission, of suspension of disbelief. It's Urfe's own curiosity that draws him to the game and his own willingness to stay with it. The question of whether or not we are our own jailer comes to mind.Oh, and the book is also intensely romantic. Filled with regret and longing and anger and despair. The Greek island setting is enigmatic and intoxicating.If you're someone who wants a tidy ending,The Maguswill not be for you. For all of us, the future is mute. The book understands this.
