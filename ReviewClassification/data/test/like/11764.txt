One of the best Non Fiction Memoir I have ever read till date. A gripping tale of inhuman tortures, an endless story of survival, a brutal fate after escaping each and every prison before recapturing again, horrific days and nights with the other deadly prisoners, surviving in the infirmary without food and water for several days counting the each and last second which gonna pass by very slowly.All the above cruel conditions were for innocent Henry Charrier affectionately known as Papillon - A butterfly. He got arrest for the crime of murder which he did not committed and sent to the jail.The story of Papillon is the gripping tale of his survival through the inhuman conditions for life in the prisons, his collaborations with the other jail inmates, his plans for escapes, his travels through seas to reach the new shores by hiding with the coast guards, his relations with the leprosy affected prisoners and with the Indian tribes.All the happenings with the Papillon left you stunned, dumb founded and awestruck. The story revolves around one motive only : an escape.Awesomely written, extremely well narrated the Papillon make you to fall in Love of him. Strongly recommendable to every book lover to read at least once, not only for an interests but to know how a Memoir and a Non Fiction should be.Cheers !! ..
