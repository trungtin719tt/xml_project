Okay, I've been schooled. For lo these many years, I've prided myself on being one of the original Stephen King fans, the quintessential Constant Reader. I grew up with him, meaning that I am of an age that I read his books as he actually churned them out. I was there, hands outstretched, waiting for each eagerly anticipated tome, ready to devour it and add to my ever-growing admiration for the god of horror--except for the Dark Tower series. I can't even offer a satisfactory explanation for this dichotomy. Maybe because the first installment was calledThe Gunslinger? I've never had much interest in books of a Western bent (except forLonesome Dove, that genre-transcending masterpiece) and I can't explain this irrational prejudice either. What's not to like about the West? The development of the West is the history of our country surging ahead, conquering new territories, a hardy, courageous people willing to abandon everything they know to carve a life for themselves in an unforgiving, hostile terrain. This flimsy excuse is the only one I can think of.So, I have discovered the true depths of my idiocy by reading this book. This is what I get for questioning Uncle Stevie. When will I learn? I have avoided this series for years, and I loved this book! It starts off with freakin' awesome action in the prologue, and the tension escalates from there. Roland's story, which put-putts along sedately in the first book, takes off like a rocket in this book. We see Roland, unconscious on the beach, and the next thing we know he's involved in a life-and-death struggle with a weird lobster creature. I mean, let's face it, just regular lobsters and crabs are creepy looking, but these are like lobsters on steroids. After he survives this (but not without serious injury), Roland sets off to locate the people who will assist him in his quest for the Tower. The scene with Eddie in the airplane bathroom is incredibly tense and had me yelling at the book for them to "hurry up!" The scenes with Odetta/Detta ware equally suspenseful since you never know when the situation will take a sharp turn for the savage. Roland's "resolution" of Jack Mort is a thing of beauty, and resolves more than just Jack Mort.The introduction of our world into the book, with Roland able to step into and explore our culture, creates a link for the reader to identify with. There are humorous moments as Roland attempts to comprehend the unfamiliar jargon and behaviors of 20th century America, such as "tooter-fish" sandwiches and "astin," the magical drug (aspirin) that temporarily relieves Roland's pain and fever. It also gives you an appreciation for those amenities we so take for granted. It is run-of-the-mill 20th century medicine that saves Roland's life. It reminds me of Owen Wilson inMidnight in Paris, earnestly explaining why he cannot stay in the 1920's despite his love for the period, "I dreamed I went to the dentist and he didn't have novocain . . . these people don't have antibiotics!"Overall, I was on the edge of my seat for the entire read, and can't wait to start the next book. I will never doubt Uncle Stevie again, I promise!
