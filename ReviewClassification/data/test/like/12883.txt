I love, love, love this book! I loved it so much that when I finished it.This was such a wonderful book, funny and meaningful and smart and emotional. A character-driven story about two people, Emma and Dexter, it focuses on their lives and relationship over a span of twenty years. The format was really original - each chapter taking place on July 15th of a particular year - and I thought that worked really well and set the story apart from other contemporary romances.
