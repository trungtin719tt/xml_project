I read this in preparation for readingHome Fireby Kamila Shamsie from this year's Man Booker longlist.And I read in a different translation to the edition shown here, one sticking more literally to the original Greek, including not translating terms where it felt there was no satisfactory equivalent. This was important in clarifying some of the key themes, but rather puts the onus of interpretation back on the reader (and this reader is no expert in ancient Greek philosophy).A number of things struck me in the differing views of Antigone and Creon which have modern day relevance, and which I suspect will also feature in Home Fire.- the ambiguous use of the wordnomos- which to Antigone denotes customs and values, and to Creon the laws of the land (and, in this context, his laws) [https://www.britannica.com/topic/nomo...]- similarly Antigone's appeal to the rules of the gods, rather than those of the state/ruler- Antigone's prioritisation ofphilia(obligations to friends, family:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Philia) over obligations to the state, and Creon's explicit rejection of that stance:Whoever deems a philos more important than a fatherland, this man I say is nowhere.or in Seamus Heaney's rewrite of the play, which forms the epigraph for Home Fire:The ones we love . . . are enemies of the state.- and most strikingly in a 2016-7 context Antigone's lament that she is ametic, not among the living nor among the dead(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metic). In modern day parlance, she is essentially proclaiming herself acitizen of nowhere, in the accusatory phrase used in the most offensive and inflammatory speech given by a British prime minister in my lifetime.This has left me eagerly awaiting my copy of Home Fire.
