It's been a couple of years now since I read this book; which I find to be amazing because I still think about this novel all the time.It has spurred so many conversations regarding nature vs. nurture, I couldn't even count them all.One thing I did learn from this tale was that I could absolutely LOVE a book without liking any of the characters in it. Previously, I didn't think that was possible. Now I know that it is.I highly recommend this story to horror fans, especially those that love psychological horror. You will be thinking about it for months or years to come, I guarantee it.
