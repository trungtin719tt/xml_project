I'm not sure how I stumbled across this picture board book for kids, but was delighted from the first page to the last. First published in 1936, this is one of those classics that is relevant in any era and at any age. I love books that don't talk down to kids, and the black and white pen and ink art is lovely. A heart warming message of being true to yourself, and the peace and happiness that comes with that. Delightful.
