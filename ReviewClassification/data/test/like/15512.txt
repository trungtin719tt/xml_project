I've loved this poem since college. I re-read it again today and it still amazes me. Perhaps in a different light now. So many of the lines just stick with you and as apt as they are for the poem, can be interpreted to apply to so many facets of life.- "Water, Water Everywhere / And all the boards did shrink / Water, Water Everywhere / Nor any Drop To Drink" ... I can't help but think of global warming when I read this. We have everything on our planet but the resources are shrinking and soon we will be left surrounded with everything but have nothing.- "Alone, alone, all, all alone / Alone on a wide wide sea! / And never a saint took pity on / My soul in agony." ... I think these words just speak for themseleves! If ever you have felt alone in this world - and I think if we are honest with ourselves, we all have at some point or another - can you think of better words to sum up what you were feeling? The utter despair just oozes from the page.The poem itself holds special meaning for me as I think it does for most who read it. The mariner can be faulted, I daresay evil, and tormented, and alone but still survive. Haunted by the experience but better for it in some regards because he has lived to tell the tale and is sentenced to impress upon others the importance of "loveth best / All things, both great and small." It harkens to the repenting for one's sins biblical concept. That his crew of 200 has to die for him to find salvation can be a hard thing for me to reconcile but they are sealed to their fate as soon as their Captain - the Mariner - kills the albatross. I just kind of look at that as the price one pays for willingly going into servitude on a ship.In any case, it's a great poem - everyone should read it and I'm guessing you, too, will find there are at least parts of it that resonate with you as well.
