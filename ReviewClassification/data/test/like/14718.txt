John and Xhex are officially my favorite couple and this is up there with my favorite books in the series (although on reflection Lover Avenged retains the top spot for the overall story). I must admit that I had a lot of expectations and a lot of theories going into this one - and while the expectations were more than met, very little of it went down quite the way I was expecting it to go. There were a lot of interesting developments - and while I'm not sure how I feel about all of them, it definitely left me anxious for Payne's story. It was definitely an emotional read. Not surprisingly, Xhex and John brought me to tears on more than one occasion, and probably not surprisingly either, so did Qhuinn and Blay. Heck, even Tohr had me welling up. Bless... Basically, I loved it and can't wait to see what Ward comes up with next, as I think she's unmatched in the PNR genre for character depth and world building!
