Great observations, but personally I think it's overrated. It practically begs the reader to come to the conclusion that if you don't "get it" it's your own fault because you're a "grown up, and only kids can see what matters." It's heavy handed, clumsily executed observations on what's important in life. It's not wrong by any means, but it's kind of pseudo-intellectualist.I'm going to go with a literal interpretation of the plot, because it's more fun that way:A man crashes his plane in the desert, hallucinates a small alien boy that teaches him philosophical lessons, invents a history for him, finds a well just in time to stave off dehydration, as he re-hydrates, his hallucinated alien friend kills himself and disappears, he fixes his plane and flies home and is sad about it, but feels blessed for the experience as it has changed him.Ready for the moral? It's really simple:"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important." Or in other words, spend your time developing relationships, don't worry so much about the things, they're not important, it's the time you spend and how you spend it that is.That's a nice philosophy, I get it.
