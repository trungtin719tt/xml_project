I can say that Maggie still showed her talent of writing beautifully in this novel, the way she wrote it was really really good that it made the book tolerable despite its flaws. The book for me was okay it could be amazing but my problem with the book was it's completely plotless, plotless, plotless, and it was also extremely slow in pace.I think the last part of the book was the only one that makes sense that I thought finally that...okay, somehow it has a plot and probably I would still be reading the last book.I don't know, it's just while reading this it's like nothing was really happening until the last part when finally something happened. And the additional characters Cole and Isabel...I really don't get them, I really didn't feel like they have chemistry or whatever.But still it's really okay for me, because for most parts it didn't give the feeling of excitement. The book was more on romance than action and the conflict mostly was with Sam and Grace's parents which I don't buy. I also felt that when something like supernatural like being a werewolf and then it would be explained scientifically somehow it became unrealistic and surely it will contain major plot holes. I just didn't get the theory yet it seems hard to believe and it was also not explain very well.But if you like Shiver, it's okay to read it, just don't have high expectations so you'd not be disappointed.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Wow this book series has excellent beautiful book covers. Love the title!
