I really don't know why I picked this up. I came across it while perusing Goodreads update feed and thought I'll give it a try. And now that I finished the read, I can say that I have read Candide by Voltaire. That seems all I could say about it.However, I'll give a summery for those who would be interested in reading the book. The story is about Candide and his journey through so many adventures and perils in the hope of being reunited with his love. The writing is full of satire and Voltaire's criticism against society, the governments of Europe, aristocrats, the philosophers, Christians, Jews, Muslims, poets, slavery, wars and what not, can be seen throughout the story.But unfortunately, the story didn't go well with me. I found it for the most part boring and nonsensical. There was satire alright, but its deliverance was at times unrefined. I don't know if that was due to the translation I read. I have had the same issue as to writing in many French translations I have read. Anyhow, I didn't enjoy it as much as I expected, but I'm glad that I managed to read it through.
