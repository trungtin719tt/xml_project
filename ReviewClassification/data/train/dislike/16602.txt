It's funny how you forget about a book. I read this when it first came out 10 years ago and thought it was a fast, fluffy read, but nothing else really stuck w/ me. Then, I saw the movie and thought "I know it's been a while, but I really don't remember all this happening" - so, when I saw the book on the charity table, I figured it's only a quid, why not.Criminey, the things you forget - like what a whiney and generally unlikeable person the main character is. She bitches, she moans and she essentially steals from the company and we're supposed to like her?? It's the "something for nothing" mentality that really drags the book down - she seems to think that she can do a year as an admin and it's worth 3 years anywhere else - but somehow, that isn't going to involve work.I'll finish it, but I'll also put it back on the charity pile w/o a backwards glance.
