1 StarGeeeeez.This was quite the YA train wreck.And I probably should have known better.But, I saw this on the library shelf...its protective and majestic plastic library jacket just gleaming with promises of fantastical wonder...and I was drawn in like the total sucker I am.But then reality hit.Sigh.This thing was about 100 pages too long...while still simultaneously feeling like it was 100 pages too short of actualinformation.You know, "INFORMATION," AKA...WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK IS GOING ONThe "mystery" of what/who Daniel and all the other keys players in this thing are were withheld until the last 30 pages of this 420+ page jackfest, and not only that, but I felt like we were moving at the pace of molasses.High viscous molasses.Traveling uphill.On carpet.I meanFUCK, come on.I don't know if I should beat my own ass forstartingthis...Beat my own ass even harder forfinishingthis...Or just call it a day and straight off myself over the fact that I am actually considering reading book two.Find me at:
