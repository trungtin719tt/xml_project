Allen Ginsberg typifies the beat generation. Basically, a large amount of stoned/drunk pretentious hipsters who claimed they hated hipsters. And without much writing skill at that. The only exception to this is Jack Kerouac, who was actually a good writer, and did claim numerous times that he was not a beat. That being said, Howl is one of the longest, most terrible pieces of rubbish I've read in a long time. This deserves less than one star. I must admit, he does manage to incorporate a fair amount of energy into this, using the constant repetition of words, oftentimes striking ones such as "holy". (Gasps) This really seems to be more than a long kvetch more than anything. In my opinion, if you're going to kvetch, then at least incorporate some skill in it. In short, Allen, we know society is decaying, people are destroying their lives, and that you smoke marijuana every chance you get. It's really not helping your cause to write a terrible, tedious, poem about it. Also, who really cares? I pose this question towards you.[The best minds of your generation most likely thought Howl was terrible.:]
