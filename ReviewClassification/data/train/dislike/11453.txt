Book, you deserve to be hit over the head, nothing more, nothing less.(Link:http://vampirekiki.deviantart.com/art...)Note: I read the Chinese translation of this book, won't bother to pick up the English text.I would have given this book 2 or even 3 stars, if the warfare and the politic weren't handled in such a clumsy way *and* the ending hadn't turned out as ridiculous as this:(1) The Ending:(view spoiler)[(i) Day lost his memory, after the war he is viewed by all as a hero, he also gets a fresh start together with his younger brother (not to mention he is also free to date whatever girls he wants in his spare time), whilst June, the heroine, lost every single one of her family (even her dog), gets a broken love relationship and is still pinning after Day (who doesn't even remember she exists) AFTER TEN FUCKING YEARS.Yeah,how darethe heroine finds another love interest, finds happiness and has a fulfilling life without the hero!?(ii) How they managed to win the war, you ask? By the end Day did a broadcast and told the citizens to protect their country *out of the blue*, and those *untrained and unprepared* citizens went into uprising to fight *trained and armed* soldiers and guess what? The citizens won!How fucking realistic.(hide spoiler)](iii) Did Marie Lu write one single word to honor those nameless men and women who died defending their country in the final battle? Did she ever write one word about their loved ones who were left behind? No. Their death is glossed over by a single 'many people will die' remark, just like a forgettable footnote. Everything has to be about Day, he is the hero, no one else can steal his spotlight, other people's brave deeds and sacrifices are NOTHING comparing with Day and his glory.I. Want. To. Throw. Up.(2) The main characters:He is a Legend.Really? Seriously? When Day's own little brother (of all people) is calling him out on being selfish, I don't think Day really is worthy of being looked upon by his countrymen, NOT AT ALL.Day, you can also get down your high horse and stop bitching about how the Republic doesn't care about the lives of the poor people, because obviouslyyou don't care about the lives of the poor people neither(view spoiler)[when you won't even agree to let doctors take samples from your brother so they might develop a cure for the deadly disease *which is killing the poor citizens*!(hide spoiler)]People, honestly you guys really believe a whinny, selfish boy like this is worthy of being a fuckinglegendwhich inspires the entire country? And I truly doubt whether Day would hand his brother over if(view spoiler)[Tess didn't get ill.(hide spoiler)]And please don't tell me how Day is being selfish because he is only human; when so many things are at stake and so many people are looking up to you, that left little rooms for humanly flaws and selfishness to be tolerated.She is a Prodigy.Okay, June actually is a lot more agreeable than before, she uses her brain, she gets things done, she doesn't whine or complain; she is such a darling when we place her right next to Day. What more can I ask for from a YA heroine?I'd admit it, in this book June is an okay-ish character, really. But I am damn sure she is viewed as a prodigy *only because everyone around her are hopeless idiots*.(3) The romance:I don't give a damn that(view spoiler)[Day and June don't get to be together in the end,(hide spoiler)]their relationship is painful to look at anyway. Day is a selfish, self-pitying asshole who should be avoided by every girl out there. I mean, the guy has the nerve to sleep with June then right after that he decides to dump her because he can't deal with the fact she had a part in his family being murdered? What a jerk! Why doesn't he say that to June: "I can't forget you cased my family's death but I still want to fuck you anyway" and see how she would react?(4) The writing:The writing is okay-ish and I can sense efforts on world building and character build-up. However, Ms. Lu never manages to make me care about her characters, what is going on around them and the emotions her characters have gone through always feels really 'Tell, Not Show'. I feel like I'm merely reading footnotes whenever I read to the parts where I'm supposed to be shocked, saddened or outraged. I feel nothing.(5) The believability of the story...or the lack of it:The author still can't give me enough evidence to believe Day is worthy of being fanboying/fangirling over by *the entire country* (he is loved by everyone in such a Gary Stu fashion). As to June, she spends most of the book having meetings with politicians and having her romance with Day being the gossip material of the citizens. *sighs* You know what? Only guys like Day and Anden get to have any real influence and power over the country and the citizens, and a girl like June, who is supposed to be in an important position, only gets to attempt meetings she hates and sits pretty.Also, not to mention Anden is the one who keeps the politicians at check, because you know...you can't really expect a woman to be powerful and scary enough to keep people in line, right?Also, not to mention the only female character who has been in the position of a leader is the villain who is responsible for the death of both June and Day's families. *sighs*By the way, I don't find it to be realistic for almost all of the adults in the book to all be useless/greedy/bad so teenagers must handle the warfare and save the day. It also isn't realistic for people to keep talking about how Day is the true power that keeps the Republic going.Here'sFerdy's reviewfor this book, and her thoughts pretty much mirror my own.
