What an absolute abomination. The only thing that saves this from the doom of getting just one star is... well, at present I am even unable to think of that. Actually, I did laugh when Ada got attacked by a rooster. The books lacks a real story, is over-long, and whoever gave Mr Frazier a thesaurus should seriously reconsider their actions, because the excessive descriptions cause the reader to lose the will to live. Moreover: why, oh why, is it compared to The Odyssey? I fail to see how anyone could categorise this as "literature". (I haven't seen the film; but maybe it could revive some interest. I can't help but feel it would be terribly "Gone With The Wind"-esque, though.FURTHER COMMENT, MADE ON 21ST AUGUST 2008: "I got an A on my exam for this! HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHA!!!!!"
