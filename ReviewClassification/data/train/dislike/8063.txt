What seems to bother me about this series is that as preoccupied with calling every other girl around her a "slut" or "ho" for the smallest things, Zoey sure does seem to be quite a bit of one herself. I mean seriously, she lost her virginity on the floor of the recreation hall in her school for God sake! To a grown man! And she cheated with himtwo other boyfriends! She is in no position to judge anyone.What makes me even more annoyed is that she continues to call people "hos" and "sluts" evenafterthat whole incident. It's ridiculous!Not only did that happen, but she also has:-3 boyfriends, as I said before.-She makes out and practically humps Heath not only in the passenger seat of a car, but in the middle of a public park.Does anybody else find this character just a tad bit, oh I don't know...hypacritical?!
