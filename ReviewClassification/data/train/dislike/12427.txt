Not my favorite book, by far. I found it to be an easy read and rather compelling, but toward the end I just wanted to get to the end to find out how it ended, not because I engrossed in the book or the characters, I just needed to know why the dome was in place.Oh, the characters. This book had every stereotypical small town character you can imagine. I mean every single one from the corrupt politician, his spoiled and violent son, only one really good cop, the lazy doctor (who misdiagnoses EVERYTHING), corrupt drug selling minister, the visiting hippy professor, the Iraq war vet that can save the day (that is until he becomes the scapegoat), and the only one in town with a brain is the one real reporter. All the locals are either apathetic or complete morons (because anyone with any intelligence wouldn't live in a small town unless deep down they're evil).The plot was basically "what happens when a big fish in a small town has the opportunity to take complete power." I thought this would be a great psychological thriller. People trapped under a mysterious dome has so many possibilities. Instead it became mired down in a power grab.A lot disappointed me with this book, but I think the biggest disappointment was the fact that the big bad guy just dies. I really wanted him face justice in the real world. I wanted to see his face as the federal government took him away. I feel robbed that I didn't get that.The ending was another disappointment. It just ended. No big finale. Just make the monster that put the dome in place understand that it is hurting real beings. Then there was a sloppy moral where the characters learned to appreciate life. Ahhh, happy ending. Not satisfying but happy for them.
