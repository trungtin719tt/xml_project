The only thing more preposterous than the premise of this book is how the characters responded to it. What a bunch of pathetic caricatures! A dome mysteriously descends upon a small town in Maine and within hours the sociopath selectman and his amazingly evil son begin wreaking havoc to be joined later by other weak-minded psychos and an army of idiot under-aged thugs who are picked to be interim policemen during the crisis. The other townies seem to see nothing wrong with this and start wearing blue armbands in solidarity to their new officer friendlys. Meanwhile, a small collection of like-minded good guys start to strangely gather one to another and begin bonding around their outlandish good nature and intuitive good sense, an intuition shared only by this select few who gather together occasionally to collect all their facts and come to stunningly accurate conclusions through dialogues that read like the minutes of a high school student government meeting.My good man, Stephen King needs an editor who can snap him into shape. I don't mean to necessarily make a book like this shorter, I mean to make it better. King can handle a large ensemble of characters and a complex plot. He can even write well enough to keep me reading a huge book that I find stupid. I just ask that he be required to not simplify his characters just to drive a ridiculous plot to a rip-roaring ending.
