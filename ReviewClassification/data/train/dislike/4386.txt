Mini review:DNFGR Ultimate Reading Challenge: My, What Big Teeth You Have.As a child I thoroughly enjoyed Ella Enchanted (the movie)! I decided to give the book a go. Unfortunately it didn't work for me.I was actually enjoying it in the beginning. Once the step-sisters were introduced the writing style changed dramatically. I'm not exactly sure why this happened. I found myself losing interest in the book.This was definitely a personal thing. I do still recommend.
