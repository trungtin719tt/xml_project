Not really the novella we wanted but the novella we got.This takes place duringEclipsewhen Victoria and Riley build a newborn Vampire army.We read from the point of view of Bree Tanner, a girl who got transformed into a Vampire against her will and is forced to fight against the Cullens.This definitely isn't a novella that you have to read, to understand the story. You don't miss anything skipping it. It's just a little extra insight on what happened on the other side while Bella and Edward tried to figure out who behind on all those killings was.
