Nicholas Sparks is one of those writers whose works just get worse as you continue to read them. I sincerely wanted to like The Rescue just because it would prove my theory wrong. Sadly, this was not to be so. Same cliched plot line from Message in a Bottle: single mom falls in love with complicated yet steady man with some kind of hidden past, they fall in love, hidden past gets in the way, they break up, some kind of dramatic event occurs, and then happily ever after! Of course, there's always got to be a death too! Sparks seems to have this impression that you need to be abused, stalked, or lose someone close to you to fall in love. Also, I'm not Southern, but I'm sure there are rude Southerners. They can't all be the saints he writes about. I live up North (Michigan to be exact), and I can tell you we're not all rude ignoramuses. There's no dimension to this novel. Someone get this dude a writing class or at least a new idea! He clearly hasn't had one in years.
