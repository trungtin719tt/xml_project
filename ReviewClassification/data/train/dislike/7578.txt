I have this unfortunate penchant for ugly things; I buy ugly jewlery, I go out with slightly unatractive men, and I read books like this.It's awful, and yet there is something about how awful it is that made me enjoy it. I have a relationship with VC Andrews that goes way back. In my junior high days these awful books were all the rage, along with body glitter and peel off nail polish. Reading this book again was like going back to a simpler time; a time when there were no bills, no laundry and when my greatest concern was if Dan would ask to borrow a pencil in math class (I had a ready supply, just in case).It was a very quick read, which is possibly it's only merit. So, if you are looking for something to pass the time, which is slightly trashier than warm wine coolers in a trailer park, read this book.
