I enjoyed Devil in the White City, particularly for the wealth of information (tons of great trivia!) in this novel-style nonfiction book. I probably would have appreciated it more, though, if I were from Chicago, a city planner or architect, or had a fascination with serial killers.What was by far the most irksome for me was Larson's insistence on foreshadowing absolutely every character introduction and happening in the book. Some are clever, but this "one day, he would make headlines"-style became tiresome for me, quickly.Beyond this style irritation, I was disappointed, in Larson's failure to ever unite the two main threads: those of the World's Fair (mostly its chief architect, Daniel Burnham) and "America's first serial killer," H.H. Holmes, who murdered dozens during the same period. They are each interesting, but aside from not seeing concrete ties between the stories, the reader is unsure of why Larson would pick these specific lives to parallel. Why not a madam operating in Chicago at the time? Why not a Zulu warrior brought to America as an exhibition piece? Etc.Regardless of why Larson chose the World's Fair and H.H. Holmes as threads for his narrative, through them, readers can learn a great deal about this period in American history.
