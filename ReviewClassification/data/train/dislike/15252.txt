Apart from the fact that only Jericho Barrons could have rescuedBittenfrom a pool of mindboggling dullness, Armstrong's werewolves just didn't match my expectations *sulkily stripes awayraw animalism, carnality, pack troubles, alpha fights, angst, werewolvish sex- whatever that may be..*. I actually caught myself longing for the werewolves inBlood &amp; Chocolate, trailer trashy and imperfect as they were.Wouldn't surprise me if the pack inBittengrows organic tomatoes for a living too.I'm probably just bitter though, everyone else on Goodreads seems to be bitten and smitten.
