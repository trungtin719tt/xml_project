(My wife loved this book). I found the insights into the Medici family and into the culture of Italy at that time to be very interesting. But I found the details of Michelangolo's life to be a bit overworked. I don't think Mr. Stone really had to give insight for the reader into EVERY significant work of his life. After a while we come to understand the emotional process that he went through with each work without having to experience it over and over.I was also rather disturbed by the author's awkward attempts at masking Michelangelo's obvious homosexuality. Could there be a little homophobia going on here?Anyhoo, I read about 2/3 of it.
