what you're guaranteed with a sarah dessen book: a female protagonist experiencing a Realization About Life; a cute and/or boring romance; a teenage male love interest who isn't really anything to write home about unless you squint and optimist the sh*t out of it; at least one solid friendship; p good dialogue.but what you can also get with sarah dessen: mind-numbing familial drama; constant truisms; liberal amounts of girl hate/slut shaming/not like other girls-ness; flat characters; a deus ex machina-esque epiphany in parents that their mediocre teenage daughter is actually the best ever!!!! (well, i should say "parent." sarah dessen characters rarely have two.)fortunately, and unfortunately, this book checks off all of the above???bottom line: it's always about how they balance y'know???? the answer for this one: not that well!!!
