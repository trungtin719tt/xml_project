The two stars are mainly because of my history with this book, plus the fact that he wrote it for his son.I used to love these books, they were very favorite books when I read them and Riordan was, as far as I was concerned, a genius. Then I read some other things, and I got interested in some other books that became my favorites instead of these, but I still remembered these books as really, really great.Then, a couple of weeks ago, I reread the series. I had been reading about them online and hearing about them, mostly some negative things, and I was wondering if I had been wrong the first time I read them. Well, it turns out I was, at least in my opinion.First, the writing is junk. I am not saying the plot or the characters (yet), I am saying the writing. I recognized what I saw here, and I can recognize this in all of his kids books. This was a guy who didn't know how to write, and knew this about himself, but was clever, and put just enough more-or-less witty remarks and corny jokes in to distract the readers from the fact that he can't write. I recognize his inability to write in his adult books, too. Even though he has written many, many books by this point, both before and after Percy Jackson, he can't exactly write a book.The next thing which irritated me were the jokes on their own. Just bad. It was funny at times, I admit that. And in the first couple of chapters it's fine. But by the time you are third of the way into the first book and have been hearing these not-so-witty, not-so-funny "jokes" then I kind of just wanted to throw the book out of the window. When a series has a couple of remarks like this scattered about, and used at important times, then it's funny, or at least one can stand it. But just the jokes every five seconds were making me claw my own eyes out.Maybe I am being unreasonable about this one, but I found his portrayal of the Greek Gods and Goddesses to the very, very disrespectful. Particularly Dionysus got on my nerves. He was a God that, like all of the others, was worshipped by people for many years as a big part of their lives, and in Percy Jackson he is depicted as a loser he gets drunk on soda! Riordan does similar things with other Gods and Goddesses. I wouldn't mind them being in the series if he was just a bit more respectful.I also was bothered by the main character's dyslexia. Obviously, I was not bothered that the main character has dyslexia, what bothered me was how Riordan made having dyslexia be like. At one point, Percy (main character) sees a sign that says "Private Event" as "Pirate Event" I have researched dyslexia a lot (for personal reasons, long before I read Percy Jackson for the first time) and no one with dyslexia would have seen "Private" as "Pirate". In the fifth book, Percy sees "Gods" as "Dogs" not only is this one highly unlikely (if even possible), it also contrasts what he wrote in the first book. (For example, wouldn't he more likely see "gods" as "os", since he couldn't see the R or the V in "Private"?) . I feel like he could have made the dyslexia more realistic--it is not something to laugh about, it's a real obstacle in the lives of people who have it. This annoyed me the first time I read this book, too, but I got past it.This book series also totally copied Harry Potter, but without a lot of the things that made Harry Potter a work of art. Lots of books now have slightly copied minor things from that series, but never a complete copy, and never as bad as Riordan. For example, the main character has messy black hair and green eyes, and has never had many friends (Harry/Percy) and is raised by at least one abusive member of their family (The Dursleys'/ Percy's stepfather). Next, he finds out he is has magic and gets a special weapon (Harry's wand/Riptide) and he goes to school to learn about his magic (Hogwarts/Camp-half-blood) he meets a very wise teacher who he likes (Dumbledore/Chiron) and one teacher that he doesn't like (Snape/Dionysus. Though Snape was a much better and more complex character then Dionysus was in Percy Jackson). The main character's two best friends are boy who is very loyal, but not that smart (Ron/Grover) and girl who is brilliant but can be a little bit of a know-it-all sometimes (Hermione/Annabeth). There is a boy with longish blonde hair who is cruel to the main character (Malfoy/Luke), and a set of mischievous brothers (Fred and George/Travis and Connor) and set of twins where one dies (Fred and George/Caster and Pollux). The villain's name is not supposed to be said (Voldemort/Kronos), and at some point the main character is known for surviving something no one has before (Harry survived the killing curse/Percy reached sixteen), there is a character who is not in the series very much, but is very kind and nice to the main character, but he dies (Cedric/Beckendorf) and this character was also dating a girl who was nice enough but cried a lot (Cho Chang/Silena Beauregard). I could go on. It appears that Ridordan had a pretty good idea for a book series, but couldn't think of a plot so he found one that had already been used and was popular, but changed it slightly.In short, I can't think of Percy Jackson as anything more then a cheap, Harry Potter rip-off.
