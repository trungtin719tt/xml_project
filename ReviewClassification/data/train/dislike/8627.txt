Okay, if I had a half star I would give this one that extra half. But only because there are pirates.Things that irritated me:"Och lassie, I swear I'll never lie to ye." "Oh, sorry, I didn't tell ye about that extra wife because I was afraid ye'd hate me. But that's all the secrets." "Och, I'm sorry I didn't tell ye about having a son, I was afraid ye'd hate me. But that's all the secrets, I swear."Also, John Grey better show up a lot more in the next book, because I fail to see how he could possibly be a character so beloved he warrants his own series. He's pretty much thrown in there to prove that not all gay men are sadistic incestuous rapists.Oh wait, he's also in there as a way to work in an awkward conversation about how overly long books aren't in need of editors, because it's all about character development, and how characters in books aren't really modeled afterthe author's wishful perception of herself, and her sick fantasies about spanking her ideal love monkeyreal life people.
