Transferring review into the audio edition. Mostly because Simon Vance is the only reason I didn't quit :)This is somewhat frustrating because this book is actually a decent story. The problem is, it's much too long. It either needed to be drastically shortened or it needed more conflict throughout. It was told in a very smooth and steady style that I believe would work very well for someone who wants to relax and get lost in a book for a very long while. This is not me.I wouldn't say that it's a bad book, quality-wise, it just really wasn't for me. And, this one's a bit weird, Barker's female characters make me think 80s TV. I tend to visualize them with shoulder pads. I have no idea why they make me think of that.He had a wonderful character in this book, Pie "oh" Pah, that I really would have loved to know more about. But sometimes his secondary characters are far more interesting than the primaries.
