A Discovery of a Crappy Book. This book is terrible. Why oh why were the stupid witches discovered. Here is the plot:Day One.I went to the library. I am a witch; he is a vampire. I shouldn't love him. But he is so cold and I am so hot for him. I had lunch and did some yoga.Day Two.I went to the library. Some people may or may not have been there, and they may or may not have been magical. I am a witch; he is a vampire. I shouldn't love him. But he is so cold and I am so hot for him. I had lunch and did some yoga.Day Three.I went to the library. Some people may or may not have been there, and they may or may not have been magical. Today's book glowed when I touched it. I am a witch. He is a vampire. I shouldn't love him. But he is so cold and I am so hot for him. I had lunch and did some yoga.This is seriously like the first 200 pages of the book. The rest doesn't get any better.
