Not that the blurb gives away much of this book and not that I was even remotely interested in it, but a review came up on my feed of someone blacklisting this book. Curious, I clicked the links to work out why.Here is one which I feel is most impactful:http://deirdre.net/marion-zimmer-brad...To summarise though, this author supports her husband who was a known pedophile. The above link shows her daughter saying the author herself molested her (the daughter). So, to all my friends who want to read this or any of the author's other books, I would strongly suggest not to support a monster.If anyone has anyone more information on this or if I am wrong on any counts, please let me know. I am just absolutely horrified by what I have read and felt I should share.
