I really wanted lo like this book, my hopes where high, because I LOVE vampire books and this is one of the most important, and it is without a doubt, the most boring one.I hate Anne Rice's writing, it makes me want to cut my veins.Let me give you an example:My keyboard is very beatiful, I like how the "Q" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "Q" I also like how the "E" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "E" I also like how the "W" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "W" I also like how the "R" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "R" I also like how the "T" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "T" I alsolike how the "Y" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "Y" I also like how the "U" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "U" I also like how the "I" feels underneath my finger when I press the button to type the letter "I"Yes, it is THAT repetitive. The characters ramble and ramble and ramble and ramble about things that 1.- Do not make sense with the story 2.- Have been said a thousand times before 3.- Are beautiful, everything in this book is beaitiful, the flowers are beautiful and she describes them for 7 pages, the windows is beautiful, the coin on the floor is beautiful, the moth documentary is beautiful.... it makes me want to kill myself.
