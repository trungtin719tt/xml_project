I really hate this book. I also hate "Petals on The Wind", "If There Be Thorns" and "Seeds of Yesterday". I say this having just re-read each of the above 17 years after I first read them (they were heady stuff to a 12 year old), and I was appalled at the predictability of the plot, the characters, the obsession Virgina Andrews appeared to harbour for incestuous relationships.I hate the fact that characters are so stereotypically physically stunning, but must shoulder a terrible tragic burden. I hate the dialogue used. Awful. Simply awful.
