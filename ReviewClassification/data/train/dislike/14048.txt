I can't continue reading this cringe-worthy book.This book has little things that indicate that J know more about the era (1890s) than does the author. First of all, the title: this is set in the United States, where calling suffragists "suffragettes" was insulting and condescending. (In England, militant suffragists embraced the term "suffragette," but this takes place in the U. S.). The term "tuxedo" is an anachronism and shouldn't appear in anything that takes place before the 1920s; in the 1890s, alternatives are "evening suit," or just "tailcoat" or "top hat and tails" convey what you're going for. I'd have to double check, but a room called a "den" sounds anachronistic, too; drawing rooms were the equivalent.More to the point, I dislike every character in the book. Especially Mr. Daggers, a sexual predator reminiscent of Donald Dump. Ew. Hence cringe-worthy.
