i can't wait for this book i loooooved hush hush, i sooo fell in love with patch, read crescendo but i have to say i was a little disappointed with nora, she gets pushed around way to much and she just takes it, i read crecendo and finished it within 2 days and i love the way B. Fitzpatrick always make you think that you know exactly what gonna happen and then she turns the book upside down, its great!im looking farward to this book but also looking farward to nora growing some balls and sticking up for herself, i mean yeh she acts all hard and mighty strong with patch but when it comes to marcy miller she is a doormat.oct 2011 is a long way to wait....i'm counting the days
