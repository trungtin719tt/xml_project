This is by E. Annie Proulx, so all the characters are named things like "Tobogganlips McCupboardcake" and everyone endures a series of darkly humorous, preciously rendered misfortunes. Though the movie was nothing to write home about either, I actually liked it better than the book, for the enjoyable scenery, half-decent performances, and dearth of skull-shatteringly dippy prose.It's not like it's the worst thing I've ever read, and I never entertained the thought of quitting mid-book with any real seriousness. I did, however, do a lot of groaning and eye-rolling, both favorite pastimes of mine so in the end it wasn't a total loss.
