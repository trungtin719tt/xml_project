Finishing this was a chore. I know I've read other books by Koontz before, but it's been a long time &amp; then in paperbacks. His writing never appealed to me much years ago, but due to several rave reviews I thought I should give his books another try.Much about this one seems interesting. The characters, plot, &amp; world were excellent, but the execution was not at all to my taste. He's repetitious - a cardinal sin - especially in audio format where I can't skim. The descriptions are too long, comparative, &amp; hinder the flow of the story. Interesting devices become clubs. For instance, Odd's aversion to guns.(view spoiler)[His mother could have threatened suicide in that manner once &amp; created the same aversion.(hide spoiler)]Instead I was treated to a couple of chapters of over-the-top lunacy that did nothing to advance the story.I persevered in hopes of a decent ending, but the mystery wasn't much of one &amp; most of it only became clear in a tidy summation that just highlighted how little Odd discovered; so many details that could have added to the action &amp; the story as whole. Instead, it was a wandering mess.I haven't had a great start to my reading this year. This one was self-inflicted with grave misgivings. Well, now I know not to waste any more time on Koontz's books no matter how interesting they seem. His writing is not for me.
