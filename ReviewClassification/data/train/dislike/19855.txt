Unlike many other readers I did not like this book. I felt like the story narrative was a half-baked excuse to string together the "Forty Rules of Love." It would have bern better to just have listed the forty rules of love with the list of source materials given in the back. (Spoiler alert! i mention what happens in the book in the next sentence.) That Ella, the main character in our present time, leaves her husband and children to engage in a romantic relationship with her Sufi teacher dishonors her and I feel, Sufism.It dishonors her, because she spends too much time thinking the answers and the presence she seeks is to be found in another person, rather than deep within herself. It dishonors Sufism by showing a Sufi teacher becoming romantically engaged with a married woman, and taking off with her to another country. Rather than becoming a bridge as a teacher, who does not have sex with his student, to help her realize her own potential, the gifts that are within her, he takes off with her to Turkey. This may seem romantic, but is also emotionally and spiritually cheap.
