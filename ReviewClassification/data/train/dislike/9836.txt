This series is fun, if you don't look too closely. ;) It's brain candy, like a great episode of Buffy or something. But I do have several bones to pick with this one. Like why do each of the books only cover a ~48 hr time period?! It's like reading an episode of 24. It just seems impossible to cover that much ground in such a small time frame, especially since the characters are even sleeping and eating. What?Also, there is the totally annoying revisit of the Erik-Heath-Zoey love triangle, which I was SO over with the first time it was resolved. Seriously. I know they're teenagers, but can we puh-leeze move on? Just have her end up with Stark already and let's get onto other things.I also find some of the language annoying (i.e. Zoey tries not to swear, and so says things like "Bullpoopie" which is a word that should have never been created, ever, ever, ever.) This is especially weird since other characters like Aphrodite in the book totally drop the f-bomb, so it's not the like the authors are trying to appeal only to a younger audience. It's not that I want all swearing all the time, it's just that some of the psuedo-swears just make my stomach turn.I guess my overall criticism of this series is that each book is like a 1 hour installment of a TV show. I'm much happier when 1 book would better translate into an entire season's worth of episodes, kwim? For instance, Charlaine Harris's Sookie Stackhouse book [I:]Dead Until Dark[/I:] = Season 1 of True Blood. That's all. Fewer books, more stuff per book. But that means less money for publishers and authors, I guess. Irritating.
