Reform, relationships, &amp; railwaysRebecca Mead inThe Road to Middlemarchdescribed her longing to grow up and be the kind of person who lovedMiddlemarch, but maybe one finds that one is the kind of person who would prefer to be sipping hot chocolate and flicking through Tintin books(view spoiler)[ and if that is you, well that is a good life too(hide spoiler)], there is one way to find out and that is to read, or in my case re-read, George Eliot's mighty novel.Reading again I find that eitherMiddlemarchhas been comprehensively revised and in places re-written or that it has changed in a quite curious way in my imagination in the twenty or so years since I first read it. Now having closed the covers on the last words again, I think I could start it over and read it again, even more slowly looking for the balances and closed character circles that seem typical and at variance with the narrative as a whole(view spoiler)[ but I will not because the library wants it back(hide spoiler)].Written about the time of the parliamentary reform act of the 186os the novel looks back on the period of the 1832 parliamentary reform Act, while characters can be since as travelling round circles either finishing opposite to where they started, others travel completely around the circle and end back where they started, the world of Middlemarch is itself a closed and viscous circle - inward looking and constrained - it is rocked (softly) by the air of reform - agricultural prices are depressed by the end of the Corn Laws, Catholic emancipation is still ruffling feathers, the prospect of parliamentary reform threatens excitement and change, even while the railway cuts closer and closer through the landscape and we expect that the town and surviving countryside will be changed utterly just as soon as we close the book and let the characters get on with their lives within their paper world. Perhaps as is suggested during the novel what is needed is change to the constitution, continuing as they have done for so long is the worst of all ideas, but this is a novel about people, not the big P politics of the Whigs and Tories.As a story, it is really not much at all, very conventional - three couples (two of which are emotional triads for part of the story) who we see as single persons and then their married lives through various troubles and trials, Eliot steps up the social ladder from her earlier novels she is dealing - true to the title with middle class people in middle England(view spoiler)[ and it is unmistakably an English novel and not a British one(hide spoiler)], there are some voices of poorer people but we are mostly concerned with people who deal with paper money and cheques. Despite all this it is a compelling, compulsive read.I don't remember how precisely the novel struck me the first time I read it, perhaps I was simply awestruck and pigeon holed it as a significant novel while it grew in my imagination. It feels now less like a book that I have read, more like an experience I have lived through.As you might expect in a story focusing on middle class characters money and marriage, money and marriage go together like a horse and carriage. And the apparent or actual absence of money either makes relations impossible or brings them to breaking point, love in this novel does not conquer anything at best it can help people wait.George Elliot as a young woman withdrew from the Church of England and from formal religious practise, writing as she did in the great age of British church building she is always oblique about her own lack of faith, as demonstrated here in the three clergymen that we see fairly closely - they are all three decent men, one a companionable phlegmatic fellow and enthusiastic fisherman, another for years supplemented his meagre income by winning money in card games, while the third is completely lost in musing over world mythology. They are typical of the town of Middlemarch, insular and unconvincing as spiritual leaders(view spoiler)[ the novel as a teacher of post Christian ethics see for instance the influence of Spinoza (chapter 80 in particular)(hide spoiler)].Spiritual heroism in the story is represented above all by Dorothea(view spoiler)[ nomen est omen(hide spoiler)]Brook , for a while by the idealistic Doctor Lydgate, and to an extent by Will Laidslaw(view spoiler)[ Will is partly Jewish and partly Polish by descent rendering him doubly foreign and a literal outsider, which puts me in mind ofShirleyin which story again it is the foreigner from mainland Europe who is shaking up the islanders with their narrow insular ways(hide spoiler)]. The last two are outsiders who come to Middlemarch, they have broader perspectives than the Middlemarchers.Looking at Middlemarch, we might say that if the a relationship is not based on actual compatibility then it must be by default transactional or rely on a dynamic of dominance and submission, the cost of Lydgate's marriage is his soul, it is Dorothea who is to be the St.Teresa (of Avila) of this story, the time and the place limit her scope, her spiritual energy can only flow in certain limited ways - but the last words of the novel are a paean to the Dorotheas of the world making life better for all of us through their lives. If she is the heart of the novel, the rest of it shows why her impact is going to be limited(view spoiler)[ the choice of a Catholic counter-Reformation saint as Eliot's spiritual role model is typical of her pushing towards non-conformity even in the little details(hide spoiler)].I wonder if in the story of Dorothea's marriage to cramped and withered clergyman Casaubon, Eliot is showing us the opposite of what she did inSilas Marner, there the isolated miser is transformed through his love, here, perhaps Casaubon is too soured or dried up, or too isolated from his feelings by his (mis)education and social status, but instead he remains within himself a frightened little child.This grand novel is didactic, Eliot insists on showing sympathy and creating understanding for most of her characters(view spoiler)[ apart from the minor ones(hide spoiler)], the love story between Dorothea and Will is surprisingly formulaic(view spoiler)[ initial dislike, chance meetings, growing appreciation, miscommunications/non-communications(hide spoiler)]- (on the other hand if we follow the money Eliot's sexual politics is at variance with the legal position of Victorian women - there may be romance and passion but that does not mean in the happier relationships that Eliot describes that 'the Angel in the house' can not also be the chancellor of the (household) exchequer and at the same time in an unhappy relationship it is precisely by performing 'the Angel in the House' and refusing to talk pounds, shillings and pence, that the wife becomes the dominant partner in the relationship) but for me it works, a treasurehouse of a book, I can believe in the inner lives of the characters (excepting the minor ones whose roles are too minor to know them), it was worth reading and reading again, I can imagine it would repay further readings too.
