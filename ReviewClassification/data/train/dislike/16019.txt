If Nicholas Sparks could write well, or if "The Bridges of Madison County" had had a horse in it, the result might be something like this book. I liked reading this book despite the fact that it reads like a movie script rather than a true multi-layered story, I mean it read like a pretty good movie script most of the time. But, I am not a fan of adultery, nor of explicit sex in a book. Nor am I fan of big, cheesy, ridiculous ending scenes that are supposed to tie everything up nicely. I can see why people would like this book; it is emotional and dramatic, well-plotted and paced, even well-written for what it is. But what it is is a melodramatic, manipulative, deliberate emotional roller-coaster ride with this cowboy who is really good with horses and everyone loves him - too much - cue soap opera! (Robert Redford in the movie, looking nearly as decrepit as Clint Eastwood in Bridges of Madison County)
