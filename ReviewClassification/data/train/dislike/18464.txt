Ugh. This book to me was pretty much a mixture of all the other YA PNR books out there. It's one of those books where I rolled my eyes a lot and finished it with an unsatisfied sigh. Let's see:1. Vampires, werewolves and faeries - Check2. Mary Sue heroine with unique powers - Check3. Dickhead heroes - Check4. Shitty love triangle - CheckYup. Didn't find much originality, really. And the characters were just hard to like. I'd give this book 2 stars, though, because it was bad, but nottotallya piece of shit.
