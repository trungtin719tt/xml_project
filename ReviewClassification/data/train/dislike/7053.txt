Stop me if you've heard this one before:Girl moves to new city. New, rich, and perfect boy shows up to school and immediately shows marked attention to girl. Boy has all kinds of odd abilities - moves fast, is drop dead gorgeous, never eats - and girl can't figure him out but can't stay away either.Ring any bells?I felt like I had already read the first hundred pages or so in this Twilight wannabe where Ever loses her family in a tragic car accident and moves in with her aunt in California. After the accident, Ever can see aura's and read minds - which causes no end of turmoil in her backstabbing and hormone driven high school. Then she meets the mysterious Damen and finds herself drawn to him even though she doesn't understand him. Blah, blah, blah, then someone tries to kill Ever blah, blah, blah and Damen tries to prove he is worthy of her love.Okay, maybe I'm more than a little harsh in this review, but I felt the story was just so flimsy. The explanations for Damen's behavior were more than a little weak and his whole history more than a little implausible. Alyson Noel gives the reader just enough a glimpse into his back story to think "ok, I can sorta see it.." then changes the subject and never goes back to anything more substantial. And let's not even get me started on the villain in this one shall we? One word: CARDBOARD. And how Ever escapes from her? My eyes are still a-rollin'. The one thing I did like were Ever's geeky friends Haven and Miles. Their lunchtime conversations were much appreciated.
