1.5 starsThe Mysterious Case of the Shrinking RatingOh, kiddies. I don't know where to start in describing my experience of this enormous hunk of enormousness. I came within less than 200 pages of finishing it, but I cannot go on.A brief (and crabby) synopsis of my experience with this book:First 200 pages = This is outrageously excellent! Five stars for sure.Next 200 pages = Getting really sick of Theo and Boris and substance abuse. Four stars, but only if it improves soon.Next 170+ pages = Drudgery. Author has written herself into a corner but trudges doggedly on. Three stars, dropping to two stars, and finally 1.5 stars because I cannot force myself to finish. The days go by, I'm reading 8 or 10 pages a day at most. I hate the characters, hate the book, and come to hate the author because she took 10 years to write a book and wants us to take another 10 years to read it.Pffffffft...
