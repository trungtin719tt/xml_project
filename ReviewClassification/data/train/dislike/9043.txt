I pulled this off my parents shelves, a slightly battered paperback with a pale cover and read it at some point between my teens and early twenties. Looking over other reviews I can't say I recognise what they have to say, so I suspect(view spoiler)[ after deep thought(hide spoiler)]it's not a book that made a big impact on me.The scene in which an other art student is found when she has hung herself in her brown dress sticks in my mind, along with the scene towards the end with the hop picking with the girl looking slyly at Philip to see his reaction to something she said.The clubfoot seems like a clumsy metaphor for Maugham's sexuality, the consequences of which seem to be relationships in which he either cannot love, is abused, or dominates through superior intellect. It's not normal is it to have a Bildungsroman with an ambiguous ending? Can the reader share the character's satisfaction at basing a relationship on supposed superiority rather than equality? It puts me in mind ofThe Way of all Flesh. The boy has escaped his childhood and become a writer, but isn't necessarily a 'good' man.
