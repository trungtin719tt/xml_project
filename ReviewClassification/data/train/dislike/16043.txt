This book was a massive mental battle for me, between the decent parts of the plot (notice I say PLOT, not book) and the horrendousness of the rest of the book. Okay, let me put this bluntly: "Blue Bloods" stunk.First of all, the story was not believable. Not because it included a pack of civilized vampires that were conveniently all wealthy and living in New York City. Because the characters' reactions were so obviously fabricated that I rolled my eyes more than once while reading. Schuyler, for one. Her character is ridiculously predictable. Introducing, the average main character in these crappy chick-lit mysteries: A young girl, who dresses "like a street urchin" but is still stunningly beautiful. Uh huh. Riiiiight. Because you see those all over the place. Her tragic situation: parents dead and gone. That's only been done in EVERY FAIRY TALE EVER WRITTEN SINCE THE GRIMM BROTHERS. I mean, come ON, people!Oh, and then there's the other main annoying factor: the endless descriptions of clothes, hair, furniture, nuts...all bragging (in a not-so-subtle way) about how great rich people have it. I was so bored through the descriptions of lavish hotels, expensive gowns, antique furniture...I thought I was going to drown in the endless drivel!Maybe if you're a really big fan of vampires (and many are) or you like reading about the lives of millionaires, you'll be able to get by reading this without TOTAL disgust. But if you're like me, you'll hate it. Just walk away.
