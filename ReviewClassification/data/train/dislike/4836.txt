a list of things this book was:- disgusting- disturbing- a quick read, surprisingly- really fond of using sexual assault as a metaphor (cool cool cool)- harmfully stereotypical in terms of race (the Africa references/setting)- harmfully stereotypical in terms of gender (so much man-goes-to-work woman-stays-home)- honestly just pretty hateful toward women??- all for using the n word without blinking, apparentlya list of things this book was not:- scary- all that great of a read for mebottom line: i guess i get the stephen king appeal. but, uh. NOT A FAN.-----------PRE-REVIEWokay, stephen king. time to show me what all the fuss is about.(in other words: this is my first stephen king book and i'm ready to scream in fear)
