I love brown's writing style and I will always love it. I can't say I enjoyed this book... It took me a while to finish it...And I have to admit I skimmed through some of the pages around the middle of the book... I'm just not into all this political drama and NASA stuff.. To put it in a nutshell I wasn't really impressed by the storyline but like I said Dan Brown is an expert at what he does. He can even make a tedious story seem interesting..I prefer the Robert Langdon series and I would definitely recommend them to mystery lovers!
