I give up. It's not like I was expecting literary genius here, but between constantly being shocked and appalled by all the "scary mega-freaks" (aka someone with dyed hair or A TATTOO) and things like "There was another girl dressed in all black. Apparently goth freaks didn't care that black was out of fashion this year" (paraphrasing, can't be bothered to find the actual quote but believe me it was just as stupid), I'm beginning to think this is actually a parody of itself and nobody told me.I should have just stopped reading at "I was shocked when my best friend told me she thought she might be pregnant, she was such a smart girl. But of course that's what can happen if you had unprotected sex with several partners!!!!", but sometimes I seem to have a masochistic streak.
