The world and its mother loved this book. I didn't. I couldn't. I don't think there was anything wrong with the book per se, except that it was too long, but somehow, nothing about the book stuck with me. Oh, and by too long I mean it was too long for the story, not as a book in general.Everything was too forced, too predictable; I mean, the blurb screams "I'm different", yet the story remains the same. Then again, this is probably just another case of "it's not you, it's me." I'm sure everyone knows what the story is, so I'm not going to delve into that, what I would like to mention, however, is that Ms. Ahern is quite a talented writer, and she really isn't a bad story teller. It's just that there is no story in this one. I get that I'm with the unpopular opinion here, but as I've previously mentioned, very few romance novels impress me, and this one just didn't cut it. I know I may come across as a heartless bitch when I say that, but it is what it is. Actually, I think one of the reasons I couldn't bring myself to like the book was that I couldn't sympathise with Holly. Pity her, I did, but I couldn't feel what she was feeling. And so another onebitesbit the dust.
