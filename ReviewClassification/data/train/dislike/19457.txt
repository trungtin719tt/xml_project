Human depravity in the extreme - this book in a nutshell.Before you pick up this book, think twice. The author originally said it was autobiographical. It is now classified as fiction. IF it were autobiographical it would be easier to swallow; you'd think that is just plain what happened. The book is incredibly difficult to read. It is surreal in tone, filled with graphic sexuality and violence. What is delivered is man at his worst told in such a way as to make the reader cringe. To what purpose? Published in 1965, was there then a need to exalt in the horrors of the war?The author was also accused of plagiarism. If you want more information, search at Wiki by the title of the book and the author's name.I listened to the audiobook narrated by Fred Berman. The narration was fine. There is an author's afterword read by Michael Aronov.
