Bleak YA novel that reads as a cautionary tale. This was assigned reading for our #1 in herLanguage Artsclass. Students were asked to read this book for a bullying unit though it is more about the injustice of rape (it does not address the particular damage of rape). It is the story of a young girl who is so disconnected from everyone that she is unable to speak after being assaulted until her rapist targets her ex best friend. She tells no one about her own assault and though she is much changed after being raped (and continues to be harassed by her rapist) no one notices or cares enough to take the time to figure out what caused her to quit talking. Not her friends, not her parents, not the high school counselor, principal, or her teachers. It is not an example of how to protect oneself and probably not a book that lends itself to class discussion in middle school. I am trying to imagine 12/13 year old students discussing rape and ambivalent parents &amp; teachers. Not impossible but unlikely.
