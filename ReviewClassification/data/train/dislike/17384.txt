The book started off interesting enough, following a kid, Pug, who gets chosen to be a Magician's apprentice. But it's not a real magic book. Barely any magic gets done. Instead it turns into a Lord of the Rings wanna be book. Elves, dragons, and dwarves are all introduced, and all of those story lines basically go no where. There is an adventure and the party is split up. None of those storylines are interesting though. The only person I cared at all about was Pug, and even that enthusiasm waned as the story grew. There's a large cast of 2 dimensional characters with no charisma. And from this large cast, there are 4 women. 4. And all of them are just placeholders for relationships for our heroes. None of them have true roles or personalities of their own. And there is no relationship building. Why should there be? These are not real women. They are just thrown in so our REAL heroes have someone to marry. Ugh. This book might have been something special in the 80s. But in 2019 women are people and this story has been told a million times. Often in better ways.
