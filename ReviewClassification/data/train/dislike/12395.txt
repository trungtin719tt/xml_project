For a book supposedly about wolves, this book has surprisingly little actual wolf content and, instead, has been dominated by some love-struck teenagers and their boring, angsty romance. 400 pages of teens lamenting their inability to sleep next to each other, is a bit too much for me... And the total lack of any other plot sealed this book's fate!If not for Stiefvater's evocative depictions of the wooded setting this book would have had zero positive features. I am sold on her ability as a tremendously competent writer, just not on this particular story, which I find dull and uninspiring.
