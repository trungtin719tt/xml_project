I like the general story line and the characters, but the redundant writing is getting a little old. Constant vocabulary lessons from Damien, the author describes everyone over and over again, everything from their personalities to their day to day clothing choices. Everytime the Grandmother speaks she calls Zoey the Cherokee word for daughter and every single time the author explains that the word makes her feel safe. There is a whole lot of explaining and back story and description and really not a whole lot of story, plot, character development or emotion. It's a good story idea, but not very well executed. Also, has anyone ever noticed that Zoey falls in love/lust with any cute single guy that walks into her path?These authors definitely need to take that writing instruction that everyone learned in grade school..."Show, don't tell."
