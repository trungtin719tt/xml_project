Warning: this has a spoiler or two...I finally finished this book! It took ages... I closed the hardcover thinking: What's the point? There were so many times I felt like the story kept going (it felt terribly strung out -- could tell the same story in fewer -- much fewer pages) and for what reason? I have been taught that every sentence should lead the reader forward and serve a purpose. I kept pulling myself out of the story and saying: 'Why?'I am not sure why this has received so many rave reviews. The ending is terribly sad. I am not opposed to sad endings... I just didn't get it, I guess. I got distracted quite a bit while reading this book. The boy and the dogs were great characters, though. Almondine! She was my favorite of all...And one reviewer brought up a great point: Why did the uncle do it?
