DNF-ed at page. 337.(Link:https://giphy.com/gifs/the-gazette-ur...)Rating: 1.5 stars.(Link:https://giphy.com/gifs/southparkgifs-...)I admit this, I got fed up by Clare's constant Edgar Allan Poe references and when I skimmed to the ending part and saw(view spoiler)[Annabel Lee from Allan Poe's poem(hide spoiler)]being a mother fucking actual character in this book, I lost it and quit.I am so pissed that I feel the need to write a 'poem' about this whole freaking Poe business:Cassandra Clare--a satire based *very* loosely on Annabel Lee, a poem by Edgar Allan Poe--Author: MizukiSpecial Thank To:AndreIt was many many and many a year agoIn a kingdom of Badly Written YA Novels,That an 'author' there lived whoBy the name of Cassandra ClareAnd this 'author' wrote novelsFilled with melodramas, Mary Sues and someone else's ideasI was a reader and doomed to suffer,In this kingdom of Badly Written YA,For hardly anyone else couldAlways fill her books with sheer meaninglessness,The same like Cassandra Clare was capable of doing.And this was the reason that, long agoIn this kingdom of Badly Written YA,Cassandra Clare decided to fill her novelsWith so many quotes,Beautiful words taken from better authors and poets,Cut out and stuffed into Clare's thick books.Sadly these quotes serve no real purpose at allIn this kingdom of Badly Written YA.I, the poor reader, not happy with Clare's awful use of,Edger Allan Poe's quotes,Is screaming in rage,Yes! Why must The Conqueror Worm have anything,To do with some guy turning into a worm,In Clockwork Princess?And why must Poe and Annabel Lee haveAny relation with demon hunters,In the sunny Los Angeles?Hell, it makes no sense.Just like so many other contradictionsIn Clare's Mortal Instruments Series.In the very end, I hope you guys are as offended by my poor poem-writing-skill as I'm offended by Clare's stupid Poe's quotes.(Link:https://giphy.com/gifs/southparkgifs-...)Honestly, Clare's use of my idol Edgar Allan Poe as references isn't the biggest turn-off in this book yet, the real turn-off is the YA romance angst and how Clare wrote this book while fully expecting readers to care about the every little thing her characters do in their day-to-day lives and expecting readers to give a shit about these details.(Link:https://giphy.com/gifs/edgar-allan-po...)The problem is, characters need to be somewhat interesting for me to care about them, but Clare's characters, as usual, aren't even remotely interesting nor well constructed.(Link:https://giphy.com/gifs/southparkgifs-...)Plus, at least 200 pages of this book could have been trimmed away, so where were Clare's editors when we need them the most?So, what had gone wrong? Here is a check list:**Warning: slight plot spoilers below**(1) The matter of simple mathematicsThe population of L.A. :3,976,322 (2016)Number of Shadowhhunters: inclunding Emma, the Blackthorns, the Ashdowns, Diana and Cristina, etc; around 20-30 Shadow Hunters in total.Number of demons: don't know, but supposedly there must be many demons in a large city like L.A.So there are only 20 or so Shadowhunters to keep the demons in L.A. under control the whole time, it looks like the demons had been having plenty of slow days in L.A. all along.(2) Uninteresting gay romances:I always like gay/yaoi romances here and there, but OMG how can this certain someone think this faerie guy truly loves him because the faerie has been tender to him!?Get real, please.(3) The general stupidity of the Shadowhunters:First, these people allow Jace and Clary to run the New York Institute. *facepalms*Secondly, when the wicked, manipulative faeries release a prisoner back to the L.A. Institute, our MCs do nothing to prevent said prisoner from harming the children. No, they haven't even suspected said prisoner might be brainwashed into harming them. No, they haven't even thought about this.Thirdly, there seems to be no psychologist, no social worker, no orphans adoption system in the Shadowhunters society.I mean, the adult Shadowhunters always died on missions and there had just been a massive war some five or six years ago, but in the Shadowhunters' society, we can still barely find one psychologist to help the survivors, no mention of PTSD treatment, no welfare system to look after the orphans.Last but not least, no one outside of the L.A. Institute has ever realized their supposed chief is mentally ill and it is actually a few teenagers who are actually running things and fighting demons with little to no management from older Shadowhunters.(4) I really don't like how Clare fully expects readers to be invested with her main characters when these characters have nothing to make me root for them:Alright, I know I'msupposedto care about Emma and her investigation to find her parents' killer, I know I'msupposedto care about Julian, his emotional problems and his hotness, I know I'm alsosupposedto find the younger Blackthorn siblings cute and adorable---I'msupposedto care because that is exactly what Clare's tone and her writing has been indicating all along: most of the main characters were given a lengthy backstory, their daily routines (e.g. training, eating breakfast, throwing jokes at each other or simply chatting away, etc) are given the utmost attention and screen time; as though the daily routines and the internal monologues of these characters are so interesting that they all deserve readers' unlimited attention and time.The truth is: they don't deserve that much of spaces and screen time.I would rather see the plot moves forward in a bit of a faster pace instead of dealing with the Blackthorns siblings and their chatters, or the romantic angst between Emma and Julian, just to name a few of these annoyance. *sighs*(5) When reading this book, I was trapped with some of the blandest and most boring main characters in my recent memory:Let's face it,Emma Carstairs and Julian Blackthorns are reallyboringboth as a pair of BFF and potential love interest for each other.One of the main problems is I just totally don't get Emma as a character, she seems to like fighting and training and wanting to avenge her parents.........and that's all I get from her as a character.Not to mention, even when Emma is a supposedly well trained warrior, she still decides to carry a sword around 24/7 which makes no sense to me even when I know this sword is from her dead parents. She also tends to act purely out of impulse, randomly fighting demons andgoing out to investigate demon activities without telling anyone where she is going---Stupid with a capital S damn it, it isjust the same like Jace, all over again.As to Julian, oh boy he is even more boring than Emma, although to be fair the guy has a bit more common sense and sense of responsibility in him than Emma, and as far as character's trait goes, he likes to paint and draw---still it just isn't enough to hook me with this character. I mean, am I really supposed to be invested with a character only because he is hot, he is into art and he has a sensitive soul?To make matter worse, Clare wrote about Julian and his lengthy backstory fully expecting me to care about him as a person and his endless struggle with trying to raise 4 younger siblings since 12 or so years old. Okay, I know child-caring in such a young age is hard, still I feel nothing when I read about the hardship he faces.I sense that with Julian and one of his younger brothers, Clare did try to address serious topics such as Special Education Needs and the problem of Shadowhunters not valuing their children's other talents (e.g. painting) outside of their fighting skills, but it just isn't enough to keep me interested; not even for 5 minutes.As to the other Blackthorn siblings,they are so freaking boring!I understand that they are struggling to deal with the death of their father, the kidnapping of their older brother and the BS dished out to them by other adult Shadowhunters, but I simply can't guilt-trap myself into caring for any of them.There also is Cristina...a Shadowhunter from Mexico! But as far as I can see, she is here only to show 'Look! There is a POC in the story!'(6) the tiresome romantic woes between Emma and Julian take up a lot of spaces in the story:I have a feeling that Emma and Julian might not have turned out being so bland and uninteresting if all the romantic angst had been taken out from the storyline: they could have just been a case of "I like you, you like me, let's start dating!", or even betterthey could have simply stayed friends for crying out loud.That could have been kind of cute.Instead, Clare decided these two need to have romantic angst, jealousy and misunderstanding between them, tons of it.In order to get to the bottom of the unnecessary of the romantic woes between Emma and Julian, we must first get back to Point no. 3 in this review: the general stupidity of the Shadowhunters...especially the adults.I mean all of the romantic angst between these two is established by the fact that they are parabatai---magic bound warrior partners with a bond which is supposedly unbreakable---and for some odd and unknown reason two parabatai aren't supposed to feel romantic love toward each other!You think this taboo can keep Emma and Julian and their raging teenager's lust ridden hormones in check? You better think again!So,the whole point about Emma and Julian's feeling for each other being 'forbidden' is based solely on the foundation of them being parabatai;and if you asked me,this 'forbidden love' feels really forced and underwhelming to me,even worse than the 'forbidden love' between Jace and Clary.Plus it really makes zero sense to me when these adults just let Emma and Julian bind themselves to be parabatai at the tender age of 12, shortly after Emma suffered the trauma of losing both her parents. I mean, who in their right minds would allow two 12 years old kids making permanent life decision like this?!To be honest, my good guess is by the end of the trilogy, Clare would find a loophole (no matter how far-fetched it is) for these two to break off their parabatai bond so they can sex each other up eventually.(7) Nothing happens:Last but not least, I'm getting to the most damaging part of this book's many flaws:nothing happens in the first 300+ pagesWe don't get much hint about the identity of the murderer of Emma's parents, we don't get much hint for the conspiracy surrounding the demon activities, for most of the time we don't even get much action scene. All we get is romantic subplots breeding left and right, and a lot of details about the daily activities of the Blackthorn family and their backstories.300+ pages filled with these kind of nonsense is a bit too much for me. And trust me, ifLady Midnightdoesn't have such kind of poor planning, shabby plots, awful pacing and nonexistent sense of direction, I wouldn't have DNF-ed it.The Final Words:don't buy it, don't borrow it, it just doesn't worth it.Thoughts I have in the reading progress:I am in the middle of this book and I wholeheartedly agree with this reviewer:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Pre-review:Another series within the poorly constructed world of Shadowhunters, a world which obviously is borrowed from Harry Potter?Oh. My. Goodness.You know what I'm trying to say here, right?I admit I'm being very negative here, but Cassandra Clare has so far given me almost nothing to be positive when it comes to her books.And for those angry fans who say stuff like"You shouldn't comment on a book you haven't yet read!", I want to share this comic (by Vicky/KurvosVicky), although his comic focuses on movies but the same can be well reflected on books and manga/comicOriginal post:http://kurvosvicky.deviantart.com/art...My review forCity of Heavenly Fire:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...My review forClockwork Princess:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
