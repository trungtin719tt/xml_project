When I first read the premise for the book, I thought it was slightly intriguing. Nothing I would rush out to get and read right away, but still enough for me to put on my list of to-read. Now that I've read it, I want my brain back. I like the idea that vampires are a known part of the human world. I really do. I liked Sam, about the only character in the entire book I did like, and how Harris explained him. I just think it took to long for her to reveal it all and to get her point across.I love vampire novels and vampire romance novels, they're all I've practically been reading lately, but this one just didn't seem to have the spark needed to keep my interest. Too many typing errors and random words missing and grammatical errors. I'll leave that to blame for the editor, but that wasn't the only problem I had. I just couldn't seem to connect with the main character, Sookie. She may have been a virgin, but she shouldn't have been as naive as Harris wrote her. She's 25 and working in a bar and has the ability to read minds, which she can't always control. That alone should have taught her more about the world of sex then what she seemed to know. She wasn't a sheltered person so I really don't know how she could have been that naive about it all, especially when she knew about how promiscuous her brother was.And as for people saying that's all this book had, it's really not. The few sex scenes that were written read like bad fanfiction. You want sex and vampires? Go read Laurell K. Hamilton's Anita Blake series. Dead Until Dark barely deserves the two stars I gave it, and really that was only for Sam, the only real character in the entire book.
