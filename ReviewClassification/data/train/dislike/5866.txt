I will never understand how this book is so highly rated. Never. I read this after I saw the film because I thought, "hey, I'd love to see that explored more and see what parts they left out because that film was great!"Let me tell you, that wasn't what happened. How they got that film from this book I will never know.All the interesting characters you meet in the film are almost an afterthought in the book, there and gone in a flash.I am so disappointed by this book. It's been almost ten years since I read it and I'm still not over it.
