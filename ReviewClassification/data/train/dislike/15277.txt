Though Robin McKinley is quite adept at lush description, her characters fail to connect with me in any meaningful way. The romance between Beast and Beauty felt predictible and rather boring. At no point during this book, especially the second half, was I unaware of exactly what would happen and how it would happen. Every time a new plot element was introduced - such as, Beauty introduces her horse to Beast! - it was immediately evident how the scene would occur, mainly because you get the clear impression early on that the author isn't interested in doing anything beyond telling a bare bones story.The story itself falls flat when the author doesn't add anything much to pad it out from the original telling. Fairy tales themselves are rather one dimensional, after all, and this story and the characters feel just as one dimensional. Without giving it meaning or deepening the characters, why bother to expand upon what's already there? This is hardly a retelling, it's almost identical to the fairy tale in terms of the basic story and character paths. There's little to no conflict aside from Beauty missing her family. There was an opportunity here to give the story depth, but instead we are given dozens of descriptions of Beauty's dresses and the books she reads (admittedly, these descriptions are lovely and a guilty pleasure to read). Nobody really learns any lessons or changes significantly as a person aside from Beauty realizing she truly is beautiful, which would have been a more powerful scene had it been accompanied by ANY character development. It bothered me that this realization came at the climax of the book, as if this was meant to be the cap of Beauty's supposed development. Realizing she was pretty, or that love made her beautiful. Uh. Cool?I enjoyed it, but I can't call it anything great. McKinley's later efforts are definitely better, though her prose is always nice.
