I've watched episodes ofThe Superfriendsthat were better plotted than this. There arethreeorphan reunited with long lost parents scenes in this book: and they're all for the same orphan. The mad scientists, having tired of the flying wolf children, have now built robot flying wolf children. There's a "it was all a dream" scene in the middle of the book for no reason whatsoever. Bleah.I read this on an airplane with no other options except the in-flight magazines. Which I read all of, twice, in German (which I don't even speak) before bothering to finish this.
