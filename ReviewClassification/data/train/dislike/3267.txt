I am so glad, I got to know how other people feel about Jonathan Livingstone Seagull.All these years I was under the impression that some great philosophy and inner meaning had flown past my head, I was one of the very few who had missed it all.Seems I was right, there is no great philosophy. Phew ! I am not a dumb idiot after all.
