Wow, it seems as if I'm the only person who disliked the book. I was excited to read it, and only finished for my book club (yes, I do take one for the team now and then). For me it had several flaws and was painful to finish.1. The narrative's flow is disappointing, things happen and then you're on to the next event with little transition, which made the piece feel rushed in that sense.2. The detail that drowns you into boredom. She describes some things to the point of ad nauseum, but then does not give enough detail. Having never been to India I would've appreciated more detail about the landscapes and customs (maybe she doesn't know or didn't research this out). Also, there is a superficial description of the characters.3. There were some parts of the book that weren't needed, it was filled with tangents to the narrative that not only made the book longer, but took space away from a better development of the narrative and characters.On the whole a very disappointing book, I would not recommend it to anyone.
