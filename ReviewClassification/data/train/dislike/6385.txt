This was a reading request from a girl in my Class 12 at the American International School, Nicosia. I agreed, knowing that these kids were experimenting with drugs - the intention being that the book would provide enough information to put them off rather than titillate.Personally l didn't like - very harrowing, and ultimately boring in the repetition of details in the girl's decline.
