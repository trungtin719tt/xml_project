(scroll for review)Fernanda's art was better for this one, too.After reading TORMENT, I was seriously considering not giving this a chance. I mean, did Lauren Kate think smearing her crap over pages of a book and slapping on a cover of a jaw-dropping cover of a tall, skin-'n'-bones girl sobbing into her hands in front of beautiful grey scenery was a good idea? Yeah, no. TORMENT was literally tormenting to get through.Thank God I have a two-book rule (if two consequent books in a series suck, I give up), or else I wouldn't have given this a chance. As much as it hurt me mentally, physically, emotionally, circulatorily, cardiovascularly, and gynecologically, I decided to give PASSION a chance, and BOY am I glad I did!PASSION was everything I wanted it to be. I have to say, this review may be partially biased since I viewed this book through glasses tinted as rose as possible, but I'm going to try to be as sincere as I can here.The cover may be sucky(-ier) compared to the other two, but the insides are definitely better. Maybe what drove me nuckin' futs about TORMENT was the fact that it took place over about NINETEEN DAYS, which is an unthinkably short time for a book to take place with as little action as TORMENT had. PASSION spans over thousands of years, reaching back all the way to BCE time (which is like BC/AD, except it's BCE/CE with CE meaning Common Era and B meaning Before. I had to look that up. Is that bad?), which definitely took care of that issue.The villian was nothing short of predictable to me, and I guessed that they were the villian about halfway through their rein.Luce definitely isn't as helpless, soggy and/or plain stupid in this book. She takes time to think things through and doesn't slack when she knows what she wants to accomplish.The cause of this book may be pretty stupid (Luce thinks that Daniel only loves her because of their curse, and wants to prove that he'd love her otherwise. I mean, come on! Mid-pre-midlife crisis FTLoss!), but all the chaos that ensues because of her rash decision are nothing short of interesting.(In other news, I think this is the longest review of a book I've written. Ever.)So, yeah. FALLEN was fantastic, TORMENT was the most aptly named book ever, and PASSION was better than the two combined. (Maybe it was the historical fiction that won me over, and the fact that Kate had to actually get off her butt and research something for once [or, you know, she could've not gotten off her butt and used a computer--but who has time for the semantics?])If TORMENT killed it for you, PASSION will re-ignite the spark inside your heart. I promise. (Well, unless you're reading it while wearing . . . poop-colored glasses [I dunno! What's the opposite of rose? {Maybe it's that pukey color you get when you mix all the colors together!}])
