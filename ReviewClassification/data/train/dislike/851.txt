about 120 pages, the story becomes very boring, since it is mostly the feelings of the protagonists. However, this attempt to identify me emotionally with the characters did not touch, since it is quite bizarre.So I felt more like having a classical drama in a modern world in front of me.Fazit:quite weak translation into German,grammar partly catastrophic, so sentences lose their meaning.
