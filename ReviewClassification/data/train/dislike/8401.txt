Mini ReviewI really hate giving bad reviews but this book truly disgusted me. I am really disappointed in P.C. and Kristin Cast. I mean honestly, do they think that all teenagers act like this because if they do, they need a reality check.Love triangles are overused but I can admit, that some writers can really do it well. This love square thing Zoey had going on was ridiculous. I mean, come on? When I read about the teacher suddenly popping up in the picture, I was so grossed out. I mean, usually, older guys are sexy and they really get me going but this guy just grossed me out. Plus, I had no idea why Zoey would even be looking at another man when she HAD a boyfriend. What happened to being faithful? What happened to loyalty?Don't Read on unless you Have Read the Book or You Will Not Be ContinuingFinally, the one moment that pissed me off like never before: Zoey slept with a teacher who was using her. How freaking stupid could she be? It was so obvious he had ulterior motives, so why oh why would she just sleep with him without considering her boyfriend, her protection, and her pride? For godsakes, she gave up her virginity to some pervert and expected her boyfriend and friends to like her afterwards for keeping secrets. What is wrong with her?God, its characters like her that put me off. It sickens me to think that there people like this out there. Its like no one respects themselves in books anymore. Its disgusting. Zoey needs to get herself some self respect because her behavior is awful. Thank god I don't act like her because if I did, then I'd owe my parents a huge apology, along with the rest of the world.Rating: 1 out of 5 Stars
