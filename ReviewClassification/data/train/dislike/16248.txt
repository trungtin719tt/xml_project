...The end is nearAnd we're all going to die waiting for this book.*shoots self in head*Edit:Hello, I'm alive again. My friend and I were brainstorming ideas for the end of this seiries and we came up with a lot...here's two of them.Optimistic theory:Gaia is defeated, no-one dies, end pairings are Percy/Annabeth, Leo/Hazel, Reyna/Frank (c'mon, it could happen!), Jason/abandons Piper and gets rejected by Reyna and is forever alone, and Piper/goes into Hunters of Artemis. Everyone lives happily ever after (except maybe Jason, but who cares. Another option is just to pair him off with Piper).Pessimistic theory: (which will not actually happen because Frank is not supposed to die unless he's holding the stick):Jason betrays them and Piper charmspeaks him into drowning himself, and then dramatically jumps in after him. Leo accidently burns up Hazel (and therefore The Stick and Frank), goes insane with grief and goes on a burning rampage and kills everyone else, except Percy and Annabeth. Percy extinguishes all the fire with his water, Leo comes to his senses and kills himself. Percy sacrifices himself to deafeat Gaia. After the war is won, Annabeth throws herself off a cliff. Then, somehow, Gaia comes back (again) and destroys all human civilization.Realistic theory:Leo stays behind to close the doors of death/takes Hazels place, Reyna sacrifices herself somehow, we have Jasper, Frazel and Percabeth, Gaia is defeated and nearly everyone lives mostly happily ever after.Who's excited!Edit:Wow, I'm actually kind of ashamed at how anti-Jason this review is. Over the year since Mark of Athena came out, I came to appreciate Jason, and I like him a lot after House of Hades. It's amazing how much my opinion has changed, but I'm so glad it did!
