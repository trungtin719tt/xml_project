This was an assignment for a bookclub so I plunged in even though my last experience with Nicholas Sparks left a bad aftertaste in my mouth. If The Notebook left a bad aftertaste, Dear John had me dry heaving. Books like this make me wish I could just leave something unread, but once I start the first page the wheels have been set in motion and I'm there for the entire ride, no matter how dismal the scenery. I knew I was in trouble from the first sentence of the prologue ("What does it mean to truly love another?") but I had hope it would get better. It didn't. Dear John is told in first person so I felt like I was actually trapped in a room with a bad conversationalist who was insistent on telling me his insipid love story. With no place to escape I kept reading. 276 pages of vapid writing and with an ending that only left me more irritated than the beginning. When the two main characters (John and Savannah) made their declarations of love after knowing each other only three days I almost lost my lunch. I'm Mormon and if you've ever spent time around us you know that it's pretty stereotypical for us to get engaged after knowing each other for a short time, but even I couldn't stomach John and Savannah deciding they loved each other after having dinner three times! Not only was the story horrid, but the writing was subpar as well. It felt laborious and I got the feeling it was something the author pumped out on a deadline, knowing that it would sell well no matter what he put into it. I also absolutely hate it when it's obvious the author has a new favorite word they have found in the thesaurus and it sticks out in a sentence like a sore thumb (portend was the word in this case). Predictable, boring, and a complete waste of time. If you want a good love story to escape in, try Gone With the Wind.
