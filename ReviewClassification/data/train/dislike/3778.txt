Yes, it's taken me 3+ years to readHis Dark Materials. I wanted to take longer pauses between the novels to really enjoy them. I've had my eye on this series for a while. Now I have a lovely bound edition with all three texts. I startedThe Golden Compassin high school but never finished it. In college I revisited Lyra's story and fell back into the rhythm of Pullman's storytelling. Lyra's characterization is vivid--truly a memorable character--and I liked the world building. Though, the pacing ofCompassdid not continue in the latter novels.In summer 2016 I returned to the series withThe Subtle Knife. Of course, this book suffers from middle child syndrome, but it was enjoyable all the same. I loved Will and Lyra as dual leads. Furthermore, the titular object was so much more to my interest than a alethiometer. One of those rare examples where dual lead characters balance one another... at least, for the time being. The story expanded here and grew much darker; favorite characters were revisited and new, compelling plot lines introduced.I listened toThe Amber Spyglassin summer 2017. I was so very excited to finish the series, especially knowing how much longerSpyglassis than the previous installments. But, as many have said on GR,Spyglassis both too long and too short; it reads like a great draft but not as a finished work. New characters are introduced and die frequently; furthermore, I failed to understand the introduction of several new species, no matter how interesting they were. Additionally, the ending was anticlimactic. Far too many elements were distracting during my reading ofSpyglass. But all the same, I appreciate the world building in addition to the exploration of religion and adolescence.
