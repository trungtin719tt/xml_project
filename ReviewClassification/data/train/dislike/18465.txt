This book was...okay. It wasn't bad, it did make me laugh and giggle a bunch which saved this book for me! Although, there was a major downfall for me:The first 100 pages were really good!The next 100 pages were slowing down and getting draggyThe next 219 pages went at a frustrating snails pace until FINALLY the last page had what the whole book was leading up to.I am disappointed by Love, Rosie because it could've been SO MUCH better if it wasn't so slow and draggy. At the end I didn't like Alex as much as I did when it started, by the end he was almost like a stranger. Also the book was quite depressing at times which could've been more meaningful but I found myself not connecting to it since the events that made the novel sad were given to me second hand in letters &amp; DMs.I don't want to say it was a waste of my time because it was enjoyable at points but I just wish it was better since I don't read contemporary novels often so I went out on a whim with this one and was disappointed.The movie on the other hand was how the book should've been written, slowly paced enough so you could fall for the characters but not so slow that you lost interest. This is definitely a case where I like the movie better than the book.Oh well, I am not going to like every book.2.75/5 stars
