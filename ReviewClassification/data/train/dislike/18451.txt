This review is also available on my blog,QwertyThis book is like one massive parody of all-things paranormal. I might like it if I was fourteen. The plot is very similar to Hex Hall, at least up until the point where I decided that this just doesn't worth my time.Annoying, self-conscious, whiny heroine who thinks she's funny.Her life had toilet-bound stamped all over it.Suddenly, Kylie started feeling people turn and look at her. Or were they looking at all of them?Stupid, spineless best friend.The she recalled how Sara had given in to Brad's "needs"-Brad who was the love of Sarah's life-yet, within two weeks of giving in, the love of Sara's life had dumped her. What was so special about that?Since then, Sara had dated four other guys, and she'd slept with two of them.To Sara, fitting in was...everything. If blue eye shadow was rave, you can bet Sara would have blue eye shadow before the week was out.I didn't read far enough to know how the love interest, Derek and Lucas are like.Just found out there'll be five books in this series.May God have mercy for all those trees sacrificed in the making of the remaining books.
