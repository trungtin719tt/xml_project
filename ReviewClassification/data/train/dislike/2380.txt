I'm having a hard time deciding exactly what I think about this book. On one hand I read it in under 12 hours, so it definitely caught my attention, but on the other hand it almost repulsed me, because the "hero" was so unpleasant. It's obviously aimed at teenage girls, but I'm not sure I'd feel comfortable letting a (hypothetical) daughter of mine read it until she was quite a bit older, precisely because the hero throughout the most of the book is threatening and manipulative.The book is well written however, and the characters real enough that you want to reach in and shake them for making such bad decisions. Turns out there's a reason for it all though, and the author manages to tie all threads together very nicely in the end.
