So I never thought I would read this book, let alone finish it but it happened.Interestingly enough... I'll probably continue if I can find the other books at my library sale...No idea how to rate it but it was as I expected. A bit of a guilty read, fast paced, I rolled my eyes a few times and I didn't like the love triangle but again... I finished it and want to continue so I guess it wasn't so bad!
