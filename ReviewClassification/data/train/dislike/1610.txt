I had a hard time choosing between 2 and 3 stars -- really, it should be 2.5. I thought the prose was quite lovely; Kingsolver has a nice voice. I enjoyed reading about a part of the world of which I have no experience. The description of the clash of cultures was well done.However. The author had an agenda and she really didn't mind continually slapping us in the face with it. Now, I don't pretend the US hasn't made mistakes and won't continue on making mistakes. But to equate one group of people with only one characteristic (American = greedy, capitalistic devil) and another group with the entirely opposite characteristic (African = naive, innocent angel) is not just a little prejudicial. Please: people in general have a little more depth than that. In fact, I would assume that the only evil African was Mobutu (who, I interpreted, was probably OK until corrupted by America) and the only really good American was Leah (since she ended up reviling the US).And as for one-dimensional characters... I wish that Kingsolver had had at least one chapter in Nathan Price's voice. We are meant to hate him, and I did: I wanted him to get eaten by a leopard, or have someone hit him over the head with a shovel. Yet we got glimpses into his personality before WWII and got hints that he has scars as well. Why was he the way he was? What went on in his mind? For the person who most affected the major characters' lives, we end up knowing remarkably little about him, other than that he was a "despicable man". I felt that Kingsolver meant him to represent evil (how could he not be, as not only white and Christian, but a man to boot?) and decided that he needed no more explanation than that.Overall, a very enlightening book, but I think a non-fiction and slightly more objective book on the topic would have had a much bigger impact on me than the story Kingsolver tried to craft around the obviously heartbreaking struggle of the Congolese.
