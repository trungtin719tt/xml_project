I was disappointed and miss the old Jamie and Claire! Sorry, Diana, but the characters are tired, there are many new characters I found hard to keep track of, and the few that reappeared seem to come back suddenly then leave just as quickly, all so that loose end could be tied up.I found myself asking: "Who is ___ again? " upon the first chapter and I totally skimmed through any of Lord Grey's appearances. I didn't like his standalone books and felt she was trying to insert him into the "Outlander" series as a major character.The only parts I read word for word were Brianna and Roger and most of the last 1/4 of the book b/c I was told,"Read the last 100 pages."The action picked up quite a bit during the last 1/4 but then stopped suddenly like I hit a wall. There are many loose ends that are tied up but just as many that are left untied. I found contridictions in characters and some of the decisions they made (*SPOILER*--------------------like the reason Claire went back to the US; why would Claire sleep with someone so soon after she thought Jamie was dead) weren't true to their character. Most likely, I will not read the next book and hope to find someone who can just sum it up for me.
