So here's my take on Something Borrowed, and "Chic-lit" in general - it's satisfying in the way watching an episode of The Hills is satisfying. You know EXACTLY what's going to happen from the first lines of the first chapter (which i guess can be nice since it makes you feel smart and gives a general sense of superiority); the characters are predictable, with a "heroine" that's just likable enough to continue reading but who you generally dislike/never fully sympathize with; it's pretty much something to read when you don't want to have to think. At all. The definition of beach reading. I think this book is great to read on vacation, but other than that I thought it was crap. I mean seriously, is there REALLY a debate over whether or not Rachel did the right thing??? The author sets up the story in a way so that it's impossible to sympathize or side with Darcy, who is such an uber-bitch that it nullifies any debate whatsoever over whether or not Rachel and Dex were in the right. One of those, "she's getting what she deserves" situations. Instead of turning this potentially-highly dramatic situation into a truly interesting discussion over morals, values, and a debate over what's right and wrong, the decision is already made for us by bland, predictable, one-sided characters and situations. I guess when it comes down to it I'd rather watch garbage tv than read a garbage book.
