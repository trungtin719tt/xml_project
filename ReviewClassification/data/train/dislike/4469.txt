i'm gonna dangle some bait here:catching fireis the sloppy follow-up tohunger games, which seems to have been written in the frenzied fever of the author's realization that she had a megahit on her hands. the pacing is way off, the plotting is mechanical, the characterization is lazy, and the 'game' section is just lame. and the big reaping twist at the mid-point? it just sits there. it just happens and we're rushed in, totally pushing aside anything genuinely interesting for the sake of plot! plot! plot!it's actually kind of a shame b/c collins is terrific at coming up with story &amp; plot elements, she's just kinda inept at assembling and executing 'em. yeah, i'm in the minority in this opinion... but i'm right.aight.chum in the water for my favorite type of goodreaders.y'know who i'm talking about: those weirdos (if you're over the age of 17, i wonder...who the hell are you? i mean, really?) who love some wildly popular book and get all bent out of shape if someone - anyone! - disagrees with 'em, and shits semi-coherent &amp; badly-worded snark all over the place. they've gotta be the same people who also cram political sites full of this kinda shit:'obama is way worse then bush! wait till he takes away you're right to bare arms!!!'don't ya think?well, (as if you didn't see this coming), on to book 3.
