Everyone in the whole world seems to adore this book and yet I hate it SO MUCH. The writing style is just SO grating; it took me forever to figure out why, but I think in large part it's because it's 100% telling-without-showing. See, the premise is awesome -- a book set in Germany during WWII, narrated by Death, focusing on the life of one civilian German girl. But Death(/the author) just tells you what everyone's feeling or doing, so the characters are like flat automatons. There's no depth or pathos, in what should be a really fascinating story. Further, the narrator doesn't so much foreshadow as tell you everything that's going to happen, eliminating any suspense. Plus the tone is just annoying; kind of condescending and precious.And in lots of places the writing is just *bad* -- tons of passive voice ("two giant words were struggled with, carried on her shoulder, and dropped as a bungling pair at Ilsa Hermann's feet"), and it tries way too hard to be literary and deep and often just ends up being awkward and clunky.It's a shame this falls so flat for me, when there's so much awesome YA Holocaust literature out there --The Devil's Arithmetic,Number the Stars,The Diary of Anne Frankand more. Or if you want a book about bombing in Germany, readSlaughterhouse V.I can't even finish it, and I ALWAYS finish books I'm more than halfway through; maybe I'll come back someday, but all my previous attempts have ended in gnashing of teeth. It leaves such a bad taste in my mouth.
