Divergent - the Walmart of Young AdultEnjoy the selflessness of Katnis? Love the Harry Potter houses? Adore the will-they-won't-they love from Twilight?Well, here's thewatered down combinationof every YA series out there.There's Tris- the mostannoyingmain character I've met in a while.The pendulum swings from - from "oh look at me I am such an innocent little abnegation gal - I don't even look into a mirror cause I'm so selfless" to (and this is within a couple of chapters) "I'm the strongest girl ever, selfish to the max, got a hot boyfriend, suck it"...and back again... Constantly.There's character development and then there'smultiple personalities.There's Four- thesuper-hotlooooooove interest.He fulfills the roll of Slightly Creepy Older Guy Fixating on the Innocent. He's her teacher and she's completely sheltered -cue the romance. Okay, they're only 2 years apart, but that'sstill statutory in my state.Like I get it's supposed to bea steamy PG romance,but this seems borderline abuse:"My first instinct is to push you until you break, just to see how hard I have to press," he says, his fingers squeezing at the word "break."This book focuses far too much on forcing the relationship and shoe-horning Tris intothe self-sacrificing hero rolethat there's little time for anything else...like a plot.So, I could go on...and on...and on with my nitpicking on this series but instead, I will leave you withmy favorite scene of the book.The Shower Sceneaka thelet's get Tris naked ...BECAUSE REASONSThis is the scene where Tris learns that shecan't fit in her clothescause her thigh muscles wereSO BIGafter training in dauntless for a couple of weeks.While this raises a number of concerning questions, namely -HOW did they grow in the 15 minutes it took to take a shower?andif she is such a body-shamed abnegation girl, then why in the world couldn't she justwear her old clothesback to the dorm?But we will disregard the obvious logic and solutions for the sake of the plot.Due to her thunder thighs,Tris was "forced" to walk back in a towel to the dorms. The tension to skyrockets with this completelyunnecessary nude scenewhich consisted of several rape-y vibes and the complete humiliation of Tris - all to let the audience know that theBad Guys are really Mean.(slow clapping in the background)Overall, not particularly excited about reading the next one.Audiobook CommentsHonestly, not that memorable.
