Okay, I'm no longer curious. I'm bored out of my mind. I can't force myself to finish this novella before the movie.New SM promise: Iwill notwatch either Breaking Dawn movie.Um, in the movie theater.Unless someone makes me.And I promise to put up a fight.At least in my head.And by making, I mean asking.So... who's going to ask me?I mean, it's got to be so bad it's good, right?I am so morbidly curious about that one.
