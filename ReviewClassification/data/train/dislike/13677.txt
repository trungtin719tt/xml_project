Gwyneth is a 16 years old school girl. She was raised in a family full of secrets where her cousin Charlotte was the center of attention and care. After all, she was the gene carrier. She can travel back in time and thus she should be prepared. Gwyneth never envied her, though. She always helped Charlotte who was pretty much arrogant. But she was going through a lot, right? She has to learn everything about the past, learn new languages and maintain high grades. Until all her efforts were in vain and Gwyneth was the actual time traveler of the family. However, she knows nothing. She wasn't prepared. Everyone was being discreet -and still is- about the whole thing until their efforts were proven wrong. Then, she meets Gideon. The gene carrier of the de Villiers family. He's interesting and very handsome true. But also arrogant and treat our heroine like she's a useless ordinary girl. And now they have a mission to accomplish together. But who should she trust when even her mother is not telling her everything?Minor spoilers aheadLet's see. First of all, time traveling and telling things about the future here and there should much more complicated. A single act can change the future (at least for the family) but not here. If they informed the count that the Gwyneth is the one who has the gene and not Charlotte and he recorded it in the Annals, that won't mean that they'll teach her instead of the other one? I could go on all day how they could change the future and how to prevent Lucy and Paul from accomplishing their goals. Nope, too many illogical things.And what's up with Gwyneth? She's way too immature for a 16 years old girl! Why couldn't I feel anything for Gedeon? I really hope I'll like him better in the next book. Even though he treated her like trash, she stilladoredadmired him. Well, at least, it was enjoyable. I was going to give it 3 stars but then noticed that the flaws were too many. And they talk about logic for God's sake! Also her mother, she wants to protect her? She has to be more convincing! How can her daughter trust her if she keeps from her all the secrets? Too many messed up things. No, the whole family is messed up, truth be told.(view spoiler)[It was too obvious that she wasn't her daughter. If the whole family have red hair and she doesn't you always know that isn't their real child!!! I also thought that she's Lucy and Paul's daughter when they were that concerned. But I want to know the detailss!!(hide spoiler)]
