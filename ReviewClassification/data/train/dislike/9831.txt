I enjoy the House of Night series but the repetitiveness is starting to get really annoying.Yes we know Jack and Damien are gay. Yes we know Shaunee and Erin are "twins",one black and the other white.Yes we know Aphrodite is a bitch and that Stevie Ray is a country girl.We DON'T need to be reminded of it every other page of every freaking book.Not to mention i fear that Zoey is turning into a giant ho cake with ho icing. And all the men she thinks she wants/loves are little ho sprinkles on top.
