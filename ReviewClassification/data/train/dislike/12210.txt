Folks, I just can't do it. I made myself get to around 65% on audio, and I've had to backtrack to re-listen about five hundred times (slight exaggeration). I'm just wasting valuable reading time at this point.This is the second DNF for me this year, out of over two hundred fifty books, so I don't do this lightly. The genre just isn't for me. I've read and enjoyed Koontz other works up to a point. I find his characters to be a little to nice, a little too real for the horror/mystery genres. I say if you're going to create a character that communes with the dead, or slays monster bad guys, or whatever...he's got to have some big ole balls.Odd Thomas is a flat, boring, borderline simpleton. Simple is the perfect word. And while I know many people thought that this was his most endearing trait, it was most definitely not for me. I like complexity, I like depth. And I just didn't feel it here. Which kind of sucks, because I loved theideaof Odd.Not only did I not like Odd but thedescription!Aaaahhh! This is where I really started to tune out. Seriously, EVERY SINGLE PERSON that I met in this little town was described in detail, including their pasts, their homes, their jobs, how they met their significant other, and finally, FINALLY their significance (or not) to the story. Too. Much. For. Me. I just couldn't bring myself to care any more.No matter how much my husband or any other male acquaintance thinks that because I am an avidly addicted reader that I MUST read this mystery/thriller/horror/political drama.....I say NO! I don't want to!! Not my kind of book. Thanks.EDIT TO ADD: I feel that I should also say that I listened to the audio of this, and I think some of my aversion to the story may have been the narrator. He has a very 'nice' voice, like a Dad from an old black and white sitcom. It added to the boring factor. Koontz has a great imagination, and the story may have been better for me had I read the book instead of listening.
