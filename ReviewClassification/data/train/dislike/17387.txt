I know that this book was written in the 80s and should not be judged by 2014's standards, but despite that there was very little which held my interest in this book. I had high hopes for this series but unfortunately I did not like anything in this book.1.Plot &amp; World BuildingThe story is about Pug, an orphan turned magician/squire. The world follows the rule of dungeons and dragons and does not offer any kind of surprise. The plot is predictable and mundane. Elves, Dwarves etc make an appearance but it lacks the grace of The Lord of the Rings completely. This is more an RPG than a book. It surprised me how quickly Pug became an apprentice and all of a sudden rescues the princess and becomes the hero.2.WritingThe writing is very straight forward and does not offer any sort of elegant prose. Sentences are often awkwardly structured. The information that has to be given to the reader is pushed forward early on. Without the backing of a sound plot or interesting characters the lack of a skilled narration is clearly visible.3.CharactersThe characters are all good natured and it's basically good vs evil. More often that not you begin to wonder whether any interesting character would appear or whether there will be any improvement in the existing ones. Unfortunately you are left wondering. The book is filled with generic characters. A prince, a warrior, a mage and none make an impact on the reader or the book.Only recommended to those who like RPG based books and do not mind generic plots and characters.
