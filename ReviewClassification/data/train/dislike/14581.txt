Just finished "Delirium"..my eyes are so swollen from crying I can barely see the screen..I was so sad and cursing Lauren Oliver for making such a beautiful story and screwing up the ending but seeing "Pandemonium"..It's hope..i'm sure Alex isn't dead ..she's gonna go back and find him in the Crypts just like her mom and she'll go back and save him...I don't know how I'll be able to wait 9 months but I hope it's worth it !
