Whats wrong with this book?1) 2/3 of the book nothing much happens, action is slow and boring.2) the author tried to present Fallon as some sort of super intelligent character, but really to me he appears naive, affable, meek and non-authoritative. Its the most annoying part of the story: the cop thats always satisfied with half-answered questions.3) the elephant tree really didnt have much to do with the plot. The whole mystery element of the book was kinda ruined/missed out on. A more appropriate name for this book would have been "Twinkle" (the nickname for one of the characters)4) At the end of the book there are some ridiculous loose ends that make the ending unsatisfying5) Some events and how they unfold seem quite unrealistic6) The dog diesWhats good about this book?There was a bit of an unexpected plot twist towards the end, so yey...I only kept on reading hoping there will be some sort of mystery that develops around the said elephant tree but at the end it seemed the tree itself didnt have much to do with anything. The main character does not appear to have any drive in his life so I could not relate to his struggles with trying to change his life. Despite the book's unpredicted plot twist at the end, it still remained unsatisfying.
