After reading so many reviews of this book I was excited to start it --- It is very detailed and although I had some chapters I did enjoy reading very much - I thought the story was much longer then it needed to be and was frustrated by the fact that Edgar did not confront his mother when he first suspected his uncle since he and his mother had such a close relationship. It's hard for me to understand how they could be so close then he hides so much from her .. I know Trudy would of believed in him before taking the side of the uncle that was the black sheep of the family anyway ... I thought the book had a lot of filler information in it that really did not need to be there - all the old letters from his grandfather and the information on all the dogs - it could of been 1/3 of that to get the gist of it to know the history . I did enjoy the point of view from ALmondine when she was looking for , " her boy , her essence ,her soul" and it made me teary eyed.I do enjoy a sad ending NOW AND THEN and I always don't have to have things wrapped up nice and neat - BUT COME ON- the ending to this one --- spoiler --- don't read more if you don't want to know ------ the uncle poisions the kid and then leaves him in the barn to die in the fire , he also dies in the fire , and the police friend is blinded and the dogs run away -- that is a feel good read of the summer ! NOT ! leaves you feeling like WOWW did I just wasted how many hours reading this to feel what --- shitty !
