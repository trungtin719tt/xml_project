Read the full review atElgee WritesIf you are looking for something motivational to inspire you back to action when nothing works in your favor, this is the one for you.This book will make you question every one of your beliefs and that may or not sit will with all the readers, but it is worth keeping our minds open, doesn't it? Published in 1970s, the concept is still relevant today as it talks about peer pressure and questioning your faith. While I personally didn't like this one much, it has been called a classic no less. So it should not hurt to give it a try, right?Final thought: A classic that didn't work for me, but it may for you.Recommended to: Self help book noobsBlog|Facebook|Twitter|Amazon|
