Using the goodreads words for 2 stars it was ok. Fell a little flat for me and dragged a little. I know i'm not enjoying a book as much as another when i feel like it's too long. I was even worse with the film, I didn't even finish watching it, which I did manage with Dear Rosie. This book was not a patch on Dear Rosie to me. I still however like Ahern's writing style.Gerry and Holly became childhood sweethearts until he's gone and she's left to pick up the pieces. I enjoy the notes that Gerry left Holly including; beside lamp, an outfit, karaoke at Club Diva, his belongings, a trip to Lansavotia, a job you love, sunflowers, you must go to the ball and don't be afraid to fall in love again.I was disappointed with the outcome with Daniel he seemed too nice to be with that bitch. Holly as a character I feel for her situation i really do but I don't find her very likeable. It didn't help not liking the main character too much.
