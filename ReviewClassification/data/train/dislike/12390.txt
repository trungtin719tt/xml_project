Maggie Stiefvater has a divine way with words. She describes things in vivid detail that had the ability to enchant anyone. She concocts beautiful colloquies that leaves the reader in raptures.I am a reader.So why the hell am I giving the book Linger, which was written by an exceptionally talented Maggie Stiefvater, two stars if I'm all praises at her writing?What the hell went wrong?Well, I honestly don't know either, but despite the writing beinglyricalas most goodread users put it, the book failed to grab me. Maybe owe it to the fact that I was grabbing it, but still. It didn't hook me.It felt like I was just reading just for the sake of having something to read. The feeling sucked.But to prove that I really read the book, here's a short synopsis:Spoiler Alert!Well, Sam is back as human. He could no longer shift back to being a wolf. Then there's this new suicidal wolf who is arockstar. How cool is that? I'm being sarcastic. Grace is sick, but she tries hiding this from Sam. They try having a relationship, but her parents get in between. But then from being sick, Grace is then dying. And apparently, the only thing that could save her is to turn wolf. The End.End of Spoilers.I read this book, because I had a reading challenge, where I should pick something with an artsy cover. Well, this is it. Look at the cover, it's dazzling. But this book sure defines a reading challenge. And I put emphasis on the wordchallenge. It was a challenge, not because the words were complicated and hard to understand, but because I found this boring and tedious that I had to stop for long breaks only to dread the time that I had to read this again.Hell! Asta lavista!I just want to get rid of this book from my memory ASAP, not because I hated it, but because I didn't like it either. I just feel absolutely numb about it.Just like what I feel when I read a dictionary. But at least, I would have given a dictionary 5 stars.
