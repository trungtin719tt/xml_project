I don't even know what to say. This has been the first book that I've thrown across the room and felt extremely happy about it. Needless to say, I absolutely despised it.The beginning was a wonderful solid four stars...and then the ending came. *SPOILERS*Wicked Lovely is the story about a 17 year-old girl who's had the Sight her entire life. Aislinn lives in fear every day of attracting the attention of any faerie, only to have it all come crashing down when the Summer King, Keenan, claims her as the next Summer Queen. Keenan has been searching for "the one" for over nine centuries, only to condemn each wrong girl to the burden of being a Winter Girl, who has to carry the awful winter chill until the next unlucky girl comes along.Reasons why it sucked (and yes, it sucked majorly in my opinion).Seth, Aislinn's mortal friend/boyfriend (it takes the author a ridiculous amount of time to clear up which) is way too perfect. I love the idea that he owns his own place, yet has no job.THE ENDING.It really is a huge letdown to read the whole book realy enjoying it only to reach the end knowing that it's all going to end up awfully.The thing is, I loved Donia and Seth. I loved Keenan and Aislinn.How did it end up?Keenan and Donia, and Seth and Aislinn.WTH?The end.Who wants this book? I would be glad to send it to you, some of the pages bend up of course from its impact on my wall.
