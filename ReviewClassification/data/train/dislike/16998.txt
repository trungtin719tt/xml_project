2.5 STARSThis book made me create new shelves, named'are you fucking kidding me?' and 'disappointments'.After finishingOn Dublin Street, i have to ask you guys a question. What the heck is all the hype about?To all the fans of this book, i'm glad you enjoyed it.Meet Jocelyn...Who is she?A 20 something year old woman who is afraid of people. Of letting them in and getting attached to them. She likes being alone because no one asks her personal questions she doesn't want to answer. She doesn't do relationships, not even one night stands anymore. But when she meets a gorgeous man named Braden, and he proposes an offer of a non emotional sex only relationship, what does she do? Except. Because he's just too sexy to resist.Meet Branden...I'm not talking here abouttheBraden character from the book. I'm just talking about how hotthisguy is. Theactualguy from the pic. What can i say? I choose the best castings*wink*.Braden is a rich and successful business man (sound familiar? Read that shit about a million times already), and -like he said- even though he has a girlfriend he's not blind and can recognize a sexy and beautiful woman. He meets Jocelyn in a cab and even though she's not his 'type', he still wants her. There's just something different about her.This book wasn't the worst book ever. It was readable and...Okeeyy.What i hated the most was Jocelyn.SHE WAS ANNOYING THE FUCK AND SHIT OUT OF ME.Ahh, i can't love him.I don't want love, i don't deserve it.He can't love me and i can't love him.It's just sex.I'm better aloneNo one can know the real meI don't want to remember.Little spoilers alert - nothing important!!!When JocelynFARTEDwhen Braden was tickling her, i was like..I was so damn mortified that i actually hid my face between the book! My jaw near damn hit the floor. Is the author serious? Was thatreallynecessary? What's next? She's gonna pee herself all over when she's having an orgasm?And when Jocelyn started throwing dishes at Braden's head when they were fighting i couldn't help but crack up like crazy. I don't know if the author intended that to be funny, but i found it hilarious.However, there were some things i really liked and that made the book an OK read. Firstly,the writing. I love it! It pulls you into the story, with descriptions well done so you can visualize things pretty easily. I think the book is well written, but the plot has to change and characters have to reborn or something.Secondly, i think the sex was great too! And the ending - it was really sweet.Overall,On Dublin Streetwas a disappointing read that i really hoped i would enjoy but didn't. The main characters felt cliche to me and i hated them most of the time. The plot was also flat and old. But the style of witting and sex made it so it was an OK read.
