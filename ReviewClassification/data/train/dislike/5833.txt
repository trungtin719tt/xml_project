I HATED this book - why I finished all 500+ pages I will never know. I picked it up at the library just browsing for something light - I liked Pelican Brief and thought I would read another John Grisham. I think Mr. Grisham is trying to protray Clanton, Mississippi as the main character and to do this employs a lot of stereotypes about the deep south, including extensive use of the "n" word, as well as describing others in the town as "the whites" "the rednecks" etc. The main character, Jack Brigance is completely unbelievable as an ambitious lawyer - would an ambitious lawyer given the best case of his life really drink three margaritas before the closing arguments and argue most of the case hungover? Story lines were left hanging, weird sexual tension was developed between characters and then abruptly dropped as story lines. Sloppily written, unengaging story, cured me of ever reading Grisham again.
