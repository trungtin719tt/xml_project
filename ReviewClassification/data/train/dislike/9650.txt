I do not understand how people can say this is a book you can't put down. I usually read a good book in one, maybe two sittings. Every time I put this one down it took me a week to pick it back up. I finished it out of pure desire to have finished it.The first 120 pages are disjointed and don't insight any intrigue about what is going to happen or how things will intertwine. Then, it finally gets interesting and that part is over in a few pages. The final reveal is boring and disappointing. No one wants to read a story about what happens in the end. It was a lazy conclusion. The final few paragraphs read like the author knew how badly we would want it to end... Maybe he did too.Overall, the story was okay. I didn't hate it completely but I wouldn't recommend it to someone else.
