Original Rating: 5 starsNew Rating: 2 StarsThis was a Buddy read (re-read for me) withSarah,Karly,Carole,Kristin(when we get to book 3),Kelly(when we get to book 4),Jess, andCatherine.Ok, I don't know what I was thinking when I gave this book 5 stars. This is not a 5 star book. This was my 4th time reading this and I think my last. The main reason is: it's BORING. There was WAY too much Bill. I didn't realize how boring Bill was. I mean, he was always super boring compared to Eric, but he was a total snoozefest this time for me. (He favors Kenny G music for God's sake!) I think he actually said once to Sookie, "I wish to enter you again." What a cornball. Maybe it's supposed to be cute?Too much Bill, not enough ERIC NORTHMAN. The best scenes of the book were at Fangtasia and sadly that was only twice in this one.The series gets MUCH better when it moves away from Bill and toward ERIC.Sookie, outside of her telepathy, is just a boring Southern barmaid who wears banana clips and pines for a husband who will one day join the local Rotary club and grab milk for her on the way home from the office - when the sun's still shining.The murder mystery was quite dull as well. But at least we got to meet Bubba in this one!I still recommend some of the later books (but not too much later because they get craptastic towards the end). This does kind of read like chick lit, though. I hadn't thought to put it in that category before. Previous to this series, Charlaine Harris wrote "cozies," so I think that small town mystery vibe comes through strong in this one. There is a lot more excitement in the next few books (through book 8 or 9, then the series fades quickly). It's really all about Eric Northman for me.
