Back when I read this book, I didn't know what snark was. Now that I do... hehehehehehehe... Now that I do and now that I remember everything that bothered me about this book, I shall write snark. Yes, I shall.Mmmm.... snark....So let me explain what I thought I was reading with this excellent meme.Ah, yes. How Ever utterly reminded me of Bella Swan, I cannot explain in this review. I just cannot. And how Damen reminded me of Edward Cullen, I cannot explain in this review. I JUST CANNOT. The resemblances are ridiculously striking.Noel's heromustbe Stephenie Meyer, right? I think so, too.The writing:Holycrap. How did Noelnotsee how absolutely dreadful her writing was? She must be stupid... or blind. Maybe a mixture of both.- "I bit my lip hard..."- "I pressed my lips together."- "I bit my lip hard..."- "I pressed my lips together."I swear I knew more about Ever's lips than Ever herself.I'm sorry. Such a crappy review that revealed nothing about how the book was. I know, but I honestly cannot.
