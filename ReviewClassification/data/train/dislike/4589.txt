The Kindle edition is currently on offer: 0.99p in the UK and $0.99 in the States.This is another book, I read eons' ago, and is up there with my favourite King' novels (The Shining, The Stand, Firestarter, Misery, Cujo, Pet Sematary, Salems Lot, etc). If Goodreads, existed at that juncture; when I first read it, I would've accoladed it five-stars. I've still got the softback copy of the book, which is in pristine condition, so not sure whether to buy the Kindle one - or not. I'm looking forward to doing a reread, someday."The Girl with all the Gifts" is currently the same price, as this one, as well - in their respective, territories. I bought that one.
