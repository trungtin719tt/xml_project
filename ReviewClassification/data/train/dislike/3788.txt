This is not a series I would have exposed my children to. If you choose to (and I'm sure many will) that is up to you. There is a deal of indoctrination here, or if you consider the Narnia series indoctrination then maybe you won't use that term in this case. It's all I suppose in the eye of the beholder. So up to the parent, or if we're talking adults then, the reader.(view spoiler)[I gave a spoiler warning in case you don't want to read farther. This series is basically a set of books where what passes for the "church" is evil and it works to a point where the children with the help of their own demons finally "kill god".(hide spoiler)]As I said, you decide.
