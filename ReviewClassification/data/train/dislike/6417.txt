I LOATHED this book. I was required to read this piece of crap when I was a sophomore at Carmel High.When you are in high school, you are required to read many books as part of a required reading list. Often times, you groan when you pick up something that looks like it will be a chore to read, but in the end the book will have a semblance of value. Many books will entertain you or at least you can say you learned something new. I didnt enjoy reading the "The Scarlet Letter" or "Billy Bud", but as I grew older I recognized their merit.I having nothing good to say about this mind numbing dribble of teenage angst. I didnt find the main characters very likable or sympathetic and frankly I am astonished as to why this rubbish was considered required reading for high school?Becoming a teenager was not an easy time for most of us, but Im sure there are far better books dealing with and explaining those difficult years than this story of two prep school brats at the cusp of WWII.I dont believe in censorship or book burnings, but if I were ever forced to participate in something so disagreeable; this book would be the first thing I would throw into the flames.
