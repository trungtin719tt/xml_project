This book was very disapointing. I started it because Wicked Lovely was okay, so i decided to get the second book. Usually, i can figure out if i like an author or not based on their second book.And i just found it really...boring. Aislyn, who i'd liked, was barely in it, and it was just leslie and some new characters. It didn't seem like there was a storyline to me. I would be reading it and go, " Hey, these words sound familiar." Turns out, i was continually reading the same page over and over and getting distracted. That should've been when i stopped reading. If a book can't even hold my attention, then i know its boring.It was like Niall and Ithuriel(think that's his name) were just taking turns passing Leslie around. One minute Niall would be with Leslie, then Ithuriel would be with her. The ending seemed too simple, like, how she got rid of the tattoo. I was really expecting more than that. Wicked Lovely had been, good but this whole book was a let down. I'm not even going to pick up the third book!
