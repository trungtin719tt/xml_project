It was clear from the beginning this story was not going to be on the light side, and being a reader who typically tends toward darker material, that did not deter me in any way from launching into this book. Not even sure from whence it came, but it has been languishing in one of our bookcases for years. I almost wish I had left it there, unread. At my age, I am well aware of the inequities of life.The atrocities seen by and committed to the little boy in the book are almost continual, before it was over he was rendered mute. His only means of defense was to do his best not to be noticed. It was rarely successful. As I read page after page of beatings, torture, bestiality, rape, and murder I found myself almost becoming inured to whatever horror was going to come up next.I did find the superstitions of the Slavic peasants to be fascinating, but I would think long and hard before recommending this book.
