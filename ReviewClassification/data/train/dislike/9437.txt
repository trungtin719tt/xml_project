This book was worth reading but many parts bothered me. First Ishmael makes incorrect statements about how nature works, and asserts that humans have violated these rules, which is the source of our discontents. E.g. Ishmael states that other species do not attack competitors. This is false. Species will attack predators whenever there is an adaptive advantage to do so. Ishmael also states that predators never take more than they can eat. This is also false. I read an article about how predators like lions, if locked in a contained area with a bunch of prey, will systematically kill every single one even though they couldn't hope to eat that much. Also, Ishmael says that humans have chosen to exempt themselves from the laws of nature in order to increase their numbers. If any other species COULD do this, then they WOULD. It is simple Darwinism that whatever behavior spreads more genes will become more common. Further, Ishmael's message seems to have "law of the jungle" implications for society. Ishmael expressly condemns giving food when some area has a famine. He says we should give birth control instead. It seems to me we should give BOTH. Ishmael also says that it is inevitable that humans will overpopulate the earth when you increase the food supply. This is also false. It has been demonstrated consistently that when women are educated, the birth rate drops, such that first world countries are often depopulating despite having an extremely good food supply.What this book comes down to is that Daniel Quinn does not understand the way nature works. The simple message that man acts as if the world was made for him is well taken, but for me the good parts were lost in the mire.
