OK, I tried reading it, I just can't buy into the premiseClaire Danvers is a prodigy student. At 16, she is a university freshman and having awful dorm problems. In fact, in the first chapter, she is beaten by a group of mean girls, thrown down the stairs, and warned that she would be killed next time she is seen around the campus. She is unconscious for a while, and when she is found by another student, nobody calls the police. Even the campus doctor who checks Claire's many bruises, split lip and sprained ankle, doesn't ask any questions. Claire's solution to this life-threatening problem is to find another place to live, off campus. She finds an ad in a local paper in which 3 students are looking for a roommate. The 3 are nice people and they agree to take in Claire at least temporarily. In the new house she is told that the town they all live - Morganville - is run by vampires. The next day a cop comes to Claire's new residence, looking for her. Apparently, this cop is send by the mean girls who just the other day abused Claire and she is in a big-big trouble (what?), therefore, Claire's roommates tell her, nobody can know where she is, she can't get outside or go to school, or she will be caught and killed!You know, a reasonable person would ask, why wouldn't Claire go back home if her life is in such an immediate danger (please, don't bother telling me - "But she is such a dedicated student! She wants to prove her independence to her parents!" - I am not buying it)? And why people agree to live in this backward, vampire-run town at all? But nobody in this book does. At this point all I could do was throw by hands up in the air and give up on this drivel.However, I am guessing, if you can tolerate this dumbness, you might end up enjoying the book. Many people I know did. I personally have a very low tolerance for stupid.
