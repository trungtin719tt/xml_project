To be honest I haven't read the whole book, and there is a slim chance that I might try to continue and so I post this review.The problem is that the onslaught of cheap jabs at the "barbarian humans" destroying the earth is becoming extremely irritating. And miraculously Ireland is still nice and green, but give those humans a few hundred years and it will be destroyed. Please. It completely distracts from the story. Why do we have to spoon feed children dogmatic propaganda? Don't get me wrong. I'm all for trying to take care of our surroundings, but our surroundings do not need to be worshiped. And frankly calling me a barbarian and trying to make me feel guilty about killing whales (in eco-destroying lead ships)I haven't killed, is NOT going to make me sympathetic to your causes.
