Buddy-read with these lovely ladies:Sh3lly,Sarah&amp;Carole(With a hopeful guest appearance ofJess- because Jess &amp; I read all the vampy-ness together, apparently :P)Let's see if Harris' written word can live up to (or surpass) this sexy-ass vamp:And beast:The Review:2 StarsWhere do I begin? Oh, I know! BILL! I have never been a fan of Bill. (In "True Blood" he always reminded me a bit more of a boring-ass tax accountant than a vampire, he just not vampiric to me....) So, yes, I knew going into the beginning of this series that this book wouldn't really wow me. I mean look at this fuck:He does NOT set my blood boiling, in any way AT ALL!! On top of that, my two favourite characters from Season one in the show (Lafayette and Pam) are very minor characters in this one AND exceedingly one dimensional. It may be that this series just by and large doesn't work for me..... BUT I am going to venture on and see how Harris creates Eric and Alcide (My show crushes).I don't really have much else to say here.... I mean, this story has all the things I dislike in Paranormal fantasies: TSTL main character,Boringlove interest, one dimensional secondary characters, yawn-worthy writing AND a story-line that is so thinly veiled a toddler could guess it..... window covering for a love story that makes me want to scream.Less Bill MORE Eric, Please!!!
