Readable but bland.Most of my dissatisfaction with this book stems from the fact that what passes for a plot with Wicked Lovely would have been used as a sub-plot in any other. It can be summarised like this:KEENAN: [gives Aislinn a choice between two options]AISLINN: [flees]SETH: [waits for Aislinn]KEENAN: [waits for Aislinn]DONIA: [waits for Aislinn]BEIRA: [issues occasional Ursula-like threats]AISLINN:AISLINN:AISLINN: [makes choice]BOOK: [ends]So the entire book revolves around Aislinn, which could have been interesting if Aislinn's interactions showed the slightest spark. But no. Towards the end, it feels as if other characters start kicking her towards character development because she's not going there by herself.There's also the fact that Seth was a cardboard-prop boyfriend with tattoos. If he were secretly an interesting character made one-dimensional by love for Aislinn, I would be fine with it (well, okay, I wouldn't, but I would be more willing to adjust to that than I am to Seth as he is now). But in every scene, he's doing something to help Aislinn, or that revolves around Aislinn. There's not even a hint that he ever does anything else -- or that this is wrong. Seth would make a wonderful RL boyfriend, but in fiction, he is extremely boring.
