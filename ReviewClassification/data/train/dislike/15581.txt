There's a favorite device used by Pomo f#ckboys--DFW, Nick Holdstock, Chuck here--wherein they take a woman, give her no discernible personality traits other than a tragic shallowness, and then f#ck up her face. To these men, the inner and outer lives of these women--all women--are driven solely by their level of physical attractiveness. They can't for the life of them imagine say, a woman obsessed with particle physics, or philosophy, or even where to get the best coffee beans(The hipster male circa 1999 already had a monopoly on that one, I guess). Instead, these ladies fret over invisibility because they haven't developed a life of the mind, which then allows said f#ckboys to either pity (Wallace) or castigate them, while remaining wholly oblivious to the fact that their own pea-sized imaginations have failed to fill in their characters. Maybe the boobs make up for it? And speaking of 1999, the consumerland drivel, where's-my-jet-pack jokes, and tasteless--albeit about as shocking as the "She's man, baby! A man!" shtick in Beyond the Valley of the Dolls(See? I can do this, too, although I already regret it)--portrayal of sexuality and gender was about as tired as a Friends rerun by then. This is the kind of Gen X nonsense that makes me thrill at the prospect of being eaten alive by a millennial.
