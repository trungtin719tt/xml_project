I had to FORCE myself to finish this book. I can't even tell you how many times I just wanted to stop because it was so ANNOYING. I thought it would NEVER end."DO SOMETHING!!!"...yeah, you'll find yourself yelling this in your head throughout the whole book at Kiera...Kiera, with her back-and-forth cheating w/ such little regard for anyone but herself, drove me crazy. It came to the point that I was actually upset with the author for expecting us to root for her because she's naive and torn between the love of 2 men. In fact, I disliked her so much it ultimately made me dislike both the male characters too for loving her...and, let's face it, both Kellan and Denny SHOULD be desirable in any other story.Thank goodness the last few chapters were able to actually pull it together. If this book were 300 pages shorter, I would have had less time to stew over Kiera and might have been able to enjoy it a bit more.
