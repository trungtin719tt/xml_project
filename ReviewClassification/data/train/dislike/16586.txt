The movie wastoogood.Aka, there was a huuuuuuugegulf between the book and the film.I kept thinking: maybe the beginning was just slow? Maybe the middle needed a bit more time?Despite all my deep breaths and meditation,I could not stand this book.The main character (Andrea) isso wholly irredeemablethat she ruins the book.Sure, she sacrifices her a few years for Miranda(ha! name buddies)Priestly but Andreawhines her way through every little taskand I lost all sympathy within the first chapter.Herderisiontowards anyone who takes their fashion job seriously and herdismissalof everyone who isn't Miranda Priestley really struck a nerve. You can tell a lot about a person by how they treat their peers.The way she berated the other girls and acted so above them (often showing this byeating the calorie-laden soupin front of them) just struck my last nerve.And yes, Miranda issupposedto be the bad character butI liked herso much morethan Andrea.Miranda's only real fault is her high exceptions. Which she clearly spells out for every assistant who applies for her job. Yes, those expectations includeenough work for two people...BUT all the girls who apply continuously assure her that they can take on the workload.The absolute worst part?The rapey love triangle that almost was:There's the saintly boyfriend who put up with Andrea's neglect and obsession with this job. They're practicallyset to get marriedafter she finishes with Miranda Priestly.Yet, Andrea constantly pulls away from him and ignores him for no other reason than 'her career is stressful.' I was so mad thatshe was deliberately screwing upa good thing.Enter the Hot Rich Writer Guy who justmaybe interested in her writing (but more likely just wants toscrew her). It had an overall scummy vibe.Example: Andrea was called in to "babysit" the couple's child at their party. ..which really was HotGuy calling in a favor and forcing her on a date as his "babysitter" for the night.So this Sleezeball traps her into a conversation on her way out - blocking her way out.He's drunk, beligerant and keeps insisting shewants him:He was leaning up against the frame with a smugly satisfied expression. "So little Andi, did I show you a good time tonight? "He slurred just a little bit and it seemed nothing short of adorable at that moment."It was alright, I suppose...""Just alright? Sounds to me like you wish I would've taken you upstairs little Andi. All in good time my friend, all in good time "The way the scene was playing,I was 80% sure we were headed to a rape scene.The whole chapter gave off an ominous vibe and I honestly thought that was going to be her getting at least assaulted by drunk HotGuy. He's inebriated, he manipulated the entire evening to force her hand...despite her telling him repeatedly that she has boyfriend. She repeatedly says that he's used to getting exactly what he wants...was it really that far of a leap?What killed me was despite all that, she finds him charming?Are. You. Kidding. Me.Andrea this is not flirting. Girl.This is a honking huge red flag.Run.Blog|Instagram|Twitter
