I was very disappointed in this book. I didn't care for the main character... Like, literally, I couldn't have cared less what happened to her.Nor did I understand her. How could she remember everything about her mother from the time she was born? Her mother died before she turned 4 and she remembered everything? And she is psychic, I guess? All of these understandings of family secrets and approaching deaths... How? What? I didn't understand her character at all.There were way too many characters in this book, I could not keep everyone straight. It could be because I found this book so tedious that it took me A MONTH to read because I just. did. not. care. about weird dwarf Trudi and her creepy psychic abilities.And the ending? I have no idea what happened in the ending. But, it was dull and incomprehensible, just like the rest of this book. Anyone want to explain the ending? I am obviously not intellectual enough to work it out on my own, but I was very very glad that it was finally over.
