This book was pretty terrible. As a classicist, I am deeply offended by the wooden, stereotypical rendering of Romans, even Romans during Nero's time. As a reader, I am deeply offended by the fact that very little actually happens. Sienkiewicz tells us about plenty of things, but he shows us very little. For instance, in the last third of the book, Petronius, who has been watching his nephew's slow conversion to Christianity with ironic detachment, writes him a letter talking about how much these Christian teachings are affecting him. Why, he can hardly bring himself to beat his slaves anymore! And he even pities them sometimes! A competent author would have conveyed this information by having Petronius and his nephew, or maybe even someone else, it doesn't matter, sitting around talking. A slave walks out with a tray of eels or something and drops it. Petronius helps him clean it. His guest asks him why he didn't have the slave whipped, and the reply is something about how maybe there's something to this Christian idea of "hey, don't be a dick to people." But, unfortunately for us, Sienkiewicz was not a competent author, so we're stuck with this drivel instead.
