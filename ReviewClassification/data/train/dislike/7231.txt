Not a fan, though, I should preface that by saying that I'm not really a fan of Tenessee Williams in general (what kind of name is that anyway? Who names their kid after a state?). I don't share his fascination with abusive relationships, nor do I find the tragic romance in them that he does (call me a prude, but I am offended at the idea that anyone could find redeeming romantic qualities in an abusive relationship, especially a male writer).I find nothing redeeming in the character of Stanley, in any of them really. There is perhaps, an argument to be made for Blanche, since she's obviously the victim of a nervous breakdown, but given the fact that she was driven to that breakdown simple because she didn't have anyone to take care of her and couldn't live on her own, I have a hard time digging deep enough to find the sympathy there. Stanley is an abusive a-hole, Stella is an idiot for staying with him and Blanche is crazy...yet somehow, you're supposed to care about them enough to sit through 2 hours? I guess I must have missed something.
