Oh my great googly-moogly. Either I'm really hormonal, or that book just made me cry a whole lot--the good kind of crying that can only happen when you're invested in the characters and you're feeling what they're feeling.So. Flippin. Good.You need to read this book. Yes, you. If you love romance, and intensity, and emotional, high stakes, this is for you.Oh, and Noah? I love you.
