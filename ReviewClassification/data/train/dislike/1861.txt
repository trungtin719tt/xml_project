It's hard to admit that a movie with Tom Cruise in it couldactuallybe less boring than a book.But there you go.I read this when I was a teen, and I had a much higher tolerance for meandering bullshit plots than I do now, so my review was originally 3 stars. However, on reflection...Yeah. This was pretty much crap.Sorry if this offends any Rice fanatics.Hmmm. No, onreflectionI really don't care who it offends.
