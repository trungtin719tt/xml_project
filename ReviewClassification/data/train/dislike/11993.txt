I have a problem with Allen Ginsberg.It goes beyond how overrated I think he is, how mediocre his poetry seems to me. The titular poem of this volume in particular.It goes beyond his adolescent fixation on the prurient and the vulgar.See, I know for a fact that he was a pedophile.I studied under one of his friends, someone who admitted that Ginsberg was sexually attracted to little boys -- to the extent that Ginsberg's friends all refused to let the poet be alone (or, in some cases, even around) their small boys. He told us some of the things Ginsberg said about small boys. His support for N.A.M.B.L.A. was not grounded in concern over civil rights or freedom of speech; he had a personal stake in it.I had already concluded that I didn't like his poetry when i found this out, but it also makes it impossible for me to look back and analyze his poetry or his impact on American popular culture without seeing the little "tells" and hints at his actual...inclinations.So that's what I remember when I read this or hear people quoting it or read their discussions of it. A pedophile with a fondness for vulgarity, lionized.
