Well....let me first say that this family is probably, cray-cray even more than most. It drained my life force the entire time I was reading it. Not the first book with incest, I ever read, but certainly the most gratuitous and disturbing. It was distasteful to say the least. I felt badly for the black Lab, he got the worst treatment.. I dunno what people found endearing about this book, maybe I just didn't get it, and I'm glad I didn't.Irving you really tried my patience with this one, I shall steer clear of you for a very long time. There's something very wrong up in that melon of yours, and I don't want to find out what it is, thank you very much. I choose to remain clueless......
