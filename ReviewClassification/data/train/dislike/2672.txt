When a spade is called an entrenching tool, and an entrenching tool is the ultimate weaponI read this the first time at school and I'm not sure how much I remember from that reading and how much from seeing film versions. Taking in the civilian side from school days and the homefront gives a different impression than the military focus of the British war poets.Re-Reading I'm struck how the narrator is self-effacing, like in the old days the teacher writing on the board in chalk but half rubbing each word off unconsciously with their sleeve, so too the virtual non-existence of the first person narrator, named only indirectly and in parts during the course of a very brief novel, is perhaps a preparation for the inevitable. However while the narrator only exists in relation to others : soldier, son, wounded man, comrade, and is a ghostly figure haunting his own life with no future ahead of him, since he volunteered before sitting his school exams (as did the whole class at the urging of one of their teacher's), however the material world is palpable throughout, lice, mud, food, even the most basic things without spices are immediate and fully present, cold beans, potato pancakes, foraged cigars.One might say the entire book is structured around education. Formal and informal schooling, formal and informal teachers - the narrator as a school boy earning his book money through coaching other boys - and as a narrator what is he doing but coaching the reader - take cover, keep an eye out for extra food, a wound can send you home, but sometimes too far home, most importantly he teaches us that the student learns the lessons they are taught, not perhaps the formal subject of the lesson, but certainly the informal lesson provided by the teaching style. Violence begets violence. We can see another Catholic war veteran's storyWanderer komst du nach Spa...as a response to this one.If you want to address the fruits of war and adult violence look to the roots - where the learning is done.
