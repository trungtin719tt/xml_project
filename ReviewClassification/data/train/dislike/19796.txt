UTTER NONSENSESheldon tried to create a plot consisting of a string of unrelated scams pulled by his heroine Tracy White, succeeding in all of them, certainly, this is very difficult to believe by a serious reader. The main character and heroine, Tracy White working for a man named Gunther, becomes a modern Robin Hood ripping off cardboard characters of unsavory reputations with no logical reason at all, just for the sake of doing. The so called story goes superbly fast and the scores of situations popping up get solved in a couple of pages one after another with an abuse of twist and turns but there is no plot after all. I have rated it two stars one goes for the poor quality and another goes for the fun the story sometimes carries on, particularly in the beginning. If this is your first time with Sidney Sheldon, try other Sheldon novels, i.e "Master of the Game".
