There's a certain kind of gentleman who comes to my reviews and says:"WRONG!"which is seriously what some dude led with just today, and I play a game with people like this; the game is, go to their profiles and find the five-star review of Ayn Rand. It's always there!* Ayn Rand is the patron saint of mansplainers.Other things mansplainers are super into reading-Tropic of Cancer-Alan Moore* To be honest today's dude didn't have her**, but he did have an "essential reading" shelf withThe Bell Curveon it, which is literally the same thing.** Haha never mind, I just checked again because I didn't believe myself and yep, there's Anthem.Anyway. John Oliver on"How is Ayn Rand still a thing?: "Ayn Rand has always been popular with teenagers. But she's something you're supposed to grow out of, like ska music or handjobs."It's pronounced Ine and this is her least awful book, which is not saying much at all: it is still really terrible, as philosophy and as literature. If you want to read some Rand,start with Anthem,which is awful but short so you'll get the idea. If you still want more, go ahead and read Fountainhead but we can't be friends anymore. No one should read Atlas Shrugged and in factno one ever has.Listen, Ayn Rand's entire philosophy comes down to "I'm an asshole." If you disagree with that assessment, well, you know that old saying - "If you can't spot the sucker at the poker table, it's you"? You appear to be having difficulty spotting the asshole, friend.
