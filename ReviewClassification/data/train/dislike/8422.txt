These novels are no longer 'a little problematic' for me, they are filed under full blown 'what the hell were they thinking'.The issues I had with the slut shaming that was gradually appearing in the last two books have been pushed squarely into the light here.I don't know what I am supposed to think. Am I supposed to agree with Zoey, and believe that any expression of sexual lust makes you a ho? And if that is the case, Zoey herself is the biggest 'ho' in this book.What I want to be told, is how no girl, young or old, should ever have to deal with the label 'ho' or 'hag'. What I want is a open honest discussion of female sexual desire, without said female being made to look like a slut OR having been taken advantage of by an older male. I want realistic female friendships, where forgiveness is a way of life and one doesn't have to be reminded of their past constantly.It was too messy. The possibility that these books held were finally overtaken by a misguided idea of 'cutting edge'. It's clear Cast has some kind of message, somewhere. I am just not sure I actually prescribe to it myself.I'm not sure I'll be reading on in this series. Although maybe I'll try one more to find out if Zoey realises her constant slut shaming does no good for anyone, including herself.Aphrodite, as always, is fabulous. Those stars are for her and her alone.
