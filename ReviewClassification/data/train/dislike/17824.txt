So, in all honesty, i didn't finish this but have grown tired of it sitting on my bedside table so acknowledging defeat and pulling the pin. I can understand why Lovecraft is a pioneer of his genre, he's got quite the imagination and some of the stories are excellent. That said, he's a rubbish writer, he has an irritating habit of finding a new phrase and repeating it ad nauseum, Cyclopean horror anyone? Then there's the pages of detail which removes some of the horror element from the stories, sure describe the horrible monster to me but don't give me precise measurements of claw length and count the tentacles, just give me enough to build a picture and let me fill the grey shadowy bits with my own nightmares. Won't be reading more but happy to play in the worlds he's created.
