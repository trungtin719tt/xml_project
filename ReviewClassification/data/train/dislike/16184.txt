On a scale of1todoneI'm:Me trying to get a grasp on this book:Me every time Rachel opened her mouth:. . . so yeah, I could go on but I think you get the point. There was so much potential ithurt. But by the end I was doing some heavy skimming and only went on because I was close to finishing anyways. I justreallycouldn't get into this one :(This book just wasn't for me, sadly.
