Oh my god. this book was the worst book i have ever read besides thirsty by mt anderson which i also reviewed. zara keeps saying throughout the book she isn't needy and that she is independent yet every other sentence she says to nick, the love interest, is needy. "do you like me? like.. like like me?" him: "yes, zara." her: "no, like like like me.. you know.. LIKE me" (not exact quotes) then she is in the lunchroom and sees a stalker outside of the window. her two friends invite her over to their house and say that they've researched online about the guy they saw outside and they came up with the fact that he's a pixie. WHAT!?!?! how do you deduce that a creepy guy who is mostly just a shadow in the distance a PIXIE!?!?! there is not enough info on him to even research!? omg. and then when they tell the news to zara she is not even surprised. "oh ok" seems to be her reaction. not only is everything so obvious through the whole book but then nick who is a werewolf and the #1 enemy to the pixies doesnt even know about pixies??? the way that he was built up (hardly!!!) in the book was not believable. not to mention he comes into zara's house and she doesnt even realize he is a werewolf. lmfao!!! how silly can you be to not know what a werewolf is when you see one?? she kept saying here doggy. ummm....no. so after you suffer through all these pages there is an anticlimactic ending where they basically put railroad tracks around the pixie house that they can't even see...lmfao!! they must be good guessers right? oh not to mention cant the pixies with royal blood fly over the railroad tracks???? so basically there is no solution!! the ending isnt even logical.i have never in my life been more frustrated with a book.... i could cry and scream !!!!!
