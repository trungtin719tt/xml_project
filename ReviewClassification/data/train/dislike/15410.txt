Over-long, disjointed, repetitive in the extreme. The main character, 'God', is poorly sketched out by the anonymous author, and his supposed motivations are often contrary to his actions (showing his 'love' by acts of genocide). By the time the narrative shifts to the Roman occupation of Judea the author has given up all attempts at generating new material and repeats the same narrative 4 times in a row. Lazy.The final section, 'Revelation', reads like the ramblings of someone who has been eating too much of the moss that grows on his cell wall.Avoid.
