I usually really enjoy a dystopian post-apoclyptic novel more than most, but this one left me cold on several fronts.The basic gist of the story is an asteroid hits the moon and causes immense changes to the teenage heroine's lifestyle.Issue 1: not enough mayhem ensues with the events in the story. I would easily expect more looting and depravity in this type of scenario. Everything seemed too put together. For example, the coastal regions are decimated ... yet internet access is still available when power is working. Hmmmm...Issue 2: too much teenager whining angst. Yes, this was a young adult book, but others I have read within the same genre were more sophisticated at telling the story from the perspective of the teenager without sounding like a contrived plot device.Issue 3: there was a lot of anti-Christianity thoughts in this book. Characters that had any faith in their life were portrayed as weak and ignorant. It got old to me very quickly.I still will likely read more in the series to see if anything changes.
