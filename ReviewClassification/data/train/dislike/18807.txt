And this is it for me and the Outlander series.There is a section in the Outlandish Companion where Diana talks about authors who do so much research and then make their readers "pay" for it. Meaning, if the author read about it, she's going to put it in the book, regardless of how much it contributes to the actual story.I think that Diana is now doing the same. I've been a loyal fan of hers since I first read Outlander, but I'm done. I can't deal with an endless series where just because she's now researching the whole damn War of Independence we need to find out about what a soldier's buttons say or whatever the next cute bit of minutiae she stumbled upon.I don't feel like "paying" for it anymore. I didn't even buy this book because I was so wary of how it would turn out, and it was pretty much as I'd dreaded. Chapter upon chapter filled with hundreds of characters I don't even care about. I don't think I'll even request the future books from the library. Yes, books, because honestly, this whole scam of "oh, just one more book" has worn me out. First it was a trilogy; then it was six books, three for the Uprising and three for the New World; oh wait, it was eight books - oh, Diana just keeps finding more stuff to string us along.I've already abandoned one series where I got tired of the author writing for herself - the Anita Blake series - and now I'm sad that I'm done with the Outlander series.If I'm still alive when the last book in the series comes out, I'll go to Borders and see how it ended, but I won't pay with my money or my time any more.
