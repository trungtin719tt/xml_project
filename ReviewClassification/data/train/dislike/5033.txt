This was something that I read as an A-level set text in English Literature at the age of seventeen or so. It's only many years later that it is slowly dawning on me just how shocking a play it is. Not simply because of the ultra violence on and off stage (and for well over a hundred years theatre goers saw a version with a happy ending in which Cordelia wasn't hanged by the neck until dead) but the device of concurrent monologues with actors on stage not engaged in dialogue and the pre-Christian setting in the context of James I as supreme governor of a still virtually brand new Church of England.Recently in hospital King Lear was much on my mind, not on account of daughters depriving me of my knights but Lear's conviction towards the end, actually probably that of the doctor that if only he could sleep his mind would be restored and all would be well haunted me too and in fact I found after the two nights in which I managed a good six hours I did find my left arm mysteriously much improved - not that going on from this I would universally endorse old bill shakespeare's medical advice, but this time it worked well for me!
