I had to force myself to finish this book. A lot of the writing was clever, and I did like how the plot was built around bizarre factoids, but I couldn't have cared less about the characters and found the tone irritating and smug. I kept wondering what drugs Robbins was on while he wrote it. Pot, cocaine, and mushrooms could all apply. There's also a cocky revelation at the end that Love is related to Mystery, a truth I did not need to read this book to understand.
