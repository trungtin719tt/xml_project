The easiest rating I've ever given a book. Let us please bury the fact I gaveMarkedfour stars upon first reading; I was only 14 or 15 at the time and inthatstage of adolescence-- the fangirling, over-excitable stage which no person wants to look back on. Gah. So embarrassing.But then, a few days ago, I stumbled uponMarkedagain in the library. I was curious as to what I'd think of the book now I'd grown up a bit (in both senses of the word). And my brother was still trying to hunt down a big fat textbook for his International Relations classes, so I had plenty of time for a flick-through.I grabbed the book and curled up on the library's second-floor window ledge, which overlooks Chamberlain Square. I was even kind of excited, because I had fond memories of staying up all night to devour the pages of this series.But it only took me a few page-skims to come to the (pretty obvious) realisation. The slut-shaming; the name-dropping; the stereotypes; the pre-teen writing; the glorification of the protagonist and demonisation of her rival....what other conclusion could I come to?Only one.This book....is a GREAT BIG STEAMING PILE OF TURD.That is all.
