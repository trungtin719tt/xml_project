I learned that if you have red hair you can write a crappy book and people will love it. I could have written this book in college.The jokes were forced, the premise was too ridiculous to take seriously, and the payoff was weak, weak, weak. It was little more than a sophmoric creative writing assignment taken, like, way too far.Plus if you can't write female characters to be anything more then complex sexual fantasies you should just not even try. I got the sense that the lengthy passages discussing the main characters "flower" were written johnson-in-hand. In fact 'mastubatory' would be a good word to describe this crap both literary and otherwise.
