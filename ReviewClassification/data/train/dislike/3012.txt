I think this is a book you have to have read first when you were very young in order to LOVE it. At least for me, when I first read it as an adult, I just didn't get why it is such a classic and why so many people count it as their all-time favorite first book from their childhood. I can see that this is a nice book for reading at bedtime. But the list of things on the "goodnight" list just seems really random to me. I wonder if some kids love it because they can soon "read" it themselves, long before they can read any other book? Anyhow, I wish I could love this one as much as many other people do, but I just don't. My all-time favorite first book from my childhood isScuffy the Tugboat. That's the book I first read all the way through independently when I was learning to read. That's the book that brings back fond memories from my childhood. Sorry, Goodnight Moon.
