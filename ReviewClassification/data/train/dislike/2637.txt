Ever since I was a young girl, I've beenobsessedwith the musical performance ofPeter Panstarring Cathy Rigby (which you can viewhereon YouTube.) I don't think I've ever seen Disney's adaption because my mother &amp; friends could not convince me that any other version in existence was worth watching.As I've grown up (boooooo) I've really enjoyed the movieHook,&amp; didn't mind the concept behind the mini-seriesNeverland.However, nothing has ever stuck with me the way the musical did, and so I figured it was about time I read the book.While I read this, I had the distinct feeling that I just wasn't as into it as I expected myself to be. When I expressed this unfortunate feeling to my cousin, she had this to say:"You've been drowned with the same content over and over until the original feels like a bad clone of itself."Honestly, I think she hit the nail on the head.It's the same exact feeling I had while readingAlice's Adventures in Wonderland &amp; Through the Looking-Glass&amp;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. So many iterations of these stories have over saturated the media, and now I'm left feelingvery underwhelmedin the present day where I may have felt how special &amp; magical &amp; wonderful this was had been alive during the time it which it was published.So really, I don't know if it's this book's fault that I didn't love it. I didn't hate it, but I don't see myself ever choosing to read it again.The whole time I was transposing scenes from the play over my imagination instead of focusing on the book itself.Also, I want to mention how much I don't care for the end of this novel? It's such an antagonistic conclusion about adulthood (I guess the whole story is too but whatever.) &amp; I'm just saying if my child pulled that whole"Yea mother, you can't go to Neverland! You can't fly anymore, you're an icky grown up!"shit, she better damn well expect them bars on the windows.I appreciate this work for all the originality &amp; subsequent works it has influenced into creation,but I can't say you're missing out on much if you've never read the book.*shrugs*
