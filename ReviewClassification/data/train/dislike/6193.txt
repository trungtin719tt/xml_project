This was onefrustratingbook.Shall we start with the good?1. I was invested enough in the trilogy to get to the finish line and see how it all ended. And I liked the ending with the(view spoiler)[multiple HEAs(hide spoiler)]2. The bonus at the end from Christian's POV was entertaining. I would say skip the book and just go for the bonus.3. The emails are still fun.Now the not so good:1. I feel like I don't have a right to complain about too much sex in a book labeled erotica, but geez, enough already! To be fair, it wasn't the sex I had an issue with, but the events leading up to it. Ana has a thought that Christian disagrees with, he gets mad at her, she gets mad at him, he gives her sexy eyes, she melts into a puddle and they get it on. I wanted to throw the book away every single time she gave in to him. Which was every other page for most of this story.2. I never need to hear from Ana's subconscious or inner goddess ever again.3. The little story this contained could've been told inwayless than 500 pages.4. I'm not a Christian Grey fan. All you Fifty fans can have him. Too much of a control freak for me.
