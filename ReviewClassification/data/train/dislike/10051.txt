I made the mistake of seeing the movie before reading the book, thinking that the book is always better than the movie. And the movie changed so much of the book that it made it difficult to settle into the book as an independent, standalone work. I have mixed feelings about both the book and the movie (which is irrelevant, except that it influenced my experience of the book). I'm impressed that Cecilia Ahern was able to imagine the scenario, flush it out, and write an okay novel about it at only 21 years old. And as a nice, sweet novel, it worked...I guess. But I've been widowed for 2 1/2 years right now--I was 27 and my husband 28 when he died--and from a grief standpoint and as representation of a believabe human experience, I only give it a C. Some of the issues raised are spot-on, but the level of "healing" and "closure" (both gag-worthy terms to a young widow) that Holly achieves in only a year are ridiculously unrealistic. I've met many young widows and widowers over the past 2 1/2 years, and all of them would agree that the plot of the novel is unrealistic. But hey--people read to escape, to vicariously experience a fantasy world. The sad part is that our culture is horrible at understanding grief, and stories like this--although sweet and pretty--only serve to reinforce false assumptions about what grief and widowhood are like for those who've never experienced it themselves. If only life, widowhood, and grief were as neat and tidy as Cecilia Ahern imagined....
