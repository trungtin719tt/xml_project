I once broke up with someone because she was an ardent follower of Ayn Rand. it just started bothering me more and more, and I started seeing the taint of Objectivism in so many of her comments. mind you, this was in college when i was much more obnoxiously political.after we broke up, she turned around and started dating my roommate... sweet revenge, and a fitting response from an Objectivist.
