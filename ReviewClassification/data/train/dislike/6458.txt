#reread A beautiful novel. I read this aloud to my still-in-utero baby and loved it. (But 100-year-old-trapped-in-a-17-year-old-body Jesse was very creepy for asking 10-year-old Winnie what he asked. Immortal human beings mature and change even if their ages and appearances do not. I'd like to see this reflected more in fiction, though some results would be scaaaandalous.)
