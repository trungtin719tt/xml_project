One of the worst books I've read this year.The main character was immature, insensitive, and shallow. She compared learning that she was in some way supernatural, with her possibly having a brain tumor. All she could talk about was how terrible it would be to have to buy some wigs and that she hoped she had cancer over being "not human". Are you kidding me?The "romance" was a joke and poorly written. I honestly hated it. Most of the book she thinks of her ex who was a real sleazeball. Then she meets someone that kind of looks like him and decides she likes him? Then later a new guy as well?The setting was a let down. It could have been a lot of fun to read about a summer camp of witches, vampires, werewolves, fairies, etc. Like Percy Jackson or something! This was nothing, like Percy Jackson. The camp was just a way to get these kids away from their parents, but what did they do?! I still don't even know. They went to a couple of camp fires... they drew each other's names (of course our main character always got the really hot boys) and they went and talked for an hour in the woods. There were parent days where the parent sat and talked to the kid for an hour and left. That's honestly it.Another thing that could have been kinda cool was Kylie seeing ghosts. But instead she was just in denial for 90% of the book. Also I read all 400 pages and never learned what she is? Ugh.I didn't appreciate the author calling something "retarded" nor did I like that she referred to something as "too gay". It shouldn't surprise you by this point in the review that I thought this entire book was poorly written. It barely had a plot and what it did have the poorly written characters ruined it. The author constantly threw in things that did nothing to further the plot at all. At all.This was no fun to read and I'm honestly shocked that I finished it. I do not recommend it, there are much better paranormal books out there if you're in the mood for one.
