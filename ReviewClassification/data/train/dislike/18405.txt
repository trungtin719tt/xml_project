Warning: Discussion of the ending of the novel surely constitutes a spoiler."Whoareyou, Miss Snowe?""Who am I indeed? Perhaps a personage in disguise."I applaud CB for holding out against her father, who wanted the conventional "happy" end for the novel, i.e. marriage, for what could possibly be happier, more fulfilling, more necessary to woman and man than to sail from stormy seas into that particular harbour? CB left the ending ambiguous, made the stormy sea such that the survival of the prospective bridegroom is left in doubt. She herself speaks of the whole undertaking in a somewhat sardonic tone in a letter to her publisher, George Smith - quote therefrom by way of the notes:With regard to the momentous point - M. Paul's fate - in case any one in future should request to be enlightened thereon - they may be told that it was designed that every reader should settle the catastrophe for himself, according to the the quality of his disposition, the tender or remorseful impulse of his nature. Drowning and Matrimony are the fearful alternatives. The Merciful (...) will of course choose the former and milder doom - drown him to put him out of pain. The cruel-hearted will on the contrary pitilessly impale him on the second horn of the dilemma - marrying him without ruth or compunction to that - person - that - that - individual - 'Lucy Snowe'.Interesting viewpoint, as CB herself was about to be married to the Reverend A.B. Nicholls.If I'm entirely honest, after 547 pages I was so heartily sick of that individual Lucy Snowe, and so little enamoured of her paramour, M. Paul that whether their fates were permanently entwined or not was of very little concern to me. On balance, I think I prefer to see Lucy as a single lady, making her own way in the world. As long as she doesn't cast herself as a tragic heroine. But I think she's too sensible for that.Il y a des longueurs.
