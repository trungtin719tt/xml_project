I hated this book, but I can't separate my frustration over Ever's stupid decision making from my annoyance with the book, so I don't know if I hated it because of what happened in it or because it just sucks. I kind of think I hated it because of the book's outcome, which then leads me to admit that maybe I sort of liked it and let it get to me so much that the end angered me and led me to believe that I hated it. Are you confused yet? I am. So, in a nutshell, the whole book is about the fact that despite falling in love with each other over and over for hundreds of years, Ever and Damen have never had a chance to erm, consummate their love because Ever has always been murdered before that could happen. Finally, it seems no obstacles stand in their way. ALAS, 'tis not to be. Damen is stricken with some sort of sickness and Ever must work out what has happened in time to save him. She does save him despite her extreme stupidity. She trusts the villain of the book instead of two girls who befriended her sister before she "crossed over" and therein lies my extreme frustration. Who would do that?? Hmm, let me think: trust two girls my sweet, dead 12 year old sister trusted or trust the evil immortal who has poisoned the man I am destined to be with forever? That does not seem like a hard decision to me. After Ever distrusted Roman (the evil immortal) from first laying eyes on him, WHY would she suddenly put her and Damen lives in his hands? I maintain, she wouldn't, and that fact that she did MADE ME SO AGGRAVATED. For being so stupid, she deserves never to be able to touch him again.Click here for my review on the next book in the series:Shadowland
