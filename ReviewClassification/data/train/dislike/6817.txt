As most of you know, I LOVE Nicholas Sparks. I did find this book very predictable more so than most of his other books. I can see where it would appeal to the "younger" crowd. The main character is 17 yrs old and with Miley Cyrus having a say in the character's name and a dedication in front of the book, it is sure to be a seller among young teen readers! However, I am not sure how I feel about this book. The story is sad, frustrating and unrealistic at times. I don't like the way the mother handled the "divorce" situation, I think that the 17 year old was a disrespectful to her family and with no real consequences. It seems that the younger brother is made out to be a bit whiny (but he is only 10 yrs old). I like how the relationship between the father/daughter ended up but I feel sad that so many years were lost because of a misunderstanding that the mother was aware of. Without giving too much away, I would have to say yes, I liked it but not my favorite. The movie should be out soon so we will see how it all plays out. I gave it 2 stars, possibly 3. It was a little escape from life's crazy, busy days! Enjoy it, just don't expect too much.
