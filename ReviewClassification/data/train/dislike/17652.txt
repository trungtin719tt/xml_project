I really expected the book to jump right into Ayla's life and for her to be the main character and focus on her. I was extremely disappointed, however, to read about an entirely weird fantasy that didn't make sense to me. The next chapters went into Jondalar's life, and he seemed to be a bit boring. The chapters jumped around too quickly, telling me information which I did not find useful at all, especially since Ayla and Jondalar do not meet until about the end of the book. And the entire pet concept? It was as if the great book changed into a Flintstones children's book. I eventually stopped reading it. Still, how a great book had a great downfall surprises me to this day.
