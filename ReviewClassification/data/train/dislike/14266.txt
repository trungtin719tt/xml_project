I don't know who's 'definitely dead', but it's not Bill. Alas. Oh, wait, is that a spoiler? Yea, Bill lives. Or unlives. Whatever.In this book, Sookie ditches all the other guys after her to take up with the weretiger she met in the last book. She even manages to have sex this time. Well, mostly. No actual disrobing took place. At least, not in that scene.You may also remember this book as -- the one in which Sookie gets her period which will probably play a small role in the climax of the book.And I think there's a plot in there somewhere. Oh yea, Sookie's cousin died awhile ago, and you can read all about that in a short story which doesn't fit well into the continuity because her house is intact and yea, blah. And her cousin was shacking up with the Queen of Louisiana. And so Sookie has to go pack up her apartment and the Queen wants her for some stuff.And a bunch of people are horribly killed, because, hey, it's a Sookie Stackhouse book. If it's not sex, it's violence. And just because a vampire has lived for hundreds and hundreds of years is no reason they should keep on living with Sookie around!Oh yea, and Bill is more horrible than we thought. And Sookie's super special telepathic powers have a _reason_ behind them. And it also means she smells nice. And probably tastes nice. Because there's only one reason to keep a human girl around in a vampire book, and that's if she smells and/or tastes extra good.And, oh yea, Bill and Eric both sparkle.(Okay, I made that last part up.)
