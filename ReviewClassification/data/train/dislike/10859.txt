Wow. On *day 7* and loving this book so much. I want to slurp it up like a noodle.Finished: terrific; amazing teen voice and utterly believable characters -- the "mean girls" made, somehow, relatable! The story is so bittersweet, though I wished ...[SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT:]... for a different ending for the characters (of COURSE), as a reader, I found the ending very powerful. The cumulative grief of those left behind -- left entirely to the reader's imagination -- is haunting.And how wonderful is Kent? Love him. My new book boyfriend :-)
