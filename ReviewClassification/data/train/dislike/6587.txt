This book should be called Blahsingr because all it is is 800 pages of Blah Eragon, blah Roran, blah Arya, blah Orik, blah Galbatorix (which I'm certain is a new prescription drug for indigestion), blah, blah, blah.We all know Paolini killed his trilogy by turning it into a "cycle" but making us read through another 784 pages after his horrific second book, Eldest, was grounds for banishment to the Empire's dungeons.The book basically had no plot, just a bunch of diversions to keep you reading thinking something big was going to happen. Did I really have to read an entire chapter on how Eragon made his sword while an elf was controlling his body? Or all that super-cheesy heart-of-hearts rambling? And what of Katrina's father? Who cares??? It's a recap wherein no new characters or real plotlines emerge. Rather, the author spends his time further developing his characters and setting us up for the big finale - the showdown between Eragon and Galbatorix, and possibly something with Roran - like he'll become a Rider or hero of some sort due to his supernatural strength, and something with old Murtagh and Thorn - who just won't die. All of this will no doubt occur after we've read 600 more pages of recap in the final book of the cycle.Still, I have to keep reading because I know by the time two years passes and the final book comes out I'll have forgotten how lame two out of three of these books were and will pick it up and read the ending and hopefully be shocked to learn that Galbatorix wins and all that is good in the world is gone because that is the only way Paolini can surprise us at this point.
