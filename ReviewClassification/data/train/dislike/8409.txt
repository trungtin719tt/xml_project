If you want a cleaner review:https://rowansravingreviews.wordpress...Not so clean: Alright, so Loren Blake is possessive as fuck. He had controlled her. Cut himself and made her drink (not that she didn't want to) and then CUT HER and drank from her.... Yeah, and then was like, "Now let's finish the Imprint. Let's make love!" I was so disgusted... I literally can't even on how fucking vomit-provoking that scene was. I have read about sex, but this was all sorts of different. Loren Blake was, in this book, an ass.And then, Erik walked in on the second time... He got hella mad. Erik was also possessive, controlling, and argued with Zoey during every fucking chapter, I kid you not. *eye roll* I am so tired of Erik. He was okay in the first book, and in the second one, we didn't hear from him much, but in this one, he was dreadful. Aphrodite started to warn Zoey about how Erik was, but Zoey ignored all the red flags Aphrodite threw her way, and let all arguments go down. Good Gods, Zoey is annoying as Hell.So, I like Aphrodite now. She is my new favorite. The Twins are awesome, but come on, Aphrodite is much more realistic. She is dark and depressing, sarcastic, which are all things I love in a book character. Especially the sarcastic part. I loved her. She used to be a major bitch, truly, but now she's not to bad.OMG, I missed Stevie Rae so much! I cannot word on how much I missed her! She is really the best. I love her Okie accent and how she loved Kenny Chasney (? I dunno, who..) But it was all terrible. How she was that weird ass ghost vampire thing. Hopefully there will be a name for that weird shit later.Anyway, there is not much I can say about this book, just that it seems that it is worse than the other books.
