I rarely read or review romances. I like unusual books, and romances tend to run to formula. So when I got the request for this review, I had to take a look at what was being said about Mistress Suffragette on Goodreads. It sounded like there would be more emphasis on the context than I would normally find in a historical romance. This is why I accepted a review copy, and I am now posting an honest review.When we first meet Penelope Stanton, the protagonist of Mistress Suffragette, she's sheltered, spoiled and somewhat shallow. She makes the occasional witty remark, but frankly I found her thoroughly unsympathetic. I told myself she would improve when she stopped being under her mother's thumb. She did improve. She began to be more thoughtful. Yet throughout the novel, Penelope ends up being swayed by those who surround her. Some of her worst decisions could only be explained by the proximity of a strong minded individual over-riding her judgment. She seemed to lack self-determination.I preferred Verdana, a feminist activist that Penelope encounters after she leaves home. I liked her self-acceptance and genuine desire to help other women.So although there were characters and moments in Mistress Suffragette that pleased me, the book definitely did have flaws. Judging from reviews, some readers may overlook those issues. I am hoping that Diane Forbes learned from the experience of writing this book and will produce better work in the future.For my complete review seehttp://wwwbookbabe.blogspot.com/2017/...
