Oh my fucking God. This book. I was standing in the kitchen this morning angrily chopping veg and I couldn't work out why, then I realised, it was this book just making me irrationally angry, when I wasn't even reading it!Tragedies within the first 50 pages, let's list them.1. She gets a lovely doll!1.5 Doll is trashed.2. She gets sent to school at last!2.5 School is terrible she's beaten every day.3. It's ok she makes an awesome friend!3.5 Friend hates her, fuck you, nits.4. She realllly wants a blue teaset.4.5 Family gets themselves into debt buying it, she no longer wants it and it brings her no joy.5. I'm allowed to go to Church with the others!5.5 Fuck Church is boring I will never achieve spiritual fulfillment.6. My parents don't love me but my brother does. :36.5 My brother has tried to run off to War and is now irreparably broken.That was basically the whole book, over and over again. There was some shit about how priests should be allowed to marry because what is God if not Love and some other stuff about being married to the land and where babies come from. but it was mainly a series of setting up good things and then knocking them over again like a game of tragic-bowling.At one point they meet the priest, he is like "fuck your hair is sexy darlin'" ignoring the fact she is Nine. He lusts after her for the rest of the book but he is Married to God and the author takes pains to mention how he can never get it up, several times. Apart from about 4 days in a honeymoon hotel bareback where he never again considers he could have made her pregnant, even when being faced with his own son for several hours a day for 10 years. Nobody ever says "fuck man he looks just like you," and never once does he think "You know she left her husband right close to when this kid was conceived right about the time of those 4 days in a honeymoon hotel"Oh man I'm not going to go into it. Don't read it. Please.
