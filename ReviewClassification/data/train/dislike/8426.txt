When I found the word "cedars" 7 times on a 2 page spread, I shut down. The language is simple; maybe I'm supposed to perceive it as deep, mysterious, or simply written in a beautiful way, but I just found it dull. I was so tired of hearing about snow and cedars.I think it had a trial in it, and a Japanese fisherman, and some discrimination; maybe it happened in an internment camp in Washington state or something. Or maybe the main character is investigating his father's involvement in a trial in the 1940's. I don't remember. My book club read it and our discussion of it was not very interesting.Funny- I just read a review by Gina- she called the language flowery and gave this example:"By October San Piedro had slipped off its summer reverler's mask to reveal a torpid, soporific dreamer whose winter bed was made of wet green moss....The gutters filled with rust-colored pine needles and the pungent effluvium of alder leaves, and the drainpipes splashed with the winter rain."I guess I just skim over this flowery language because it's so meaningless to the story. If I want imagery, I'll read some poetry, not this snowy cedary schlock. This language is flowery to the point of making no sense- a waste of the reader's time to ask them to parse out the convoluted imagery.Another reviewer on this site said the book had endless narration- I agree- it needed less description of the scenery and more about the characters and time period.
