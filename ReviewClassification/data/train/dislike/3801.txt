UPDATE: In celebration of my good friend Saha joining GoodReads I am re-posting my review of Fallen.**********************************So...Whoelsewas sucked in to this one by the cover?Actually,Fallenwas recommended to me by a friend who had almost had a conniption whilst telling me how 'spectacular' it was. And because I value this particular friend to the highest possible degree I assumed she would never subject me to anything that would fill me with the desire to RIP MY OWN BRAIN CELLS OUT and feed them to my cat.As it happens, I was wrong.I readFallenabout a year ago and I'm only now reviewing it due to all the recent fuss about the sequels. But for the life of me I can't actually remember whatthehallapalooza happened in the story.As in, obviously I remember reading it and I vaguely recall the characters and such, but the plot... em. Was there a one?I'm determined to discover the answer to this question, and so I have reached into the deep, dark, scary corners of my memory:Luce moves to new school.(original)Luce meets Daniel.Luce is perplexed when Daniel flips her the bird.Luce cries.Luce has an epic stroke of genius and begins stalking Daniel.Luce cries some more.Luce has numerous encounters with Daniel in various dark, deserted locations.Luce is puzzled.Luce is still crying.*a bazillion pages later*Luce finally cottons on that Daniel is adouche-canoeI mean(view spoiler)[fallen angel(hide spoiler)].Luce does nothing whatsoever with this information.Elle punches Luce in the face.THE END.Did I miss anything?FYI: The one star is for the cover.Although, *looks closer* LUCE. IS. STILL. CRYING.
