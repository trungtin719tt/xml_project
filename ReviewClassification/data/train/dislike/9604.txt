THIS IS ACTUALLY ZERO stars, but it won't be listed if I put zero, so, just so you know - ZERO!.I thought this was going to be a really entertaining read, but I'm giving up. The main character makes no sense, whatsoever. We're told that she isn't able to do magic and then she does magic. Huh???And then we have the vampire sneaking in her window and watching her sleep, fascinated by her sleeping. Where have I read this before? Let's see....... can anyone think of where they might have read this? Anyone?I don't care that she glows when she sleeps. I already know it's because it's linked to her ignoring her magic or because it's trapped inside her or because she's simply too cheap to buy a nightlight(yes, I made that last one up), but I'm not really intrigued enough to find out.What I've learned thus far is that the author is very proud of her knowledge of Oxford and the library there. I could have used far less information about walking around the town, where she goes rowing, where she's sitting in the library for gosh sakes and other unimportant minutiae.I got this book before it was listed as part of a trilogy.BEWARE, series alert.Imighthave found the energy to finish this one off, but I can't imagine reading three books like this one. Nope, not gonna do it.Fifty pages. That's it. Thank you and good night!Had to create a brand new shelf for this one: "books-i-choose-not-to-finish"On the positive side, I'VE DONE IT! I've actually stopped reading a book that I felt was a waste of time. I didn't think I would, but I did it. (Yes, I know it's a small thing to celebrate, but I'm going to do my happy dance anyway!)
