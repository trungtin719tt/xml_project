To the Casts: I really enjoy this series, but this was a bit much. Too much "boy issue", we get it she always has to deal with multiple attachments. Get back into the actually intriguing mythology you have developed. This story was only about 2 days, best I can tell, and again we are left on the edge. Button it up please!
