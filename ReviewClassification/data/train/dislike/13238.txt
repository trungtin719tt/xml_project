2.5 "This Champagne has gone flat and don't tell me that Vanilla is from Madagascar" stars !!In my late teens I read all of Mr. Forster's books and although not my favorites I enjoyed them thoroughly. I wanted to re-read one at random and see what my forty-something self thought and felt. Alas, this particular reading of Howard's End did not hold up for me the way I had expected it too.I want to to be clear though that I found parts of it sparkling but the majority of it was simply ho-hum and did not stand the test of time.This is a novel that writes about particular substrates of class in early twentieth Century England. We have the cultured and idle rich, the brash and industrious nouveau riche and the struggling working classes. There is also commentary on city vs. rural living, relations between the genders and the superiority of anything British over anything continental never mind foreign. A novel about social commentary and where England was headed during that period of time. This is all very good but Mr. Forster forces it down our throats between absolutely brilliant and hilarious dialogue that if left alone would have stood on their own in a thought provoking and very pleasant way.The characters are not well drawn out, the men are either blustering dominants, idle entitled layabouts or over-romantic zealots. The women are mostly hysterical, over-emotional, irrational and if sensible than dull either in appearance or imagination or intelligence. The plot is convenient.This novel does shine though in its dialogue and some of the description of both cityscape and rural living as well as the quirky descriptions of some of the more minor characters.An enjoyable read that to me is more a bagatelle than a substantial sonata.
