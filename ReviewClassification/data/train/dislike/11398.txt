1.5I don't really read much from this genre so I really tried to be openminded about it. The story was flat for me, no character depth, the story felt scattered, and I really found myself not caring what happened. The writing flow and rapid change of POV was a real issue for me. If I hadn't of needed this for two challenges I probably would of DNF it. The only good thing I can say is that at least it was short.
