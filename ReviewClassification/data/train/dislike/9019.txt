DNFed half way through. When the hero takes the heroine to his love shack hotel room filled with love toys where he's had many women in the past, I decided this book wasn't for me. There's no emotional connection between the hero and heroine, just sex and more sex.Also the writing seems disjointed and stilted at times. Had a hard time following.Seems way too much like Fifty Shades and makes me think the author jumped on the Fifty Shades bandwagon.
