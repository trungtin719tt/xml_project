Peter PanmeetsSix of Crows(a younger version) meetsThe Boxcar Childrenin modern-day Venice with a slight twist of fantasy near the end, in this gripping adventure tale of two brothers and their unexpected friends... especially a mysterious boy named Scipio. I adored how Prosper looked after Bo--it made me happy. (Also, pet tortoises! Poor Victor. XD)Solid 4 stars throughout, might have made it to 5 stars if it had ended how I wanted... As it is, it's being kept from a disappointed-2-stars currently by remembering that I liked it most of the time and by pretending there's a missing chapter afterward. :P(In which...[alternate ending of my own imagination... don't read]:(view spoiler)[Scipio tracks down the merry-go-round and fixes it just long enough to turn his proper age again. Victor keeps the shop and marries Ida and they adopt all five kids (since Mosca and Riccio in this make-believe-missing-chapter also change their minds and come back to the others). Scipio in his proper young age is happy and confident and takes over the detective business like a non-thief version of his theatrical Thief Lord self. And they all live happily ever after.(hide spoiler)]That's what happens in the chapter that doesn't exist, after the end, which I maintain should/could happen. *coughcough* ...It all COULD still happen! I insist. Ahem. *folds arms stubbornly*)Basically other than a couple discontentments about the ending ((view spoiler)[specifically, Scipio being semi-grown-up... that's the main one... and wanting Ida and Victor to officially be a thing since they're perfect, and wanting the whole group to still be together(hide spoiler)]), it was a great read. I just... am evidently enormously picky about my endings. &gt;.&gt; *cough* Obviously a flaw of mine... Somewhat disappointed, but I can pretend a missing chapter continuing the ending, so. XD
