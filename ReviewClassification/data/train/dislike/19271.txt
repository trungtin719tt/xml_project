NEVER AGAIN WILL I HAVE TO READ ANOTHER BOOK IN THIS SERIES! I'm sorry, i'm just so excited that it's over. I could rant and rave about all the plot holes and "plot surprises" (i.e the surprises that you could easily guess 1/4 of the way through the book) but i won't. I will leave it at this- For the sake of your sanity, don't read this series. In fact, don't read ANY books by her.
