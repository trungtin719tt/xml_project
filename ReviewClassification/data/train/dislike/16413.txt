Whoopsie daisy, it's unpopular opinion time again. As I scroll through the Goodreads page of this book, I only find raving reviews. Four and five stars aplently, a rare three stars at the least. And here I am, positively convinced that Neil Gaiman is a terrific author, yet the two books I've read of him were completely underwhelming.Thing is, I have no idea what the hell I just read. It was bizarre and weird and, quite frankly, not in a good way.But I am not giving up. Iwillfind a Neil Gaiman book to love. Iwill.
