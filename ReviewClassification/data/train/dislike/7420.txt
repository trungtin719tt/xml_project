I'm not a fan of romance, but that didn't stop me from lovingAll the Bright Places,The Fault in Our Stars, orI'll Give You the Sun. The thing about those books is, they're really about death, more death, and family respectively. Romance is just a small part of the story.Anna and the French Kiss, on the other hand, doesn't have much else going for it, but somehow it works in the beginning.Your first impression of Anna is that she's this clever tour guide to Paris, France. She wittily introduces herself, and then in only a few pages meets her own personal Mr. Perfect. Even though it's cliche--their interactions together are beyond cute, they're excellently written by Stephanie Perkins. By the mid point, you start thinking maybe a story purely about romance could work, I mean how couldn't you, when your heart is stopping with Anna's as she anxiously waits for Etienne to make a first move.But then Etienne's life takes a drastic change, some MAJOR family issues arise, and the way Anna handles the situation (like an obnoxious self-centered basic teen brat) makes you question why you ever cared about her in the first place. Especially by the end, when she's sadistically gaining pleasure by making her love interest suffer. How is a reader supposed to root for that??Not only doesAnna and the French Kisstumble to an awkward and ridiculous finish with back-to-back first fights, but it spreads a pretty unhealthy idea of how a relationship works. No matter how fun some of parts are, no matter how good the writing is at times, no matter how swoon-worthy the love interest is, I just can't.
