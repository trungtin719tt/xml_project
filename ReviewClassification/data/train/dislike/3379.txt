I just re-read the book before watching the movie. I'm sure I read it as a kid, but I'm reviewing this as an adult.This book is sad. It's like My Girl. The characters are innocent and fun, and the world they create with their minds is playful. However, tragedies of this kind are not my thing. It seems that the point of the book is the tragedy, to have a boy's friend die. I'd rather spend my time reading something a little more up-beat.I've said this before, I don't at all mind characters dying, and I love certain tragedies. This one is just a little too simple to really fire me up, and it just succeeds in making me depressed.
