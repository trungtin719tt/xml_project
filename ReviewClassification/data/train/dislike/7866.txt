At page 246, I'm throwing the towel in on this one. It's not that it's bad, it's really not. I just can't seem to get excited about it, and after this many pages, I want to be more eager to pick it up. I'm just not interested enough to find out what happens in the next 500 pages or so. I have so many other books screaming for my attention. Now this book is classified as fantasy and I don't usually read this genre. That's not to say I have never enjoyed a fantasy novel - I have in fact enjoyed a handful. In fact, The Hobbit is one of my favorite books of all time. I felt some real magic deep down while reading that book. The same is true for Mary Stewart's Merlin series, beginning with The Crystal Cave. I experienced a more meaningful connection with those books. It's just not happening here. Some may love it - don't discount this if you are at all interested. Keep in mind that the beloved Harry Potter series never attracted my attention either (although I have to admit that you are right, perhaps I don't know what I'm missing!) There is some great writing going on here, but I need something more to charm my little heart. I will refrain from rating this one since I didn't make it to the halfway mark.
