Ok I have read 4 of the 5 Dan Brown books and I have come up with a user friendly recipe that anyone can use to create their own pulp fiction Dan Brown creation.Add 1 strong, intelligent, attractive career woman.Add 1 semi-strong, (but not as strong as the woman) man, that is semi-sucessful in his chosen career path (but not as successful as the woman) attractive, sensitive and totally not threatened by the strong intelligent woman.Mix these two well but don't over mix because they will spend most of the book kinda liking each other, but not in a way that de-tracts from the main storyline even though its obvious that at the end they will end up in each other arms/beds, but not in a shades of grey kind of way.Add 2 strong older, successful authoritative men, that are firm but fair and take the strong intelligent woman seriously, mentor here but are protective because they:a. secretly love her or b. see her as a daughter replacement.Add a sprinkling of other characters that move the storyline along, add some comic value but you don't really have to invest much time or thought into.Add a large helping of historical/scientific facts that are inaccurate (or that sound pretty accurate to the non-educated reader) or have stolen from an already written, less reader friendly, non-fiction book that not many people know about or have read.Add a splash of professional killer/killers hunting down the main characters, but are obviously not professional enough to kill them off.Mix all ingredients together and select a couple of back drops that are slightly exotic and may help the tourism industry in this particular location.Cook ingredients for 400-600 pages with short chapters that move back and forth between scenes, ensuring the low attention span reader does not get too bored.Finally serve with a 'twist' that the evil person hunting them down/causing the drama is one of the old trusted guys that the strong woman trusted and is totally shocked and devastated but leaves no lasting or significant psychological impacts or male trust issues.Voila; you now have a big chunk of Dan Brown magic!
