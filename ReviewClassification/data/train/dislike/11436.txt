If you have been following me, then you knowI've been rereading books. Most of them have been big fails, and one or two have approved, but this is not the point in here. What I mean to say is that I read this book as part of that experiment of mine AND for another reason too. Can you guess what'sthe second reason?Yeah, it's the movie.To be honest, I hated the first one: It was boring, VERY different to the book (andI didn't particularly lovethat one), etc. BUT, I can never resist it. When there's a movie coming for a book I have read (even if there's still a long time to wait), I get excited. I get excited even if I disliked the book.Anyway, that's just why I read the book. Now, what do I have to say?1. Where, oh where did all the emotion from the first book go?I said in my review for The Maze Runner that it was predictable and boring at some times, but I can't deny there was sometimes a feel of thrill - adrenaline, if you want it like that. In this one...NOTHING HAPPENED! We get this rubbish about WHY ARE WE HERE? WHY IS TERESA GONE? WHAT IS GROUP B? OH MY GOD, WHAT IS HAPPENING?!?Ugh, no. I guess this book is just another victim of the middle book syndrome, in which it's just a pointless waste of paper (and money).2. Characters... again.Oh, noes, Thomas, you again with your Gary Stu-ish personality, but now it gets even worse. Why? Because we have love interest #2 introduced and she is...Brenda!She has no personality, she's boring and annoying. Worse even, she's just... there. Her role in the book is... nothing. I mean, nothing besides being the second option for Thomas. Plus, she sounded EXACTLY like Teresa, so aside being a pointless character, she was a carbon copy of another boring character.Also, Jorge. What the hell? Was it just me or did he also sound like Minho? And how about Aris? He was like another Thomas!But Thomas wins the medal for the most annoying character in this book.3. Stop with the useless plot twists.Seriously, though, this book was even more plagued of plot twists to which an explanation was never given. Add to that plot holes. Why do you mention something you are not going to deepen? And I'm talking about the plague. We get a very little explanation as to what it is, but we never know how it appeared, how it is spread, etc. All we know is that it's deadly and contagious. That's all.This get me to the world building, which gets ZERO points. There are NO EXPLANATIONS for ANYTHING. First that plague I was talking about, then about the society itself, then about W.I.C.K.E.D (seriously, that acronym is ridiculous). They never explain how the society came to be how it is, and that aspect is CRUCIAL for a dystopian book.4. The ending was really wtf and ridiculous.I laughed at it. Why? Because cliched. That's my answer. Besides, it was anticlimactic and (again) precipitated. Why can't you take your time into ending the book without rushing? It feels forced and it just kills whatever emotion (that was not present in me, btw) the reader had up until that point. And also, it felt as if the author didn't know what else to add so TELEPATHY WOO-HOO!So yeah, in summary, this was boring, cliched, pointless and laughable. My verdict? Damn you Vane for starting the 2015 rereads.
