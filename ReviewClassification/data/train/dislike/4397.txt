$1.99 on US Amazon: July 23, 2016.I've had this on my TBR list for a couple years now and was thinking of deleting it since it's a "middle grade" book and I'm getting old, but then I read this in the blurb:Gail Carson Levine's examination of traditional female roles in fairy tales takes some satisfying twists and deviations from the original. Ella is bound by obedience against her will, and takes matters in her own hands with ambition and verve. Her relationship with the prince is balanced and based on humor and mutual respect; in fact, it is she who ultimately rescues him.Nope, it's staying on my list.
