2/5stars1/5starsJan 7 edit: I've dropped it from 2 to 1 star cause I legit can't think of anything I liked in this book or anything that didn't make me angry or go "what the fuck"I don't... GET it.This is my second of Palahniuk's novels and with both i've come away being like "wtf was that" and not in a "wow this author is brilliant and smart and i'm too lowly to understand their meaning" but more of an actual "what the FUCK was that?"I'm a big fan of the weird and wacky; I love magical realism, I love books with huge, insane plot twists that other people think came out of left field, and I FEEL LIKE i should be a big fan of Palaniuk. I have one more book by him that I'll give a chance, but after that, we done Chuck.This was just... I don't know why but this lowkey reminded me of an adult John Green. Not in the plot obviously lol but the way these characters are. They're all so unnecessarily quirky and dumb for no other reason than to be quirky and dumb, and they'd pull these stupid ass one-liners out of their pockets that middle school kids would definitely read and nod and go "wow thats so deep" bUT ITS NOT. The characters annoyed me in the same ways that JG's characters always piss me off.also I GET it, I THINK this is supposed to be satire(??) who knows I might be wrong but like whatever Palahniuk's message is supposed to be flew RIGHT OVER MY HEAD like wtf was the point of this. enlighten me. cause i don't think there is a point. Also the use of LGBT people and issues in this book was RIDIC and I talk about it more in the spoilers part if you haven't read the book but want to know about it.my next complaints are spoilers so:(view spoiler)[ -How is this book being read recently and people aren't SCREAMING over a character literallygetting a sex change and becoming transfor attention and for the lols? That entire section where Brandy is explaining her/himself (like, what pronouns do we use? The book uses she but they don't want to be a girl????) and all like oh I want to torture myself so i made the worst mistake i could think of just asdjslkadjasdlasjdlkj FUCK OFF. like did i miss something? did i miss where this was okay????- Wow the parents were horrible they were literally using their son dying as a way to get attention wow- i get one of the points of the book is about attention but I COULDN'T STAND IT ANYMORE- the ending was super lame. like no i didn't see it coming but wow that was fucking stupid.(hide spoiler)]do not recommend. I'll be giving "choke" a try just cause I already have it but if it isn't vastly better than these other two books I've read by him i'll be done.
