I picked this book off the self to read at work as I am determined to familiarize myself with the collection more and because it's a "classic" and on the ALA banned book list.While reading I often found myself thinking..."What? No 16 year old girl says that. This was obviously a part the editors edited heavily." Then I realized how often I was thinking that. The whole thing struck me as oddly UNrealistic even though it was supposed to be a real account. (And is shelved in our non-fiction section.)It was only after doing some additional research that I discovered that most people do consider the book to be a work of fiction and that it's proclaimed "editor" is the real author.Overall, I say read it more for its historical value than anything else. For god's sake don't read it as a piece of anti-drug propaganda. It just is too heavy-handed to ring true. And boy does it make acid trips sound like fun! I find the reviews that gloss over the fact that this book is fiction (and badly researched fiction at that) because "it delivers a good message" ridiculous. It delivers a false message and I wonder how many kids could really relate to it today.
