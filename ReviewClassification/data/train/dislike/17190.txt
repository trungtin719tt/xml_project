One thing I hate is when a series is written by different authors who pretend to be the main author (to sell books and make loads of $$$) but they don't bother reading the previous books in that particular series.FOr instance, Ari suddenly can't read yet in the previous book, he signed his name as Wolverine with great relish. The list goes on...but enough whining.Max is still with group. Has chip removed by Dr. A. Martinez and later gets caught with posse and goes back into the "school". Meantime, Fang starts a web blog that is followed by everyone,...including L.A. gang members who offer them refudge and assist in bashing the flyboys (those who replaced the erasers). Grown-ups messed up the world and there are scientists who want to purify it and get rid of more than half the world's population to do so. BTW, they want a new and superior race to do so. Our favorite mutants are to be exterminated.Speaking of extermination, all the erasers have been terminated and the only one left is Ari. Why?...because his expiration date popped up on the back of his neck so that means, "hey, he's Jeb's son and he's going to die anyway so let's show some kindness". He literally saves Max, Angel (who temporarily pretends to go to the dark side), Fang, Gasman, Iggy, and Nudge. While doing so, Ari is physically hurt and Max takes him with her during their escape. This angers Fang so the boys and the girls split up. Ari is later discovered to be Max's half brother and Mrs. A. Martinez was a scientist who gave Jeb her egg and was therefore Max's real mom. Mrs. Martinez was never sure so she is not to be blamed in any shape or form. Jeb finally cries when Ari dies and I guess Jeb finally sees his son as a 7 yr old mutant but foremost, his son.Max and gang kick a$$ and save the world and eats lots of French food. Max and Fang make up and all is good again.Getting weak as the series go on. At least hire writers who truly follow the series!
