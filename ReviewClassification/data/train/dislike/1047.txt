Absolute Trash.I can't be bothered to write a long review so I'll just say my main reason for not liking it.I hate emotionally manipulative stories and I hate it when books become overly sentimental and depressing. Okay, I geddit, it's sad. She was raped and murdered. But guess what, I couldn't give a rats arse anymore. Shut up and go back to Heaven. Don't possess someone you went to school with and force her to have sex with your nearly boyfriend. Because that is rape. That bit turned a silly story into an utterly stupid story.Ugh. I gave it to charity. On reflection, I should have burnt it.What a waste of my money.
