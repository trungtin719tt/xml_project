"Exciting, high-tension stories. I love these books." - Stephen KingWelp, I guess this is going to be another one that I just don't get the hype over. I really wanted to like this, and it's notbad.It's just not that good either.It doesn't seem like much of anything happened. It's likeUnder the DomemeetsLord of the Flies, only way suckier. There's nothing wrong with the writing, but I sure must have missed all the "exciting, high-tension" sections S.K. was talking about.558 pages, seriously? This book did not need to be so long. I didn't really care for any of the characters, except a few were really annoying. It barely even went into why they were stuck and what was the cause of it. It started to get interesting and then - IT ENDED. Yep. So, you'd have to keep going to find out what is going on because you didn't get any answers with this one.The mutating animals and mutant powers the kids got was interesting, but it just didn't seem to go anywhere. I can't even really tell you what happened because NOTHING really happened. Well, okay, we get to read about the different groups of kids that form up - some are good and some are bad and mean. Sigh.They get the local McDonald's up and running and run out of buns. There's a few bully fights and some talking coyotes... I don't know, I guess it's just me. This was really MEH. Bigtime.$1.99 on Amazon Kindle: 10 DEC 2015. I love me some dystopians.
