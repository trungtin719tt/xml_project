I'm glad this was quite a fast read, because I didn't find it all that enjoyable. I disliked the main characters (from the beginning I thought Vivi was arrogant, selfish, manipulative and someone who finds herself better, more important and more deserving than others, and I found Sidda whiny. I wanted to shake her and tell her to grow up and stop whining and feeling sorry for herself and get over it) and the writing wasn't that good either. It felt like a lot of blablabla, especially the parts involving adult Sidda. I did like the parts describing Vivi's life as a girl, in the Lousiana of the 30s and 40s and 50s, and I like the close friendship the Ya-Ya's had, lasting for 60 years.
