For a book that is based entirely on the idea of love, is incredibly dull.Delirium was well written and the idea was good, but in my opinion, it fails to deliver.The development of the story falls through.The main problem to me is that the book is not passionate or surprising, there isno intensity. It is too mild, it has no real action, emotional tension or excitement, it just rolls nice and easy right until the end (although it doesn't feel like an end to me) when the writer goes and decides to cut the book right in the middle of the climax. One thing is finish a book with a cliffhanger and another to just cut a book in the middle of the action without any real resolution.The story and characters are bland.Lena(the female lead) is mild, ingenuous and clueless. She seems way younger, is too naive.Alexneeds a shake, he needs to wake up and grow a personality.Also, it seems to me that this book is better directed towards early teens, like from 12 to 14. I think this book can't hold the interest up for people older than 15.In conclusion, this novel could have been much more special just with a bit more deepness and some intensity. What a pity.It wasn't terrible, it was just mediocre and definitely forgettable.Delirium did not engage me so I will not read the sequel.
