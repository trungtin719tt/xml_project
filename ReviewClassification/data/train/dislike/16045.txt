This book is so fucking stupid that I lost IQ points while reading it. The only reason I didn't DNF it was for the joke material. Because, seriously, this book has to be a joke, right?The premise had some potential - vampires who came over on the Mayflower, come into their vampireyness at age 15,and are reincarnated over and over again. (?)There are exactly 400 of them, and our special snowflake is a new one!Oh no! Not a New Soul!? (again...)So, of course the powers that be are suspicious of snowflake. (...anyone?)Our special snowflake's name is Schuyler. That's right, Schuyler. I know, right? I'm so sick of girls named Schuyler! We had like 6 of them in my homeroom class in school.So, of course Snowflake goes to an exclusive school that only the richest of all rich kids go to. And, of course she is an outcast who is suddenly noticed by the hottest jock in school. And, of course she has a boy best friend who is secretly in love with her. And, of course there is a mean-girl club that hates her. And, of course there is a modeling casting call at her school that all of the girls go to but they pick Schuyler to be the next supermodel as she just happens to be walking by because she's soooooooo beautiful.I mean, come on, those things are just a given. Duh!But, the best part of this book? The thing that will give you mind-numbing pain that only killing all of these asshole characters can alleviate? The endless, and I mean pages and pages of, designer label names that are listed. We know what every character is wearing at all times - each piece, underwear included - and what designer made it. And, the ridiculous descriptions of opulence that we are supposed to believe that these vampire teens live in. Really? It doesn't matter that they are 15, you will serve them cocktails from the bar if they are rich? Oh, and don't forget the heated almonds. Rich bitches love warm nuts.Oh, Mr. Peanut, you are so hot!The only good news about this book is that it's only a couple hundred pages long.
