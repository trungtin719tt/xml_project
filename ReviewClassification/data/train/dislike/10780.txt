Another free download from the library. Read by Robertson Dean &amp; Yuri Rasovsky."I Am Legend"is a classic, of course. If you've only heard about this story &amp; never actually read it, you're missing a lot. Vincent Price's rendition (1963?) in "The Last Man On Earth" wasn't bad, but neither of the other two movies did any justice to the story. They completely missed the horribly real, poignant point. Charleton Heston's "The Omega Man" (1970?) was fun &amp; campy, but Will Smith's movie that was named for the book should be burned. Awful CGI, stupid endings, &amp; monsters. Blech.I skipped through this a bit since I've read it several times, the last not long ago, &amp; the reader had a habit of whispering which doesn't work well in the car. I loved hearing the end again, though. Wow! Only 4 stars because the readers messed it up."Buried Talents"- I don't get it. Am I just dense? I think the guy tossing the balls is(view spoiler)[ a robot. No sweat, perfect aim, same bowl, etc..(hide spoiler)]But what's the point? If anyone knows, please tell me, otherwise this was a waste of time."The Near Departed"- OK, kind of cute, but I saw it coming. Everybody loves her, eh? LOL!"Prey"- I think this was a Twilight Zone. Excellent, as are most of those stories."Witch War"is nasty on several levels both gross &amp; subtle. I've read it before &amp; was impressed. Too much performance by the readers, though."Dance of the Dead"didn't seem to come across well in this medium. I think I got the point, but it was quite weak, if I did."Dress of White Silk"had way too much performance by the reader. A good, horrible story with an interesting, subtle build."Mad House"was far, far, far too long &amp; the end was obvious from the first. Worse, the reader performed too much again. Skip it."The Funeral"is a funny story &amp; not bad. It's a shame the reader put in unintelligible accents. I couldn't understand one character at all &amp; two others were iffy."From Shadowed Places"was OK. Interesting with some elements that could easily have gotten out of hand, but didn't. Nothing terribly new, but good for all that."Person to Person"was pretty good. I can't say much without a spoiler, but it had me wondering &amp; I loved the end.Overall, I can't recommend this audiobook. "I Am Legend" is totally worth it, but was probably done by a better reader. The rest of the stories were hit &amp; miss. It didn't help that the readers mangled the stories. I generally don't want a lot of performance art from a reader - Jim Dale reading Harry Potter is a rare exception - or I might as well watch a movie. Reading is about my imagination running rampant guided by the author's words. When the reader uses an accent or incorrect tone, it knocks my imagination for a loop. These two were awful, IMO.Also, Blackstone just ripped this off the CD to file which meant that some stories had a repetitious sentence or two as we went from one file to the other. They couldn't be bothered to reformat it to a file per section for "I Am Legend" and one for each story. Jerks. It wouldn't have taken much time or effort to clean &amp; break up these files properly. That's shoddy.
