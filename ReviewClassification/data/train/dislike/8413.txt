I only keep this book around because I started reading it, which means I have to finish. I only read it when I'm taking a bath. There's no need to waste my precious time on this garbage any other waking moment.First off, it's so badly written it makes me want to pull my hair out. The immature, inane dialogue is so stupid and ridiculous, it makes me feel embarrassed for the writer, who is obviously trying way to hard to sound like a cool teenager, when in fact, it makes her sound the way Drew Barrymore dressed in that movie "Never Been Kissed." She makes up words that a 12 year old might say, like "ginormic." And Zoey, the 16-17ish year old main character, refuses to swear and says things like "darn it" while she's sleeping with her older teacher. Oh, garsh, I'm such a ho-bag now!Gag me. Seriously. Make this end. Nobody that age calls someone a "hateful hag" OK? Quit trying to make "hag" happen, Cast. It's not happening.Zoey is not a heroine. She is a bad role model for any impressionable teen that might read this. She feels guilty for being such a ho-bag while porking her teacher, cheating on both her boyfriends. Wow.And exactly why does everyone hate Aphrodite? Because she's a ho-bag for blowing her (ex)boyfriend? Eeewy, she put his pee-pee in her mouth. Oh my god, I almost rolled my eyes right out of my head after reading the first book. But now look at Little Miss Hypocrite, spreading em' for Mr. Teacher.I hate this series so much, that when I'm done reading this Book 3 in the bath, I plan on dunking it in the water so that no one else may ever be as unfortunate as I am to read this steaming pile of rhino feces.What are they - vampires or witches? Cool tattoos and no fangs. Might as well fucking sparkle in the sun, while they're at it. Blow me, Kristin and PC Cast. Blow me like the ho-bags you all are.
