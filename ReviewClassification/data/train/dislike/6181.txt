Pardon me for raining on the dystopian parade but I'm 5 chapters inand- already the plot development and progression seem patently obvious.I thinkBecause I'm assuming the republic had Metias killed, pinned it on Day just so they could send June to track and kill Day.I'm also guessing the two will fall in love, fight the bad guys aka "The Republic", then become the symbolic heads of the resistance.
