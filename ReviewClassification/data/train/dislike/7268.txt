This is a reallyterriblebook. It's even worse than the wholeTwilightandEragonseries combined together. The plot is extremely obnoxious, it features cardboard characters, and it has awfully absurd twists. It's dialogues are really horrible, like an old man trying very hard to sound young. this book isvery,very,verybadly written. A 12 year old could probably do better. Thebattle scenes, if you could call them that, are also poorly written and not realistic. Not even in the least. This book is oh-so very boring and fails to entertain. Also, most of the plot was wasted on insignificant fillers. I won't recommend this book to anyone.
