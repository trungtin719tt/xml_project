I hate not to finish reading a book I've started, so I went on and finished it fast. Sigh. I really wanted to likeThe Thirteenth Tale, for one I was reading with my friend Vessey. Besides that, there was a lot in the story for me to enjoy: an antiquarian bookstore; a lonely protagonist whose best friends are books, plus a secondary character who is a mysterious, isolated writer. And some nice passages, like:"There is something about words. In expert hands, manipulated deftly, they take you prisoner. Wind themselves around your limbs like spider silk, and when you are so enthralled you cannot move, they pierce your skin, enter your blood, numb your thoughts. Inside you they work magic."But it was not enough. It might be me, but the story simply fell flat and I found myself either upset to read about how abandoned the twins were (as a mother that did not come easy) or wondering about everything else but the pages in front of me. I'm sorry Ms. Setterfield.
