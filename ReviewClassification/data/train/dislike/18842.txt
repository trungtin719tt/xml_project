What a strange book.So here's this teenage girl named Zara who memorizes phobias just for the hell of it. She chants them when she is nervous. It calms her down. It was interesting at first. You know, to be aware of so many bizarre phobias out there. However, it got simply annoying and it wouldn't relate to anything in the story. They were so random.Then there's this Mary Sue (Gary Stu?) of a love interest named Nick who is macho, huge, unbelievably good looking and just glides through ice with this feet (It's really because he wears boots like a sensible human being, not heels like the silly girl.) so gracefully. He's basically very controlling and very Edwardish.Very Edwardish.Then there's this seemingly BA grandmother named Betty White. LOL. Betty White. She knows karate, I believe. She's very fit. And she talks like a 20-year-old woman. She claims that she will kick anyone's butt if they mess with her only grandaughter.That's utterly silly. Since when were grandmothers that BA? Or is it just that I am stuck with a mean, gossipy Indian one and I cannot do anything about it?Then there are these really annoying, weird characters that made me cringe. That Issie girl that made me want to choke someone. That Ian guy that existed for no reason. And Megan, the evil, jealous witch.That's purrty much it, peeps. I just couldn't finish this.
