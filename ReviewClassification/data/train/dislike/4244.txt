Did not finish; stopped at page 208.I could not get behind America who is suffering from an affliction called TSTL syndrome (too stupid to live.) Her choices seem robotic and awkward, her dialogue and self-deprication feel desperate and forced. None of the other characters rise to the occasion of acting realistically, either.Besides that, and a serious lack of world building, The Selection is to The Hunger Games as Carrier of the Mark is to Twilight. That is to say an apparent knock-off. Gavril and Caesar are the same personality to a T.I tried to finish this one, but not finishing a novel speaks loudly to its readability and I do not knock any reviewer who still presents their opinions without first finishing the book. Not finishing a book says to me, I-Didn't-Like-It. A well written review tells me why.***I would also like to say what a huge fan of Kiera's vlogs I am and how surprised I was that this book lacked her exuberant personality.
