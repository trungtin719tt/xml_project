I have decided to delete this review. It was not my intention to upset anyone who either suffered from the disorder discussed in this book nor anyone related to such a person (See comment 270).Nonetheless, I still believe this to be a particularly poorly written book that contains more saccharine than substance.Still, if it brings you some sense of comfort - more strength to you.I have chosen not to delete the comments thread as not all of the comments are mine to delete.
