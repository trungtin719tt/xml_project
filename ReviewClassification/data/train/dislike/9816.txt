The one where Aislinn can see faeries that no one else can see, and they're awful. But the young Summer King, Keenan (srsly, Keenan), wants her to be his queen, and if things go wrong, they're going to go very wrong.I described this book to someone as "like mediocre fanfiction," and now I'm trying to pin down exactly what that means. First, of course, it means the book is quite self-indulgent when it comes to everyone being Special and having special names and special facial piercings and special eclectic reading habits and playlists (which are described in great detail) and so on.Second, there's a very high level of what you might call emotional explicitness -- which means not only that the feelings are told rather than shown, but that everybodyknowswhat they feel; nobody is confused or ambivalent or maintaining a successful wall of denial.Third, an awful lot of what passes for conflict is actually meaningless, whiny rebellion. Keenan faces off his mother, and it says, "He couldn't afford to let her browbeat him," and so his courageous stand consists of clenching his teeth and saying, "Someday I'll win! Someday I'll beat you!" And then his companion has to meet up with his mother and doexactly the same thing.I have to admit, I'm curious to know exactly what all the hints amount to -- what she has to say about Faery culture. But not curious enough.
