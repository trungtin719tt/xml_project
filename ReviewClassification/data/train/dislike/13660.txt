My Travis and his Pigeon:"Leaving emotions at the door, and replacing it with numbness, or anger - which was much easier to control - was easy. Letting yourself feel made you vulnerable."This is Travis's motto. He thinks that people ruled by emotions are weak. He is rough boy, living carefree life, depending on noone. He has his ideal girl dreamed-of in his head, he has just never met her yet. Until Abby comes into his life. She is different, refreshing and she doesn't succumb to his charms as every other girl. And most importantly, she turns his life upside-down. Now, Travis finally discovered a real challenge...I never judged Travis. Yes, he used to be a manwhore and pig but he never forced anyone to anything and he never ever had bad intentions. He is just angry young man, full of his personal turmoils. Being it Travis's head was unforgettable experience. Unfortunatelly, his thoughts were chaotical amd all over the place. I wished author paid more attention to storytelling and editing and tidied up the flow of the story to make reading more enjoyable experience for her readers.* I received ARC from NetGalley as an exchange for honest review *More reviews on my blogReading Is My Breathing
