Thomas comes to the maze in a box, he has no memories of anything other than his name. He learns that he is the "GreenBean" or the newest boy to arrive. They get arrivals once a month.There's a ton of questions about how he got there and why there is a maze that has walls that move every night.Then there are the Grievers. Which for the life of me I could not find scary. A machine-like slug? Pour some salt on that fucker.The next day a girl arrives.It throws the boys into an uproar. A GIRL! and never before has a newbie came through the box the day after another one. Then they realize she has a mysterious note.It's all about to change. I wish it would because I am dang confused. No complete answers are ever given in this book.So a sum up of the whole book could be this very gif:Will I move on in the series? Probably not, it's not the worst book ever but I hate not having answers so I'll just get pissed off if I continue.
