This book is the reason I haven't won a giveaway on here for over three years.*shakes fist* I never read it so I've never won another giveaway and now I probably will never win one again in the future.I won this from Goodreads in one of the first giveaways I entered, back in 2009, I believe. I think they gave away over 1000 copies of this book, or something around that? Since then I've realized that unless you read the books they send you you're probably not going to win another giveaway. Oh well, I have thousands of books to read.I wish I hadn't entered to win this book though, because even though it's pink, I really don't like chick-lit. It has pretty good reviews and I have friends who liked it so there was always a chance that even though it wasn't my favorite genre I might have found something about it to like. I was probably going to read this someday, mostly just because GR gave it to me to read, butnot anymore.So I've got this free book that I'llNEVER read, even though I was going to give it a fair shot. I don't expect this to count as "reviewing" this book just so I could maybe start winning giveaways, but that doesn't mean I still didn't have something to say.
