This was pretty disappointing. Lucy Maud spends WAY too much time describing unimportant incidentals, like when Anne spends a summer teaching in Valley Road (I had to Google the name of the town because I couldn't for the life of me remember it, so what's that tell you about how riveting the chapter was?). It had absolutely no relevance to the story and the only thing I recall about it was that the woman driving the cart was flat-out obnoxious. "Jog along, black mare!" Ugh, it's like fingernails on the chalkboard just remembering it. I'm all for using quaint colloquialisms, but L.M. abused them to the point of ridiculousness (see also - Davy with "I wanna know" and Paul with "YOU know, teacher"). The best part of the story was, once again, Anne and Gilbert's romance, but it was relegated to an afterthought. I'm really starting to question whether or not I want to finish the series.
