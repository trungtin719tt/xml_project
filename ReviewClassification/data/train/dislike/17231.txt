RIP OFF! This was without doubt a cheap ploy to fleece money out of Twilight fans by throwing together some utter drivel about characters you don't give a rats ass about. The only interesting character was Fred, and the rest were a waste of space. Bree is nothing like the way newborns are talked about in the Twilight Saga(magically of course she is more restrained than they are...uh huh...). The so-called love story never even starts and the end scenes where Bree faces the Cullens is piss poor, badly written and a total anti-climax. The so-called 'shock' in the book was so obvious that I was just shaking my head!Now I loved the Twilight books but this was pure rubbish and I certainly won't buy similar novellas in the shops again. I feel totally cheated and ripped off with this twaddle. Now I'm off over to readitswapit.co.uk to get something decent in its place!!!
