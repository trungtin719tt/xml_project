Last Sacrifice by Richelle Meadactual rating: 2.85/5 stars4th series finished so far this year, am I killing this reading challenge or what? ;)So, this is the final instalment in the Vampire Academy series, and I was a bit disappointed,I think I kind of fell out of love with this series afteror maybe even duringbook four. Maybe this is because I'd read soooo many books in between reading books three and four, that my tastes grew and my criticisms became tougher, in a way.However, I absolutely adored the first 3 books in the series, and they will always hold a special place for me. It is really sad that I personally found the series to lose its appeal as it went on.Last Sacrifice is a good book, but not a great book, or a particularly 'amazing' end to a series, which I was holding out hope for, but never truly expected I'd get after reading books 4 and 5. I found myself skimming through some slabs of text on some pages because they just weren't necessary, and I feel as if the last couple of books weren't written as well as the first few, sadly.For the huge amount of pages it has, it didn't feel like it went very far, or that very much actually happened. I think the ending was okay, pretty disappointing to be honest, nothing to completely blow me away. I was content with most aspects of the ending, however found the whole Lissa thing extremely predictable, though I am glad that happened.Bye, bye Vampire Academy, I'm so happy I've finished you, and I'm sorry our relationship turned a bit sour towards the end...Order from favourite to least favourite1. Frostbite2. Shadow Kiss3. Vampire Academy4. Blood Promise5. Last Sacrifice6. Spirit BoundI think this would be my order...If i'm remembering correctly
