way too sappy for me. i do like feel good books, but not sappy love stories. i just didn't buy that all their relationship issues were his fault. as a feminist i believe women are accountable for their happiness and if they aren't happy with their relationship they need to speak up/do something about it. i do believe that people can change and that theme in the book was good.
