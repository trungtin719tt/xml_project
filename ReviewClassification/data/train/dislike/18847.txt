I read this for The YA Room's Throwback Bingo Challenge!Challenge Square: FaeThere were lots of things about this book that either confused me, or didn't sit well with me personally. Each chapter is named after a type of phobia and for someone like myself who has an anxiety disorder and lots of fears, it was a little uncomfortable but that is just me personally. Zara lives with her grandmother after the death of step-father and things go well, until she feels that someone is stalking her. After some time, her past starts to catch up with her. I was really interested in the fae aspect, but when the introduction of werewolves happened 50% through, I was just very lost about who was who. I would say that this is more of a werewolf book rather than a fae book. I struggled with the writing style and couldn't connect to the characters. I won't be continuing on with the series!
