I'm being cynical, and I'm also a little angry, and I can't comment because I haven't read it... but I just want to say one thing to Stephenie Meyer. LET IT GO.Twilight is over. You can't keep pushing it for all it's worth anymore. You have to accept that eventually all good things come to an end and it's best to end this before you completely ruin it (although you did a pretty good job of ruining the whole series with Breaking Dawn). There comes a time when it's quite sad that you have to start writing fanfiction for your own novel.I'll read it but I doubt I'll be happy with it.Having said that, I wish that Stephenie would start on a new project. I would like to see something else from her that's not Twilight or The Host.
