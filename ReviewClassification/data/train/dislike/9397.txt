I hate The Polar Express.I don't so much dislike Chris Van Allsburg, although I consider him complicit. I think Bad Day at Riverbend is a top 5 picture book for me, and his art style is great, and he can often tell a fun story (last year's Probuditi a great example).But holy crap do I hate The Polar Express.It's like Love You Forever - tacky, sentimental pap designed to get you to shed a tear or tug on your heartstrings or whatever. The bell! The whole thing just...throws me. I don't get it.But the worst part? Kids eat it up! It's crazy. Some annoying trends I understand. Fairies and princesses are fun, the pony thing is weird, but okay, and I was a potty humor kid myself, but of all the things to catch on...But no, actually, that's not the worst part. The worst part is how it's being milked now. The movie (which was mediocre) was one thing, but the gift set with the sleigh bell? The crazy stuff people do? Gah!I really, really hate this book.
