2.5 stars !Jaidee fell on his knees and screamed"Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh!!!!!!!"How can a book that is written well with many excellent elements cause such dire frustration and become a hodgepodge mess????Ms. Macdonald is a very good writer with wonderful ideas that seem limitless but unfortunately she tried to fit them all in the span of one novel. There are a thousand stories in here and none get developed. She creates a number of interesting characters only to plaster them with more and more make-up and gaudier and gaudier costumes that take them from being flesh and blood to Vaudeville players.This book is like taking first rate ingredients and putting them all together in a stew without any thought to how they will taste together.She piles dysfunction on top of dysfunction on top of dysfunction so that something that is initially interesting becomes histrionic and then just plain tedious.I will try another novel of hers at some point and see if she has been able to direct her talent into something more cohesive, whole and ultimately satisfying.
