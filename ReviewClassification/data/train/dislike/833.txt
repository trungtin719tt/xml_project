2 StarsI know this is a much loved, much published, children's classic that has been published in pretty much every language there is. As such, I'm not pretentious enough to think my thoughts on it matter, so I'll keep this short.I have challenged myself to read one classic a month this year, and so far, I am failingmiserably. MISERABLY, you guys. It's July (almost August, but I'm throwing myself a bone so I feel like less of a loser) and I have only read two. This one andPeter Pan(of which I also completely missed the plot). And yes, I chose both of them because they are short. And geared for children. So I figured they would be easy to read.Wrong.I finishedAlice in Wonderlandon December 28th of 2017 (which I ALSO didn't love), after reading it over the course of almost a full month. If only I had really let my loser truly shine and work for me for once and waited three more days to finish it. Then I would at least be three for seven.But I digress.I'm starting to think children's classics might not be for me. At least not these whimsical, nonsensical, fable/allegory-style classics for which I am obviously too uncouth and unintelligent. Or whatever the case may be. Regardless, I am just finding them to be very boring and I just can't get into them.I'm gonna tryDorian Graynext though. NOT a children's classic. So hopefully I have more luck.Fingers crossed.
