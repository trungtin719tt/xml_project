What a disappointment. I had high hopes with this book. Anyway, though the author doesn't owe me anything, I did feel cheated of my hours invested in The Lovely Bones.Thematically, the book is a mess. The questions we have, both about events in heaven and on earth are left unanswered. I also found myself getting a bit depressed. I usually am like that whenever I read a bad book.But this time I got depressed because I was reading the Lovely Bones. Death is a pitiless side of our cognition, but the way it has been treated here is so underwhelming. Let's shake off this book and march on, shall we?
