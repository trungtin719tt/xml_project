This was my first Elif Safak and I can only hope that not all of her novels are like this. I simply found this novel weak, even "forced." It reads like any other Western/American novelist writing about the Eastern culture. But wait... Elif Safak is Turkish, right? Precisely.. I think what the author tries to do with this novel (and unfortunately fails) is to show a treasure of Eastern spiritualism to the American reader. What happens as a result is that it becomes another form of exoticism. There's something that doesn't quite fit with the language. Shams and Rumi speak American, and Aziz is definitely not Scottish. Has Safak's language become too American? She has written this work originally in English, so is she writing for a primarily American readership? Is she stuck between the liminality of the American and the Turkish? Whatever the source of the problem is, I'm afraid I found the story superficial, weak and cliched. It almost reads like fictionalised dummies guide to Rumi. She tries to create an original narrative structure with book-within-book, parallel narratives and multiple narrative voices, but it's all to simplistic and lacks literary finesse.I'm aware that this is a rather scathing review, but I'm highly disappointed with the novel. Still, before I give up on Safak, I'll make sure I'll read something else of her.
