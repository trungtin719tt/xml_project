COME ON? What's with the picture perfect reviews on this book?This book has nothing appealing to it. I don't know what it is about Nicholas Sparks but his books always give that sort of dull, sameish vibe to it. Apart from The Notebook, his other books are basically the same. This book is no exception. There is honestly nothing special. It's about this kid Ronnie who likes to party but is actually a smart girl who reads, get this, Anna Karenina. Still, she manages to screw herself over and hang out with the wrong crowd and then get framed for stealing. She's pissed off at the world but mostly, it's directed at her dad. Then she sees this hot guy (who is of course, your sterotypical hot guy searching for a girl who just 'gets him' yaknow?). Romance ensues.It doesn't help that I can't get freakin Miley Cyrus out of my head every time I'm picturing Ronnie. Her fish face in the movie really made me want to just pull my hair out. Good thing I didnt actually watch it in a theatre but rather illegally (see this is why movies are uploaded online). Nicholas Sparks tailored this book to Miley Cyrus which explains a lot about why I can't stand Ronnie (who is actually a lot smarter and sweeter than the actress who plays her).But this really has less to do with my dislike of Miley Cyrus and more with how these novels get really tiring to read, especially since so many teenage girls squeal about how AMAZING it is. No, it's not. Go read Wuthering Heights. Pride and Prejudice. Lord of the Rings. REAL FICTION. Not this crap.
