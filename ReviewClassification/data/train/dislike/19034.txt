After this book the series has lost its charm, I don't think I'll read any of the other books. This wasn't exactly a bad book... just kind of tedious. It takes place over 3 years and goes between Anne being at college and at Green Gables.The best part: Anne and Gilbert finally get together!The good part: It's fun to see Anne and her friends making a home out of Patty's place, even if her new friend Phil is extremely annoying.The bad part: Davy is still disturbing to read about. He cries because he missed the "fun" of seeing Mrs. Lynde fall down the cellar stairs and hurt herself. Anne is proposed to 6 times. She turns down pretty much every one of them, it gets a little silly.The worst part: The author is constantly inserting her views on god and politics into the story.The horrifying part: Anne and her friends find a stray cat and they decide to kill it by putting it into a box with chloroform. WTF. Even worse, Mr. Harrison decides he doesn't want his dog anymore so he hangs it. After it survives and tries to hide in the barn, he hangs it again. WTF. I know things were different back then but WTF!!! It's horrifying how calm they all are about murdering animals when they get so offended by statements like "God knows."
