Well, looks like my 14-year-old was right--it was as bad as I remembered. The concept was nice, but terrible execution and the plot got too muddled in the middle. Ittriesto be funny but fails. Epically.And Artemis struck as a wee sexist. He doesn't want to hurt a girl because she reminds him of his mother and his friend, Juliet. The author might be trying to show that Artemis is actually a nice guy, but the way I see it, there are only two options: Oedipus Complex or sexist jerk.It's gotta be one of them.If you want a fun middle-grade book with mythology elements, readPercy Jacksoninstead. At least you won't feel talked down to.
