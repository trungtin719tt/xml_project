A heartbreakingly spare story about the heat death of the universe. One by one the things of the world are bid adieu. Beginning with small losses--clocks, socks, a young mouse who will never reach adulthood, the stakes rise relentlessly until the loss of the atmosphere, stars, and sound itself. In the end the illustrated moon shines on, a reminder of things lost, but the protagonist--and the reader--are left sleeping in the dark.
