ok this sucks. boring. terrible writing. overly schmaltzy. i give up.i give up on barbara kingsolver.i LOVED "the poisonwood bible." one of my favorites.i abhorred "animal, vegetable, miracle." i am one of those people that HAS to finish every book i start, but I couldn't get past page 150. i was hoping that it was just her attempt at nonfiction that failed, but now i can't get page 150 of this either.i'm starting to think "the poisonwood bible" was a fluke.no more barbara for me. no more.2 stars because it's gotten such good reviews, and maybe i'm too dumb/lazy to find what it is. also, it would make a good lifetime movie.
