Yes, I said it. 2 very generous stars. Yep, yep.Firstly, I was perpetually laughing and snorting and cringing all while reading this book. Sanderson doesn't know how to write female characters who can both be intelligent and alluring. And, dear stormfather, if I never have to read the words"spren" or "storm-fucking-father", it would be too soon.As if there weren't enough facepalming moments, Dalinar (supposedly a 5-star General) goes to war knowing failure was inevitable yet by some 'Deux ex Machina' luck, Shallan manages to save the day.*Laughs maniacally*Also, why doesn't anyone die? Even Szeth (who was the only character that seemed mildly interesting) was resurrected.Lastly, and the most baffling, am I the only one who has an issue with Sanderson's portrayal of the Pershendi people?
