Here on Goodreads, rather than judging a book by its cover, it is always handier to judge a book based on what your friends and people you are following had to say about it after it had passed under their beady eyes.I have 91 friends here on Goodreads and follow 6 people and of the 12 friends and three people I'm following, only one (Kingfan30) wrote a review. Even the more loquacious members of the group have chosen to remain silent - Karen, Mike and PetraX - not a jot or a scribble (yet). I can see all the ratings but around the book itself there is a sphinx like silence. It is fair to say that the silence surrounding this book speaks volumes.I on the other hand, am loud and shouty and even though I did not finish this book or understand it in the slightest well, I am going to have my say.So here goes...What the hell happened there then?I have got no idea what happened.Can anyone explain what happened?Did John Fowles even know what was going on?Is everyone else confused?Good.This book is on the1001 Books to Read Before you Dielist. I am proposing they move it to the1001 Books to Confuse the Living Baby Cheesus out of you Before You Die and Even After You are Dead You Might Still be Wondering Exactly What The Hell That Was All Aboutlist.Principally the story of commitmentophobic Oxford graduate, Nicholas Urfe, who runs away from his girlfriend and gets a summer job teaching on a picturesque Greek Island. With the unwitting sixth sense that only the public school educated seem to possess (see The Secret History by Donna Tart) he immediately finds the seedy underbelly within the seemingly sunny and simple island living. Embraced in the dark clutches of the mysterious Maurice Conchis, possible Nazi/wizard/pedlar of hallucinogenic drugs/madman, Nicholas participates in a parade of obscene vignettes, masques and midnight alfresco romping. What does it all mean? Damned if I know! What happened in the end? Dunno. I gave up because I am a quitter but I am sure if I had carried on reading I'd have been none-the-wiser anyway.
