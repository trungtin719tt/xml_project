Okay, so it's been years since I read this book. I read it based on people telling me Nicholas Sparks was this amazing author. AND, I knew they had made a movie off of the book, and any time they do that, the book is always super good, right? TOTALLY WRONG! I remember it was one of the dumbest books ever. None of the storyline was very logical, and at the end, the main character dies, leaving you saying, "WHAT THE CRAPPITY CRAP?! HOW CAN YOU KILL OFF THE LOVER IN A LOVE STORY?" I suppose that was supposed to make it even more deep or something, but it just bugged me. I want a happily ever after, dang it! My eyeballs feel they wasted precious minutes of their life being forced to read this book. I had to apologize to them many times afterwards.
