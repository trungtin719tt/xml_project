"she was always dreaming and thinking odd things and could not herself remember any time when she had not been thinking things about grown-up people and the world they belonged to. She felt as if she had lived a long, long time."I wished Frances Hodgson Burnett stopped explaining about Sara at this point. Because at this point, I like her already. Because at this point, I wish I read this book when I was a child. Because at this point, I start to think that Sara and I have similarities.Sadly though, couple pages later turned my feelings to Sara 180 degrees. She is perfect. Far, far, far too perfect. Not as a child, as a human being. Whimsically pretty, kind, selfless, rich, adored, and different. Boringly perfect. Unlovable perfect.The kind of perfect that leaves me with a feeling:"okay, she got everything, everyone love her, life will turn perfect for her yadda yadda yadda. So why should I give a damn about her?"But of course, this is just temporary. I'm not even halfway reading it. Time will tell, hopefully.*shrugs*
