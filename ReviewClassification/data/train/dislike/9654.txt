Wow, what a total stinker. I read this as part of a book club, and I am sorry I wasted my time. This is a highly implausible story about some low life drug dealers and their family connections. The writing was disjointed and poor. "Angela's walks to the village to check on news of Steph were still a regular part of her week, but as time had gone by they had become less anxious events and now more routine". Time had gone by? Try "time went on". How many poor similes describing snow fall does one book need? The editing was very bad. (i.e. in one sentence a character's name is Joanna, in the next it's Joanne....) There were many instances within the story where one paragraph so poorly flowed into the next that the author should have begun a new chapter. The flow was simply off...poor or no transitions. There was not ONE redeeming character in the entire book. I didn't care who lived or died. And the cheesy ending! It was so unrealistic, and improbable as to be laughable. The sudden intense kiss after nearly dying? Give me a break. The main characters entire relationship made little sense. The author didn't bother to explain why Scott had feelings for Angela, other than being sexually attracted. Too many coincidences that were poorly explained. I just can't say anything nice about this story. Glad it's over with but annoyed I wasted the time to read it.
