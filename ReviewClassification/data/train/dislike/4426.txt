About 5 years ago when I first read this series, I powered through them and while I recognised they were problematic, I still consider them a guilty pleasure (the books are just so BAD and fun)1.5 stars are purely for how trashy/fun this book was.This was SUPER problematic though which made me cringe, a lot.It's homophobic (yes I know there's a gay character but the 'joke' at the beginning saying he isn't really a guy because of this is really really fucking bad), it has plenty of slut shaming, Zoey has issues with the word shit (she says POOPIE ffs) yet has no problem calling Aphrodite a slut every five seconds.Idk, it was fun but it's so so bad as well. I will be continuing my reread though as I can't remember much and I want to see how it all ends
