The problem with Sarah Dessen's books is not that she uses the same formula in every single one. That's fine! She's good at it, people like it - what one can do onemustdo, etc., etc.No, the problem is that she uses the same deadass doorknob of a female protagonist every single time. Auden is Annabel (Just Listen) is Ruby (Lock and Key) is Caitlin (Dreamland). They are ALL. Thesame.And my God, they are boring ashell.Auden, by far, is the deadest doorknob of them all. She is about as exciting as a laundry basket full of dirty clothes. She is actually paint. Drying on a wall. She is a soulless corpse. She isnothing.I amtiredof reading about these boring AF girls who everyone seems to find interesting and mysterious and unlike anyone else they've met. It's not real. You cannot just walk around without a personality and have people enjoy your company.The actual story doesn't really exist. At least not in the couple hundred pages I've read so far. Auden has terrible parents blah blah she feels pressured blah blah whatever. I'm asleep. The love interest this time around is also exceedingly dull and there is less than zero chemistry between them. The only common ground they share is their identities as outcasts (which they have GIVEN THEMSELVES FOR NO. REASON. PEOPLE LIKE THEM. PEOPLE WANT TO TALK TO THEM. THAT DOESN'T MAKE YOU AN OUTCAST) and theirinsomnia.SARAH, staying awake all night and sleeping through most of the day doesn't make you aninsomniac,it makes you nocturnal. Or a teenager. And it certainly doesn't make someone unique or intriguing. AUGH.I've been DNFing books left and right this year and I promised myself I would try not to do it again unless it was absolutely necessary but eff that. This is drivel and I'm over it.
