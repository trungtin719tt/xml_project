I shouldn't write a review for this, much less assign stars to it (which I might not do by the time I'm finished writing). My GR friendDolorshas said it already, and so eloquently, too (here'sDolor's review), especially in her penultimate paragraph, its last sentence reminding me ofItalo Calvino'sIf on a Winter's Night a Traveler, which I loved. None of the star rankings are applicable for me, though of course I recognize the work's brilliance and that it deserves 5 stars: I just don't think this book's for me.I felt a frisson now and again when I'd arrive at a particular story's ending or when I realized its point, but I guess it wasn't enough for me. I chuckled at times: I did find some humor. I don't mind stories that are claustrophobic or that reflect back upon themselves like an Escher painting or any of the other things that these stories do, but I think I need more of a middle (more reality? more story? more humanity? less analytic coldness?), no matter how elegant the structure might be.
