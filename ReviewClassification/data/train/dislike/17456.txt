Like wrapping a blood-drenched knife in cotton wool, this is a five star novella wrapped in a 2 star novel. There's just way too much unnecessary fluff.On re-read with the fine folk over at Horror Aficionados it has become clear to me that this is an extremely flawed book.The core of the story is the relationship between Oskar and Eli, everything else is secondary to that. Unfortunately, subplots relating to Tommy, Lacke, Virginia, Jocke, and especially Hakan litter the pages with distractingstuffthat is largely irrelevant to the main narrative.Half of the book could have been cut to produce a tightly written, pacey novella that carried all the scare, chills and horror implicit in the story.But, instead we got a bloated novel that spends pages and pages on irrelevant relationships and the mental drivel of a guilt-ridden child rapist and serial killer who doesn't have the courage toendhis problem once and for all.As for the core narrative, 5 stars for creating a character in Eli that transgresses so many boundaries at once as to be quite unforgettable, as for Oskar - he's mostly a prat.As for the narrative as a whole, this is a dark, and chilling book, and I'm left with the sneaking suspicion that Eli is simply replacing Hakan with Oskar, who will be the latest in a two-hundred year long line of stooges that he has bent to his will.Oskar, being the prat that he is, will welcome the iron servitude to a dark master wrapped in the velvet glove of acceptance and friendship.
