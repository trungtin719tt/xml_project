The Bean Treesby Barbara Kingsolver is the older twin of a book I read a year ago calledPigs in Heaven.As the first book of the duo, it chronicles the flight of Taylor Greer from a small, hick lifestyle to a freer life she didn't expect. Basically, Taylor's managed to be educated and not get pregnant when she finally takes her car across the country. But one night in a bar, a mysterious Indian woman gives her a young girl. Suddenly, Taylor finds that she's a single mother with no prospects. What's a girl to do?While writing that summary, I was struck by how interesting the narrative elements seemed. Young, single, white woman faces world with young child that needs love; they triumph. However, I was, to put it bluntly, unimpressed by the entire book. The same thing happened withPigs in Heaven.I liked the idea Kingsovler presented and I think she has brings real places into fiction, but I just was not impressed by the execution.Another complaint that I had aboutPigs in Heaven,which also holds for this book, is that there were moments that made me believe this novel wouldn't age well. Again, I can't remember any particular points, but certain sections would pop out at me while I was reading and make me think.... Hmmmmm....I know Barbara Kingsolver enjoys popularity among literary circles, but I'm really perplexed by it. Compared to the hundreds of other candidates who are more than qualified to be read in classrooms, why choose her?Oh yeah, there were bean trees, and they were a metaphor. But I never thought it worked.
