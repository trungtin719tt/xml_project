I was in the mood to read fluff, but is it too much to ask to read fluff that isn't filled with absurd stereotypes that make you cringe? The Mexican maid who steals the ring and lies about it? The valedictorian named Cho who is super smart but has no personality? The homophobia? The (I kid you not) bulbous nosed law firm lawyer who is greedy and awful? And many more? It's also the stupidest plot in the world. The dude is an asshole and so is the girl. I was rooting for both of them to not be assholes, but alas, they stayed assholes.
