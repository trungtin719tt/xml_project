(4/23/09) I saw a quote from this book on my friend Misha's profile last night and a flood of good feelings came rushing over me. While I don't remember the specifics of the story (other than the surprise ending!), I do remember reading it a hundred thousand times. I remember the golden spine, a different texture than the rest of the hard cover. I remember, that maybe, years later, the dog chewed the corner. And I remember loving this book a lot.Funny, as I think about it now, I wonder why I've lived such a fearful life. Doesn't this book teach us that sometimes our fears are blown way out of proportion? Or maybe it teaches us, that we, ourselves, are our own worst nightmares; thatIam the monster at the end of my own book. How scary is that...?
