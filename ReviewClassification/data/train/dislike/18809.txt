LOVED Outlander, Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager, but this book was *Simply Horrible*. Plodding, too much description of certain events that are of zero importance to the overall plot (usually medical), the rehash of old themes and introduction of new, just plain ridiculous ones made this almost painful to read. Thank goodness I took it out from the library and didn't waste my money or shelf space on it.Obviously I am quite disappointed in this latest installment of Jamie and Claire, because there is so little of interest happening between of these two. I agree with another reviewer that I couldn't remember who 80% of the plethora of characters in the book were (and she didn't refresh us), and adding a whole host more made it even muddier.. Add in the back and forth thing... no thanks.I think that the series started going downhill with the Revolutionary War, and I stand by that. Sadly, I don't think I'll be reading any more of them because it will further taint the magic that Outlander once was.
