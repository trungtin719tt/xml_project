I feel like I am the only person in the universe to not *get* this book. Perhaps I am not really human, but rather a troll or some other such hard-hearted creature.I suppose my main issue with this book is that I couldn't quite understand the world that Mr. Grahame created. Pithy words of wisdom on What It Means To Be A Child tell us that children don't have preconceptions and thus accept things more readily, being shaped only by the prejudices of adults. I assume most people would use that argument against what I am about to say, to wit, that this book makes no sense.The Wind in the Willowswobbles along the line between fantasy and realistic fable. On one hand, there are talking animals. On the other hand, there are humans, railroads, motor cars, and jails. Sometimes the animals just live their lives along the riverbank or in the woods, doing very animalish things like migrating and storing up food for the winter and so forth, and sometimes they steal motorcars and insult the police and get tossed in the clink for 20 years. That last one is Toad, by the way, whom I found to be absolutely insufferable. Also, somehow Toad has hair, which I don't understand at all. IS HE A TOAD OR A MAN??? Are humans and animals the same size in this universe? Toad somehow manages to sneak around disguised as a (human) washerwoman, but is manhandled as if he were toad-sized. My head hurts from all the contradictions.This is where everyone who read and loved this rushes in and shouts: "But it's fantasy! Where is your imagination? What's wrong with you?"Ahem. Are you done now? I mean, really, though. I read a lot of fantasy, and I'm quite prepared to suspend my disbelief (or belief) in order to go along with a story. I love the absurd. But I also like my stories to have continuity, and to make some sort of sense in the universe they inhabit. I honestly have no other words to express my befuddlement after finishing this.
