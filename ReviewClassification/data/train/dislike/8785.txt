I feel the need to insert a negative review from a believer of evolution and a harsh critic of organized religion. His basic assertion that faith and science are inextricably entangled is sound. However, he leaps off this logical diving board and into a mess of false simplifications about the nature of faith, the logic of science, and the lives of atheists vs. believers. If you want to figure out if evolution is real, read some biology books and take a walk outside. This trash is only for people who require a heightened sense of superiority as reward for being an atheist.
