The use of a large amount of symbols and conspiracy buzzwords does not excuse one from having to actually write a compelling story. The "twist" in this books was easily visible hundreds of pages out and didn't surprise a single person I know who read the book.Now, I had very high hopes for this book as I am from DC and love the area, however there was so little of actual DC in the book(unlike DaVinci Code &amp; Angels and Demons) that it seemed like it could have been in any city in the world except for what takes place in a few buildings. I enjoyed DaVinci Code as well as Angels and Demons so it's not that I don't like this style of book, but it seems almost as if this particular book has no real defined style. The entire book seems rushed and forced like the publishing company just told Mr. Brown that he had to write a new book, whether he had a good idea or not. Turns out... he did not.All in all, reading this book was like finding out that the girl of your dreams in high school... is now a man.
