Why the hell did I pick this book up? It was depressing as hell and it was poorly written. It chronicles the abuse this little boy named David went through as a child. And I think abuse is too mild a term for what he went through. It was horrible. Reading the torture he endured at the hand of his own family was painful.I came away from this book depressed. And I had several thoughts that kept running through my head. What was the point of this book? It almost seemed like a shrink told him to write out the horror of his childhood and then he turned around and sold it. There was no reflection on the events that happened so there was only horror. What is the point of that? The only thing I could think of was to expose to the world that such treatment did happen to someone at some point in the recent past.I guess that is the crux of my disappointment here was that so much could have been done with this book. It had the potential to be educational or thoughtful and instead it was just a car crash from cover to cover.
