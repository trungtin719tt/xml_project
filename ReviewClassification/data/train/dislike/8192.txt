I thoroughly enjoyed Wells' first book,Little Altars Everywhere(which was a gift, fittingly, from myverynorthern sister-in-law. So I was dismayed to read this book and find that Wells had basically rehashed the stories fromLittle Altarsand dismally lessened their effect. Even more depressingly,thisbook got all the book club attention whileLittle Altarslanguished. Bleah.
