Positives: interesting idea (the world has five dominions which are split apart). Genderfluid character (with love interest). Gay couples (most significantly, Taylor and Clem).Negatives: the execution. I was definitely not into the sexual slavery ((view spoiler)[Judith is tied to the Goldophin family(hide spoiler)]) and rape ((view spoiler)[Gentle gets drunk when he creates Judith and has sex with her body. Perhaps he believes that she hasn't obtained consciousness yet? Also, Taylor gives Gentle a blowjob when Gentle is high and this is not considered impaired consent(hide spoiler)]). It also felt that there was gratuitous sex (you could probably skip most of the sex scenes without losing anything). The pace was bloated - there's worldbuilding, sure, but there's perhaps too much detail.We start with Estabrook being estranged from his wife, Judith. He had seduced Judith away from Gentle, a womaniser. Estabrook therefore hires an assassin, Pie, to kill Judith. This kicks off a series of events where we learn that(view spoiler)[Estabrook is the oldest son of the Goldophin family, where Judith is bound to. Gentle created Judith and cloned himself in that same night. Gentle eventually gets married to Pie, whose gender is determined by the person who views it. Also, Gentle and Judith don't remember their past(hide spoiler)]. This is all in the first book.To be honest, it feels quite clear by the middle of the first book that the book is nudging the pieces into place for(view spoiler)[the Reconciliation to take place;(hide spoiler)]but first, we have to follow the characters as they slowly discover ((view spoiler)[or in the case of Judith and Gentle, remember(hide spoiler)]) what happened during the last attempted Reconciliation and other events like what happened with the Goddesses.It's an extremely painful book to get through; I will grant that it is original, but the pacing really really sucks.1.5 stars (0.5 stars for originality)
