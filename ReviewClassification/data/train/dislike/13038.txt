Like many others, I wanted to read Mary Poppins prior to watching Saving Mr. Banks so that I could see what PL Travers arguments would be about Walt Disney changing her work. I have to say that I am glad that Disney changed it! In the story, Mary Poppins was not a likeable character to me. I just wanted to get through the story to see if she would change any from the vain and frankly, mean, woman that she started out to be. She did not. Usually, I like books better than the movie adaptations, in this case, the movie was a major improvement.
