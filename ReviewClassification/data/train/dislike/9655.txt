I was really looking forward to reading this book given the blurb on the back. Unfortunately, I just didn't find it that good. I found the writing really simplistic ( to be fair I had just finished The Secret History by Donna Tart, and picked this up straight after and it read like a child's book). The blurb on the back is misleading. The detective features for about 4 pages in the book, the ending is not 'apocalyptic' and all a bit rushed (it all concluded very quickly in about 3 pages) and I find it really patronising to the reader when all the loose ends have to be tied up so neatly. It was also utterly unbelievable.....and yes I do realise this is a work of fiction but really....a detective shooting and killing someone with no word of warning, a man seemingly unbothered with the killing of his brother etc. It all felt a bit rushed, under developed and lacking any real substance which is a shame as the initial premise was good.
