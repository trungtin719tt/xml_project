2.5 starsHmmm. At first, I really thought this was going to be at least a 4 star book. It wasinterestingand full ofdetail!Then suddenly, itwasn't.Wasn't interesting, that is. Oh, it wasstillfull of detail, don't worry.Details about how theyappreciatively sniffed wine.Details about different kinds oftea.Details about thelayoutsof old buildings.Details aboutrugsandfurniture.And just when I started to think I couldn't take it anymore...MORE WINE AND TEA!Yes, yes! Igetit! She likestea! He likeswine! After 400 pages I don't give a shit what it smelled like! Enough already!*deep breath*Toward the end, the story picked up a bit and started moving forward again. But it was too little, too late. Wait. Let me rephrase that, it was toomuch, too late. Suddenly there were huge info dumps, which would have been great had they been spaced out over the entire book. Everything thatshouldhave been happening/discovered/talked about in the middle of the book ('cause it was tea time!) was crunched into the last part of the story.It looks like this is a trilogy, but I seriously doubt I'm going to attempt to read any more of these. It looks like the author did a lot of research to bring this book to life, but it just wasn't for me.I'd recommend this to someone who enjoys slow-paced books with a lot of attention todetail.
