I tried really hard, but wow this book was boring. I think it reminded me way too much ofThe Historian, which was the biggest waste of 900+ pages I've ever read. I think it's because I've done way too much academic research in my 20 years of schooling to ever find it remotely entertaining.I think the part where the witches, vampires, demons, etc. do yoga together pretty much killed it for me.(Okay, it's probably more of a calm indifference, but had I wasted any more time this would be more fitting.)
