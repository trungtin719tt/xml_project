This book would have been great IF:1) the characters had some personality2) the main character - Thomas - weren't such a Gary Stu and showed some character development and growth instead of conveniently "remembering" important information to advance the plot3) the book weren't filled with atrocious made-up slang - "shuck-face," really, is this supposed to be cool?4) the villains - Grievers - were actually scary or dangerous5) the maze had some kind of mystery about it and not limited to moving walls and un-threatening prickly Grievers6) the plot weren't based on constant withholding of information by everyone and releasing it 200 pages later than it should have been7) the smartest of the smartest kids actually did something smart and uncovered some mysteries of the maze during the 2 years spent there8) the death of main characters evoked any feeling in readers9) the book weren't so slow-moving (thanks to constant withholding of info) and BORING!In the present form "The Maze Runner" deserves nothing more than an OK rating for moderately interesting premise. The hype and comparisons to "The Hunger Games" are unwarranted.
