Oy vie! What a horrible book. I decided to change it's title to "Beautiful and Vapid Hormones" Melissa Marr held so much promise for a feisty female protagonist, willing to fight the allure of immortal beauty and power for our mundane yet necessary mortality. Sadly, Aislinn (the main character) faded into nothingness in the last few chapters. It seemed as though Marr couldn't sacrifice either of the two worlds for her Aislinn and so gave her both, which in my opinion, gives her nothing. Life demands sacrifice for true happiness. Hormones ruled, not love or the quest for right, just penises and breasts, sorry to be so blunt, but it's too true. I'm thoroughly disappointed. Perhaps if the story started the way it began I wouldn't be so upset. But Marr set a beautiful stage, perfect characters with bright promises of illuminating lives. It's as if Marr put all her energy and wit into the first act. It was perfectly coordinated, hopeful lives waiting for tough decisions to show their true beauty and strength. The happy ending never came because as the curtain ascended to reveal the last act the actors, once graceful and awe-inspiring, crashed into each other, tripped, pulled down the beautiful set, ripped their glittering costumes, shouted profanities and uncovered their base savage hormones. I hope Ms. Marr becomes a great author she has it in her, but she needs to learn, as we all do, that life is lived beyond physical desire, in what we sacrifice for others and ourselves to gain wisdom and love.
