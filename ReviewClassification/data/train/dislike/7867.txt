LifelessThe overwhelming feeling after finishing this book is a sense of relief and then puzzlement that I did commit so much time to completing the task.I found the book "Jonathan Strange and Mr Norrell" a great disappointment on various levels and I may have been tempted to consider higher rating if it had not been so long. So that was my first and main disappointment - you took away hours that I could have spent on some great books. For once I have to say that the TV production was so much better than the novel.With any book, you want interesting characters, great portrayal of the environment, an enthralling pacey plot and an engaging writing style. The characters, for the length of the book, are quite bizarrely very one dimensional and the surrounding characters I had absolutely no empathy with. The environment was okay and I did feel that the atmosphere of the early 19th century England came through but nothing spectacular. The plot is so weak that the involvement with the Napoleonic Wars didn't even generate much interest. It was all very flat. If there had been a severe editing job done we may have had a pacier story and about half the length.I am surprised that it has received the plaudits that it has and I can only assume that the context of the story was a big draw. We all want to believe that magic exists and that somewhere a magician is just waiting to develop the skills handed down from Merlin. If that was to happen I can only hope that it's NOT to someone like Strange or Norrell and that there would be a wonderful plot of twists and surprises, with captivating characters to bring it all to life.Maybe that's the frustration it could have been a great story, half the length and a fantasy to remember.
