A Book not worthy of a reread, and most certainly did not belong on my Contemporary Literature reading list. Unfortunately, it was assigned, and I found myself tortured to have to pick it up again and again.Our main protagonist is Jake Brigance, a puke-bucket of a character who I found hating and hating the more I read the book. He acts out at everyone, is often rude, and is an over all narcissist - And this is supposed to be our "Hero".John Grisham is very transparent with his characters, making the "good-guys" attractive, and the obnoxious people fat, awkward, or old. We get a sense that the author wants to make certain people unlikable, like Jake's secretary Ethel, but he fails to give them any unlikeable attributes, except being old, awkward, or fat.My other gripe is that the only "strong" female character in the book is a perfect-in-every-way sub-human creature that, I am convinced, John Grisham probably created in a wet dream. That's right, Ellen Roark, who is wondrously obedient to her boss and stays in the shadows during trial because being a female is a no-no.This book is a Night Stand read, but nothing more.Tonya actually had it pretty good. Sure, she went through a lot with the rape, but at least she didn't have to read this book!
