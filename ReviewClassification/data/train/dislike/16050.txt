I read all three of these books in a day apiece. They're badly written, ludicrous candy. Seriously, rich NYC socialite vampires? Who are also ANGELS? And models, apparently? And are almost 100% undeveloped as characters?Don't get me started on how "Croatan" actually refers to one of the native American tribes in the barrier islands of NC, and was probably meant to serve as a direction for the rest of the Roanaoke colonists when they came back from England. I mean, yes, the whole subject of the Roanoake colony's disappearance is a fascinating mystery, but there is no way "Croatan" meant "super-vampires are hunting the regular vampires in the original colonies help help!"
