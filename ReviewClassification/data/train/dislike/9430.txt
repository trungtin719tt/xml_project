Max Lucado seriously knows how to touch someone's heart with his books.I went to a sale today and they had a bunch of books. They especially had a lot of Max Lucado books which of course I grabbed up and this was one of them.This book, even though it is for children is really uplifting!Is about a Wemmick who learns that even though he is not like the others he is special in his own way.His writing always touches your heart!This is perfect for any age!
