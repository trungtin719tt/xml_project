Buddy Read with mybrotha from anotha motha.The only good part about this book was reading it with a friend. I honestly can't write a review because I have no fucking clue what happened, to whom it happened to, nor what dimension I was in when it occurred.I'm thinking that in about 10 years when my brain has recovered I would like to pick up a physical copy of the book and give it a better try.I love audiobooks and especially ones that are long- Stephen King's It is over 44 hours and I've listened to it several times! But for some reason, this one was just a bit out of my reach. I have not sworn Barker off for this, as I am sure a second reading would help, but I think I am going to be a while before I pick up another book of his.Thanks to one of my favorite people in the world for reading this with me! :D
