oh dear. this book was pushing me to the edge of self destruction. The book is just too..shallow for me to be interested in it. The plot is weak. Wait. is there even a plot in the first place? it is so bad that i am cannot even be bothered to give a full blown review. Too much conversation involving other people(Auden is like a invisible ghost some times. seriously? how does she overhear everything?). is it only me or...? judging from the ratings by other goodreads reviewers, i guess it is only me. I do not. I repeat. i do not want to know how a perfect pair of jeans will speak to you. Honestly. i am from singapore and the idea of summer is foreign here. We do get holidays here, but judging by the way the summer is described in Along for the Ride, you would think the characters in the book honestly have no purpose in life. they do the samething thing over and over EVERYDAY?? okay, i am getting too emotional. i should leave. but i can't. How many times does Auden and that Eli guy bring up the "talking to a girl's ex-boyfriend in her own kitchen" joke. how many times have i read the line "i did not know how to reply to that". Seriously, the whole purpose of this book is just lost on me. It is about second chances? hell yeah it is. of course it is about second chances if that word keeps popping up on every single page for the last part of the book!!!! for my own well being, i shall stop here. i apologise for the haywire review.And yes.UNFORTUNATELY.. i own a copy of this book. what a waste of space.
