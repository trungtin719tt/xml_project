Wow. Before anyone comments, I was a HUGE fan of the first book. Second book I thought was alright. This book sucked so bad. Between the terrible writing and the grammar and the fact that it was 800 pages of how long Paolini can babble about nothing and still keep an following.The reason for the 4th book was this was for character development? What character development, the characters are more one sided then ever. You can almost predict what they will do before they do it because they are just that lame.As for plot, it was just a bunch of go here go here. And then Eragon babbling in his mind about what will happen, could happen, might have, must happen.I really wanted this to go somewhere, sadly it didn't. A waste of time, energy and really money.I have to say this, Eragon is the poorest choice for a dragon rider. He can't make a choice for himself and he has no spine to stand up to anyone, so he just does what everyone wants him to.It's a shame that the king who might be a good character is only refered to throughout the book. Maybe he can be the redeeming character in the 4th book.There are so many sentances that start with "And" "Then" and "But" that they appear on every page in the book. That's just poor writing. It felt like a 3 year old telling me a story that they are excited about. Was there even an editor on this book? Or were they afraid that his teen ego would be hurt by the fact that obviously he never took English lessons in middle school or high school. That's the only thing I can think of, is that someone teaching him forgot to teach him grammar!Lastly, remember you can write a 3000 page book and it could suck or you can write a 150 page book people liked. Maybe Paolini should remember that because these marathon books he isn't very good at and is definately not learning any respect from me.
