My Rating: 2.4/5This could have been better. I am huge fan of the Bourne movies but this one is not what I expected!There are chapters that are fantastic but overall the novel is dull. The author spends two much time in explaining Bourne's thought process that you just want to scream. The characters are also not that interesting. I expected more but....I don't really recommend this one. Thank you for reading the review!P.S: I couldn't even finish the whole book. I read like half of it.
