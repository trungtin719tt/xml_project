Ah, now I remember why I loved Robbins and why I stopped. My first year of college ended in 1983, and one of my new roommates that summer introduced me to the writing of Tom Robbins (Thank you, Kendra!) Such daring, such freedom: you can do whatever you want and screw The Man. Here was this guy telling me how to do anything I wanted and have fun, have a laugh even. The Vonnegut -loving portion of my brain lit up in recognition. Heady stuff. Happy revolution. This is one of the things we go to college for, right?Skinny Legs and All came out in 1990. By then I had read books on feminismby women. By then I had had more than fifteen years of being constantly judged for attractiveness and congeniality without having to actually enter a beauty pageant, although I never had a shot at a scholarship either. I'd had more than fifteen years of bosses, acquaintances, and random strangers sexually harassing me at school and at work. I would be 27 before I held a job that didn't include harassment from co-workers or customers. By 1990 I had very little interest in a man telling me how to be all free and sexy. By the time I met Robbins I was right over that shit. Not that I remember him in particular: I spent a year opening books for authors at book signings, and there were a number I never read again for being awful people to the help.#MeToo
