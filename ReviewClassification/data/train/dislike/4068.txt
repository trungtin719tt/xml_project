Another baaad Artie Miller metaphor. It doesnt take alot of deep-think to explain Why. Folklore-friendly Millersloppily sees the hysterical McCarthy Era of the 50s as a parallel to the Salem witch hunts of the 17thC. Aye, here's the rub : We know that "witches" do not exist. We know that Communistsdidexist, worked in US government. Were Russ spies. So, any matchup w Salem is cockeyed mellercuckoo. Does this understanding require intelligence?
