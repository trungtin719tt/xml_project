I bought the CD of this story for my 4 year old daughter and have spent many days listening to it in the car with her.This book should clearly be renamed "Pa's follies" as the entire story is about him bumbling from one misadventure to the next....1. Pa leads the family across a frozen lake Peppin. The very next morning the family hears the ice on the lake start to crack and break up. By the luck of one day the Ingalls family is spared a frozen death.2. Pa nearly drowns the entire family crossing a creek into the Indian country.3. Pa nearly shoots good dog Jack thinking he is wolf after Jack manages to survive Pa's ineptness at crossing the creek.4. Pa drops a log on Ma while building their house nearly breaking her leg.6. While scouting out the new homesite, Pa bumbles into a pack of 50 wolves without his gun.7. The chimney pa builds soon catches on fire.8. Mr. Scott nearly dies while helping to build the Ingalls well when Pa doesn't check for gas.9. It turns out the new home is built near a malarial swamp which soon leads to the whole family getting fever and ague.10. The Indians, who Pa maintains are peaceful, keep harassing Ma and the girls when he is away and stealing their food.11. The Indians, who Pa maintains are peaceful, come withing a hair of deciding to slaughter all of the white settlers.12. After all of the family's blood, sweat and tears the government forces them to leave Indian country making the entire adventure a complete waste of time.His name should be Charles In-galling Incompetence
