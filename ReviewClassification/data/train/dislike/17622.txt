I cannot recommend this book. I actually threw it away after finishing it.This tells you a few things. 1) The writing was so good and compelling and addicting it made it difficult for me to stop reading, despite my issues with it. 2) I didn't want anyone else to read it, so I didn't give it away or sell it. How's that for hypocritical and childish?There were some sexual images, specifically incest, that I could not shake from my brain for several days. I kept replaying the scenes over and over and over again. It really bothered me.I don't like artsy descriptions of horrible perversion.One part of this book that I LOVED was in a marital-infidelity situation. The husband was systematically, purposefully seduced by a rather messed-up younger woman. He was a good man, a good father, and found himself in a very bad situation. Afterwards, he ran straight to his wife and told her. He was repentent, miserable. She instantly forgave him. She knew it would never happen again. And it didn't.It was a very cool concept that their marriage, their family was bigger than a moment of weakness. What he did was horrible. But to her, it wasn't horrible enough to lose what they had. I really admired this idea. It's not how we look at marriage very much today and it was refreshing.I enjoyed her writing style, obviously I was sucked in enough to read through it, but my heart was really dark and cloudy for a few days after reading it.Won't touch it again.
