A review on the back of my copy reads:Jeannette Walls has a story to tell, and tells it brilliantly, without an ounce of pity.No pity? Yep. You've got that right.No pity and NO EMOTIONS whatsoever. And certainly no humor.Ms. Walls tells her story like a journalist, which of course,she is, but it didn't work for me that she wasn't sharing her story, but reporting the facts.I felt cheated and unsafe throughout this entire read, as though Ms. Walls was allowed to be robotic and detached, but I was supposed to be delighted by the love she tried to sell as the basis of this memoir.The family that betrays together stays together?Love? Like the love her father expressed as he tried to sell her young body to a stranger? Like the love her mother conveyed by allowing them to live in filth, be homeless, be neglected, hungry, unclothed and so on? These parents were the most loathsome narcissists I've ever had the misfortune to meet.I needed Jeannette Walls to crack me up at the absurdity of it all (David Sedaris style) or BURN THE DAMN HOUSE DOWN TO THE GROUND. Here's the match, Jeannette, take it from my hand.This glass castle, built on garbage, was a garbage read for me, despite placing me in an incredible minority by declaring so.This was a book that celebrated impotence, enabling and neglect and there was no catharsis here, no retribution, either.I was as angry as theCount of Monte Cristoby the end of this read.I demand my revenge!
