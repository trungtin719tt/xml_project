Anne of Avonlea drinking game:Take a drink of your tea/soda/plum wine every time-Anne's grey eyes are mentioned-Marilla is sarcastic-Paul Irving says "youknow"-Paul Iriving refers to his "little mother"-Diana's weight is mentioned-Anne or Marilla express their preference for Davy/speak unkindly of Dora because she's "too good."The character of Davy just about ruined this book for me. I kind of hated him. His sister, Dora, is a sweet, mild-mannered, overall good kid. And so Davy takes great joy in tormenting her endlessly. But Anne and Marilla just write this off as him being "mischievous," never taking into consideration how awful this must be for Dora.Davy even locks his sister alone in the dark in a neighbor's barn, just because he thinks it would be funny to make everyone worry(!?). When Dora is finally found, she's been crying for hours. The end result of this episode? Anne and Marilla say they love Davy more because he needs them more. No, Doraneedsthem to protect her - from her brother. And they utterly fail.Anne's "scrapes" in the first book were because she often acted before thinking, or had a quick temper. But Davy's actions are thought out and deliberate, and he does them because he likes making trouble, making his sister cry, and getting a reaction out of people. Very, very different, imo.In addition, this book felt a lot more sickly-sweet and moralized more. It wasn't nearly as good as the first (isn't that always the way?), and I don't think I'll continue on with the series, even though I did want to see Anne and Gilbert get together.
