Evidence of this book's similarities to Twilight:1. New girl at school2. Mary Sue3. Girl attracts the hottest guys even though she has no personality or depth or anything remotely interesting about her4. Guy is extremely mysterious (because he stands at a corner and glares at everyone passing by) rude, and tells the girl to stay away from him5. Guy follows her around, and the girl isn't fazed whatsoever6. Guy is 100-and-something-years-old and girl is 17I don't understand. What is it with YA paranormal romance writers and making their characters complete dimwits with no depth. I'm tired of these dull, boring, weak, characterless girls. It's a damn shame I've had such shitty experiences with YA books in my life. It makes me want to give up on the YA romance genre for good.
