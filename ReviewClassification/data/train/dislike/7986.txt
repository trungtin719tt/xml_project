Though technically better written than Digital Fortress, this is Dan Brown's worst novel. Brown creates false suspense by hiding revelations from readers even after major characters learn them. In most cases this is unnecessary, as the twists would have more impact if made in a timely manner. Too often, however, the revelations are obvious or anticlimactic, weaknesses that are amplified by Brown's hide-the-ball technique.Brown's penchant for dubious subject matter is well-known, but he previously managed to pull out decent stories from hokum like the Illuminati and the holy blood/holy grail theory. Here he sidesteps the expected Masonic conspiracy theories, instead casting Robert Langdon as Mason apologist. No, Brown's meat here is Noetic Science, a field that in real life has the credibility of a cable TV huckster/mystic. Even after the plot wraps, Brown drones on for several more chapters about mysticism and religion, with no apparent purpose but to lecture you, dear reader, for having the gall to trust science and technology.As for Brown's style, phrases like "soggy marsh" make it clear he still hasn't picked up a copy of The Elements of Style.Much like Brown's villain, I need a cleansing ritual of my own after reading this book.
