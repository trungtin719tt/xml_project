What started out with so much potential in Clan of the Cave Bear, begins to rapidly fall apart in The Valley of Horses. By the time the 4th and 5th books of the series are reached, it's really best to just avoid reading them at all, and try to remember the better moments. Seriously, they aren't even worth reviewing, if only because Goodreads doesn't offer a negative star option.But here, Ayla still retains some of the qualities of her childhood self. This is set just after her banishment from the Clan, the only home and family she has ever known. She has had to leave everything, including her own son, after being cursed with death. But instead of dying, for Ayla is not the type to die, even if she isn't always the chipper, positive, up-and-at-em type, Ayla begins to head north in search of her own kind, her fellow homo sapiens.She eventually comes to a valley, with a conveniently located and sized cave. She is smart and innovative and lucky, and over the three years she spends there, she comes up with crazy new ideas (like where babies really come from), develops the art of breaking a horse, and learns that you can start fire by striking two particular stones together. It is in this novel, of course, that her inventiveness begins to become absurd and tedious. By the time one reaches the fifth book (which again, I do not recommend they try), one is ready to throw it out the window, for Ayla has figured out exactly how the world works, even though her fellow humans have not, and has invented five million new things, and is the model for about half of the pre-historic art that has ever been discovered.Still, the second book hasn't reached such a level of absurdity, and it's almost believable (until Baby comes along -- I had forgotten that, and cried out, "A cave lion??? Seriously?!?) The scenes describing her with her animals, who are her only companions, seem realistic and charming, and Auel continues to describe the prehistoric world is vivid details.Of course, there's still the other side of the book, where Jondalar, one of the most handsome of homo sapiens to walk the face of the earth, and his brother travel across the continent on a Journey. Their travels are unfortunately brought to life in all their dull details. There is something about these humans that Auel just can't pull off, and I can't put my finger on. But I found them almost in their entirety to be annoying, fake, two-dimensional, and useless. There is also a heavy interest in sex throughout their travels and their homo sapien culture, which comes off as Auel's overwhelming desire to write smut. The forth book, Plains of Passage, is so smut-ridden, I refer to it as Plains of Passion. Books 3-5, and part of book 2, read like fanfiction written by a horny teenager.Eventually, Jondalar and Ayla meet, Jondalar teaches Ayla how to talk, and Ayla teaches him the fifteen new advances to the race she has discovered in the last three years. They misunderstand each other in the most tedious and ridiculous ways, but finally admit that they lust for one another, and then the poor reader has to start enduring the many page long sex scenes that will haunt the series to its end.Not recommended except to those who truly loved the first book of the series.
