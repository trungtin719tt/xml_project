If you've ever picked up a self-help book where the author is repeatedly stating the obvious, then you've experienced the writing style of this book. The overall concepts could've been summarized in a short essay rather than a book. Its length is a testament to its antiquity, though the author has done a noble job of re-ordering and editing bits of the chapters to provide continuity and to delete repetition.Oriental philosophy is often ripe with a kind of double-speak and this book is no exception.The main idea, covered ad nauseam, are that generals must be wise, adapt to changing situations, and maintain order.What people get out of this book is whatever they want to read into it. It was an alright read but, in general, the book is overrated.
