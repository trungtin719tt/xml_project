An interesting novel but I find it pale in comparison with real prison literature, I'd recommend Evgenia Ginzburg's memoirJourney into the Whirlwindabove this without hesitation, not on account of literary merit but simply because of the author's sense of surprise at the unlikeliness of it all. Koestler's fiction is a work of the imagination. Something designed to serve the purposes of the author, that gives insight into their opinions and not into (save perhaps accidentally) the situation they are describing. It is I suppose in that way more akin to1984in its insights into the mind of somebody inside a totalitarian system than memoirs written inside the Soviet Union.It was written in 1940, perhaps the way to think about it is the search of an intellectual outside the Soviet Union to understand the treason trials and the shocking confessions of old Bolsheviks and trying to make sense of that and explain it in fictional form to the reading public. The date is interesting. Within a year Stalin was due to become the great friend and ally of the Western powers. The show trials and executions that the hero of the story is caught up in occurred some years earlier.Koestler was Hungarian and had experience of living under the Right-Wing regime of Admiral Horthy (Hungary doesn't have a sea coast, Horthy kept the rank as a souvenir from his days in the service of the Austro-Hungarian empire before the First World War, technologically he ruled Hungary as regent on behalf of the Emperor Charles, but on both occasions when Charles turned up in Hungary Horthy persuaded him that the time wasn't right for him to assume the throne and sent him back into exile again).Whether Koestler ever had any contacts with any Bolsheviks, old or young is questionable, along withArrival and DepartureandThe Gladiatorsthis book is part of an exploration of the (extreme or normal by 30s standards?) politics of the 1920s and 30s much of which must have seemed absurd and incomprehensible to outside observers - something which we see in the figure of the old professor inDarkness at Noon, either pretending to himself or driven mad with the cognitive dissonance, still holding to the idea of the Soviet Union as a promised land.It is the response of someone whose faith has been shaken searching for meaning in their world. It is Doestoevsky's story of the Grand Inquisitor fromThe Brothers Karamazovadapted and applied to a contemporary situation in an attempt to make comprehensible alien states of mind and foreign political situations.
