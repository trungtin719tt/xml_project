!!!First line is a spoiler!!!(view spoiler)[What part of having sex with a teacher is right?(hide spoiler)]Not that that is a big surprise *rolls eyes*Zoey is a Mary Sue. She is. How many guys are after her? I have lost count. Whatever she does she is always forgiven and hardly gets hurt. Everyone wants to be Zoey's boyfriend or friend because she is sooooo popular and everyone can relate to her. The only character I liked was Neferet and even then she's useless at destroying Zoey. To think that teens actually talk like that is beyond me.The twins - omg I assure you you'll want to slap them. How annoying?Take a look at the popular girl in your school, how many guys are after her? Two, maybe three, but that's about it. Nothing compared to Zoey and her dazzling charm and looks *throws up* ugh.Type into Google search bar "Zoey Redbird" and it even lists options such as...Mary Sue.The whole idea is AMAZING, seriously I think the idea is great. The first book , Marked, was okay but then it rattled down greatly with each book.
