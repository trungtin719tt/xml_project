I swore to myself that the last House of Night book would be my last. I just couldn't take Zoey and her multiple annoying boyfriends and her just as annoying friends. When Burned came out, I figure "what the hell, it looks relatively Zoey relationship free" Well, yes it was relatively that, but I guess BFF Stevie Rae just had to step up and fill Zoey's vacant shoes and have the boyfriend issue, but not with boys, but with a boy and a bird. Sorry, half bird, half man - whatever, he has a friggin beak, he's a bird. But of course there's some hot indian boy hiding in him that I'm sure Nix will turn him into in the next book or 2 so Stevie Rae can also have a hot boy. They all have hot boys, can't leave her out. Can't be a part of House of Night without a hot boy. Can you tell I'm sick of this story and now declare that "I WILL NOT READ ANOTHER OF THESE STORIES, SO HELP ME GODDESS!" This book was NOT for me - this series was NOT for me, yet i suffered myself through it as far as i could go. My disclaimer as always, it might not have been for me, but it could be for you - read it and find out, if you can stomach it.
