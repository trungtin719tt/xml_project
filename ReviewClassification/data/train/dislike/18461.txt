Oh god, what did I just read? Seriosuly, this looked like a really good book but then Kylie had to open her mouth and ruin everything. This book has a good plot but characters are so dumb I barely could tolerate it. Not just Kylie, it's all of them: Miranda, Della, Derek, even Lucas. They all are so immature and shallow. It was really hard bonding with them. Truth be told, I only liked Daniel the Ghost.Issues I had with Kylie: her immaturity, the fact that she couldn't get over her ex-boyfriend and fell in love with a guy who reminded her of him (what kind of messed up kid does that?!), how she couldn't stop claiming that she's just a human, how she pinned everyone in camp as freaks, and how she solved every situation in a second after someone gave her the right clues... I mean, really, you couldn't think of that before?!Guys are just there so she can pin over them. And I can't believe that she was afraid of Lucas because he supposedly killed her cat when they were kids! What, that makes him a serial killer now?! I know a bunch of kids who killed cats in their childhood but they're still decent human beings.I'm not even going to start on Miranda. Does that girl ever think of anything else except boys?!I'm not going to continue with this series. As much as I liked her ghosts (not how she was ignorant towards them) and am curious what will happen with Lucas (totally on his team!) I just can't cope with her attitude. Sorry, C.C. Hunter, this is just not for me...
