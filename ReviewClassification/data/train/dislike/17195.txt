Um. When did totally unrealistic and unbelievable and STUPID plot twists become acceptable? This book was a best seller. HOW CAN SUCH IDIOTIC THINGS MAKE THE BEST SELLER LIST?I know, I know. I read it too. But in my defense, the first two books were at least bearable in terms of plot.If I'm really honest, they weren't that wonderful, but I was caught by Max and Fang's little romance. And Max's attitude is so fun to read.But this book took it too far.Don't be surprised though when I tell you that I read book four. (who's idiotic now?)
