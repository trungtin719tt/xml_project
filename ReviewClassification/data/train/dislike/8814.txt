Read as part ofThe Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.I felt about Brideshead Revisited much the same as I did about The Great Gatsby. The writing was rather superb, but good writing does not mean that the characters are likeable or the plot is anything substantial. I really didn't feel for any of the characters at all: I thought they were all pretty bawdy and, oh, boo-hoo, posh people have problems, too. I think perhaps when the book was originally published, it had a greater impact on the society than it does now. These days, it just feels like regurgitated rubbish.I enjoyed Brideshead (the building) far more than I did the characters and plot: I felt much about Brideshead the same way I did about Manderlay in Rebecca. I greatly enjoy a book where the location or setting (or in this case, a building) almost becomes a character, though I do think more could have been done with the building itself and I felt like we barely scratched the surface in terms of description. It felt like an ever-looming presence and held more secrets than were divulged.Overall it was quite a quick read with some tedious moments, but I enjoyed the writing so much I will definitely be reading more of Waugh's work at some point.Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Pinterest|Shop|Etsy
