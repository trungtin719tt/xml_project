this is the book that made me not read any more of his books. It's like he woke up one morning and said, I'm done. He left countless threads unraveled. He dropped ideas. the ending was unbelievable and abrupt. All in all what could have been an amazing book was such a disappointment that it made me avoid him because I was so angry he wasted my time.
