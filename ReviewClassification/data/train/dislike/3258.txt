This one belongs to the prestigious &amp; almost elusive group of "Huge Imposters That Became Famous By People Who Suddenly Decided to Read a Novel." The book with its cute aura of a birdshape on its cover, was a mega-hit for no other reason than everyone read it. Basically, its a huge ripoff of the Judeo-Christian messiah story, with little birds that never fully become characters, grounded (ha ha) or are even particularly memorable. Is it bad to just want a mean hunter come along &amp; shoot them all down? Is this bad?I just cannot fathom the language of this; the super-precise scientific descriptions of speed, and worse, why are the birds so Anglo-Saxonly named? It is baffling as to why it even got published in the first place. Clue number one that this was gonna suck: it's subtitle, "A Story." Not, you know, a novel. Like a sketch. The photographer probably took longer taking the pictures of the grainy sky than this writer did concocting such wannabe New Age-y mierda.Reminds me so much of "The Celestine Prophecy" in it's lameness level, I could just scream.This reads like some reject for some lesser-read college Literary Anthology... But shitier.
