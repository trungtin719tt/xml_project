A woman came up to me while I was reading this book and said, "Oh, how is that book? I've been meaning to read it." I answered, "Um, well, it's kind of fun." She raised her eyebrows at me. "I see." I added, "I wouldn't pay full price for it. I got it on sale for, like, a dollar." She nodded as she began to walk away, "Okay, I know what you're saying."I can explain more if you still feel like reading this book. Honestly, I won't stop you from reading The Devil Wears Prada, I just don't suggest you push off absolutely everything else in order to do it. There are many, many more worthy books.The main character, Andrea/Andy, is just really not likeable. I wish she was. I kept trying to see her point of view. But she really bothered me. She had a great opportunity to get into the publishing business, fashion business, or whatever else. She just had to hold out for a year. Fine, she's getting four or five hours of sleep a night. I really don't care. Fine, her boss is ridiculous. But Andrea defiantly sighs at her to show her how she feels, which really, just makes her a big baby. I didn't like a lot of the people I worked for, but if you're a hardworker, you're not going to huff and puff to prove your point that all of this is beneath you. You're going to suck it up and do it. Andrea acts like the super expensive, fashionable clothes that everybody wears are ridiculous, and yes, she sells what she has at the end, but she also puts down Franco Sarto shoes and Ann Taylor (or was it Express?), which made Andy pretty hard to relate to since most people reading the book are probably wearing those things. She doesn't treat her best friend well the entire time, which okay, sometimes these things get left behind when you're busy, but come on, she was an alcoholic. Pull it together, Andy, and be a friend. And when she tells off Miranda at the end, God, I really think the author was going for that whole, Yeah, sock it to her, Andy! thing, but that's really not how I felt. I wanted to tell Andy to grow up. Wouldn't a decent person and adult have said, "Look, Miranda, my friend has been in an accident. I'm sorry if you want me to stay, but I have to go." Which, okay, that's not the best ending either, but really, don't bring up the whole friend in an accident thing, and then have Andy blow up and quit because she couldn't get Miranda's two kids some passports. (Yes, I understand that in the back of her head Andy was probably upset about her friend, but that really didn't come out at all.) There's a lot more to complain about, but really, do I have to say anything else?Weak.
