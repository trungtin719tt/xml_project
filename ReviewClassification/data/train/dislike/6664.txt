DNF @503 years after I finished this book and a year after I DNF-ed the third one I decided to give this series another chance. Obviously that didn't end well. My initial rating was 3 stars than 2 after editing and now 1 since that is what DNF-ed books get.There is interesting worldbuilding here and potentially good heroic tale but I just can't look past so many annoying characters and this time around was even worse because I knew they become even more annoying. Jordan couldn't write non-obnoxious female character even if his life depend on in it. I would cheer for all of them to die horribly but main villain and his subjects are generic, tasteless evil so I couldn't be properly on his side either.My opinion additionally deteriorated because since first time I read this book and now I read over hundred fantasy book and vast majority where better.After all this you might think I walked into this one with prejudice, knowing that I will hate it but it's not the case. I like heroic fantasy (when done properly) and I love long epics and some of my favorite people on GR love this series so I wanted to love it but and I kind of feel bad for hating it with a passion.
