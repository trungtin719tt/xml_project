I would recommend this read to anyone who wanted something easy to read that would NOT make you think.Dear John,Next time fate smiles on you: Finish your time in the Army, let fate take its course with the husband of the woman you love, Marry your soul mate, raise the autistic child of the fore mentioned and now deceased husband of the woman you love, keep your father's coin collection to honor his memory, have two children with your soul mate, and... OK finally sell the coins to pay for your children's education.Yours truly, sanityP.S. Have fun howling at the moon every month...you bleeding heart sapp!!!
