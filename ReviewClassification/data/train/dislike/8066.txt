OK. So this book is horribly written. It seems a 12 yo wrote it. I think the other books in this series are pretty good and I was so excited when I ordered it from my local bookstore. I read the first 3 pages and almost throw up. I really don't want to finish the book at all. I understand that the authors of this book are not the best but they could have done a much better job writing this book.
