During this entire book, I counted how many times Thomas ended up passing out or sleeping either at the end of a chapter or paragraph and did you want to know what the finally count was?29.29 times this guy blacked out!! Out of 360 pages, Thomas left you with the cliff hanger of "and finally he slept" 29 times. Sounds fun, doesn't it?If this didn't annoy you at all, reread this book (NOT RECOMMENDED) and realize that this dude spent most of his life passed out. Then try to tell me you didn't notice it.Although this book was fast passed, a lot of it was filler and this book could really just have been shrunken into about 100 pages at the max.I gave this book 2 stars only because James Dashner was able to create such real characters by giving them actual human qualities. This is mostly referring to Newt and Minho since they seemed the most real and fleshed out. This compared to other characters like Thomas who had about as much personality and emotion as a burnt piece of rat meat on a stick. He's also about as smart as that which I don't understand since all the Gladers were suppose to be extremely smart children who where put in the maze from the last book because of their high IQs.Apart from the few inconsistencies in this book, the one thing that never made any sense to me was that if everyone in there is suppose to be named after super smart person (like Isaac Newton, etc), then who is Frypan named after?If someone figures it out, please tell me.EDIT: P.S I think I get that Frypan is a nickname now thanks.
