I started out liking this. I was even thinking this was going to be my first four-star novel of the year. However, asHowards Endprogressed I found myself caring less and less about what was going on. By the time I was 50% of the way through I was just waiting for it to finish. I felt the exact same way aboutWhere Angels Fear to Tread. Maybe it's Forster's prose? I don't know. I think Forster and I are going to have a turbulent relationship.
