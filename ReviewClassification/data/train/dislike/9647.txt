The plot seemed to be thrown together in the end. The first three quarters were slow leading up the end that finally had me wanting to keep reading. Almost as if he started writing it and needed to hurry to bring it to conclusion. Maybe he hit his stride too late? There were holes in the story and I never really grew to like the characters so the slow part wasn't even successful there. It was certainly an easy read and somewhat entertaining, but left me wanting more.
