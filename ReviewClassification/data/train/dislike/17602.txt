Okay ... I did what everyone told me to do:1. Keep in mind that it's written from the viewpoint of the fundamental religious right.2. At the height of the Reagan era.and, I still almost couldn't finish it. I'll be the first to admit that I don't agree with Peretti's agenda, but I'll also say that I imagine that there's pleanty of "normal" Evangelicals, just as there are Republicans. But, Peretti, I hope is just blinded by his faith, and just not flat out retarded.The Cons:For some reason, I don't think Mr. Peretti buys into any religion except Christianity, the Liberal left, higher eductation, women's rights, and philosophy.His characters were pretty thin, and cookie cutter.The end is pretty Scooby-Doo. ZOINKS!The Pros:Marshall Hogan as an everyman. He was pretty much the best character in the book.I dunno. You really know what I think the best religious book out there is, and a true testament of what it means to have Faith? The Excorcist. No lie.
