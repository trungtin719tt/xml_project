Okay, I'm at hundred pages, and I'm like: someone just kill that loser Capricorn, and then FedEx the rest of the gang home! PLEASE! I'll pay Preferred!It goes like this: go here, go there, go back here, go back there, return to here, and so on...Also, this story was kind of scary, which doesn't rate high in my book (pun intended).The idea was excellent, but poorly executed.
