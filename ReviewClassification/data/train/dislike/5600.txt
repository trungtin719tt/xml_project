I'm pretty selective about new releases, butGone Girl's opening (about a man studying his wife's skull in bed) and unique alternating POV structure promised a kind of He Said, She SaidCrimes and Misdemeanors, aThe Secret Historywith a sense of humor. I did really like the structure, along with some of the zingers, and some of the saucier images, but that's about it.From the Kushner epigraph to the name checking of Noel Coward on page 68 to the use of Pygmalion as a verb 20 pages after that (a synonym forto tidy, apparently), Flynn signals that she aims to create that most perverse of marriages here: a literary beach read. Instead of the best of both worlds,Gone Girlis the worst of both worlds: as pretentious and unnecessarily meta and overwritten as the worst overhyped literary debut and with dialogue and characters as cartoonish and trite and exposition-anvil-filled as your average suspense hack job.The absolute most offensive thing aboutGone Girl, however, is how in love with being "dark" it is. It thinks it is so deep, so much better than say, chick lit, because it is about LIFE and DEATH and love as a prison sentence not rings and proposals and love as the solution to everything. But in staging itself, very Amy-like, so carefully in opposition to the thing it hates, it of course does not rise above chick lit, it just becomes psycho chick lit. Which may be different, I'll give it that, but it is not better.This is not good. Do not read this.
