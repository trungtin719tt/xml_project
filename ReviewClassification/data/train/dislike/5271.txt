I love Irving's writing andA Prayer for Owen Meanyis one of my favorite books, but I just can't get into this. I have no idea why. I've tried several times over the years. Each time I've made it a little farther into the book, but never more than three or four chapters. Maybe some day I'll try again and the book and I will just click. We shall see.
