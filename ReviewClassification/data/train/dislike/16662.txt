DNF at 34% and spoilers awl over the damn show.GIF:I am pissed.I always turn to CoHo when I'm looking for a little extra cheese on my pizza; some of her books are good like that.Maybe Somedayis one of my favorite NA reads, andFinding Cinderellahas Six, but man, I hated this book.Slammedwas tolerable. This was not.This book was beyond pissing highlighting. I was so bored, it had way too much of an angsty YA feel and holy shit I am tired of immature heroines. What attracted me to Slammed (the forbidden student/teacher romance) wasn't in here, so basically I was reading about an overly sensitive twenty-something who wanted to have sex but didn't because of some sort of stupid ass reason. I dunno, I was too busy trying to find my eyeballs, which had rolled off somewhere.Will did nothing for my lady feels. The MCs showed no signs of character development, despite the time frame between books 1 and 2. I would think that because of the circumstances, they would be a lot more mature. I think they became less mature, like for real, they went backwards or some shit. Some serious Benjamin Buttoning was taking place.There are so many unnecessary "fillers" that I skipped about 5 or 10 pages at one point and they were still eating dinner. How many pages can you write about bread sticks?There are also little "quirks" in here that I think are supposed to be cute. Like, using butterflying instead of *whispers*the f word. "I butterflying hate cheeseburgers" Will says. I can do this as well: I butterflying do not like this book.And thus ends my bitchy review.
