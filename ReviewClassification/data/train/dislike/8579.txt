I must be a masochist.Why else would I pick this book up in the first place, let alone finish it? And it was so NOT worth it. To sum up my impressions of this story -WAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!! WHYYYYYYY???**This refers to the pointless waste of an entire tropical forest on the printing of this 600+ pager in whichNOTHINGhappens. I kid you not.****Well, what else did I expect from a woman who created sparkly virgin vampires??? Hanging my head in shame.******In my defense, here is the quote from thistrainwreckbook:"Perhaps without the lows, the highs could not be reached."Maybe I expected the highs (just teeny-tiny highs) afterTwilightthe sparkly book I don't speak of?********This definitely had the aforementioned lows, but also a conspicuous absence of highs. And it didn't even have the unintentional hilarity ofTwilightsparklyseries.WAAAHHHHHH!!!!!-----------------------------------------------------------------------EXTRA! EXTRA! READ ALL ABOUT IT!There will be amovie.It IS happening (unlike the book, in which nothing is).Ok, it's old news, but I am behind on my pop culture.The important thing is - the movie stills are out.And they highlight the very important way in which it differs fromTwilight- the male love interest is wearing a *gasp*SHIRT!!! In both pictures.Proof:-------------------------------------------------------------------------Alright, enough of the silliness. Let's get to business. This book COULD HAVE HAD potential. The premise can be interesting - our planet overtaken by mind-controllingcentipedessouls, it takes people a while to realize that the invasion had happened, and the resistance emerges. Add to it that the invaders are apparently looking for little more than world peace - and this has the beginnings of a fun sci-fi-ish story.Alas, that didn't happen.**************Our lovely protagonist, ladies and gentlemen! (My vision)Let's immediately clarify - this "sci-fi romance" (as I have seen it described) is neither sci-fi nor romance.Instead we have a watered-down story of sometimes angry overprotective men pushing around and ordering around the helpless, meek, anxious, and "selfless" heroine - and occasionally carrying "their women" around (as all men are prone to doing in Ms. Meyer's books). There is a lot of brooding, glaring, staring, whispering, and murmuring (was Ms. Meyer paid extra for every instance of "murmur" in the book? It would seem so). The narration is weak, lazy, and overly dramatic. The characters are caricatures. Pages and pages go by withoutANYTHINGhappening. Boring. YAWN.This book deservesZERO stars. It is to literature whatGigliwas to movies(Anyone remember that awfulness? Probably not, as I was likely the only sane human so saw it. Again - masochism). Your time is precious; please don't waste it onThe Host.Do anything else instead - likewatching paint dry, which still would be more enjoyable.-------------------------------------------------------------------------Edited to add (in bewilderment):This "book" has a 3.86 rating on GR. Am I reading the same thing as everyone else? Was my copy of this book defective in any way?
