I hate Keira.I want to punch her. Strangle her. Ram her head through a wall and then make her eat a porcupine. Kick her in the head so hard her skull shatters. Slam a baseball bat in to her face because she just SO STUPID. I HATE THE BITCH SO MUCH THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO EXPRESS IT AND THIS BOOK SUCKED ASS.Now I don't normally like to write negative reviews but this piece of shit deserves to be cut up and burned and I will express my anger at wasting my time and money on this book through this review.First off, the stupid bitch blushed WAY to much. Whenever someone bothered to be fucking nice to the stupid girl she blushed and acted as if they had just proposed to her or something. Pull you shit together you pathetic excuse for a human being.And then there was the fact that she took so much interest in Kellen when she was dating his FUCKING BEST FRIEND. Yes sir, we have another stupid slut on our hands who can't stop eye fucking her boy friends bestie. I HATE girls like her. At the start of the book she goes on about how perfect her and her boyfriend are and then as soon as she sets her eyes on Kellen she acts as if her boyfriend doesn't fucking exist. I'm going to be honest and tell you I didn't finish this book, in fact I stopped reading it almost half way through, because I already knew exactly how it would end. The stupid bitch would get her damn fucking happy ending and I'd be left pissed off and annoyed at wasting my time on this shit.This book was a waste of time and money and I really wish I had bought it in a hard copy just so I could express my hatred for it by burning it. Keira should just go die in a bloody fucking hole and that sequel never should have happened. I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW THIS HAS SO MANY POSITIVE REVIEWS BECAUSE IT IS SO BAD. I want Keira to be murdered in the most gruesome way possible because she, like this whole book, is a piece of shit. Rant over.
