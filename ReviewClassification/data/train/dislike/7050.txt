This book started really good but then it got dumb. If you live forever and don't want anybody to know it, get some furniture. Throw away the paintings that show you in olden times. And what kind of dummy gets back together with a girl who keeps murdering his girlfriend? I wanted to be in love with this book. It was too dumb, so I couldn't. I gave it an extra star for the beginning that was really good.
