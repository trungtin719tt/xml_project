"she decided life was like manure." Well this book was like manure and this line made me finally give up. I knew when I started this that it wasn't gonna be all sunshine and rainbows since it's Nicholas sparks, but this is seriously one of the most depressing books I've ever opened. Kid with speech disabilities, single mom struggling you make ends meet, kid gets lost after a crazy accident, commitment phobic hero with a dead dad....it was bumming me out and as my life is depressing enough on its own I decided to call this one a dnf.
