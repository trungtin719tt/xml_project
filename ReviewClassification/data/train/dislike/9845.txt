My overall reaction to the end of this book was, 'So what?'. I don't understand the hype around this series. It isn't very good, it's written blatantly aimed at selling as many copies to the incredibly stupid, shallow tween American audience. How do I know this? The lack of swearing. Normal teenagers swear. "Bull poopie" is not appropriate language if you want your older audience to take the characters seriously. And the sex. The sex! What sex? What sex there is is undescribed, unnecessary and totally unrealistic. The love heptagon is ridiculous. I don't care how many men are pointlessly in love with Zoey - just freaking decide on one already! Oh, and why do all the characters have to be needlessly hot? I don't care if vampirism makes you look hot - surely to other vampires you'd just look normal. And the whole red vampire thing? Do they have to make it political?! And I swear that only happened so Stevie-Ray (LOL who decided that was a good name?! WHO!?!) didn't have to die really. I only read the books in the hopes that they would get better. They didnt.The characters? All of them, without exception, are as flat as boards. Zoey is a Mary-Sue, all her boyfriends are Gary-Stus, the evil guys are all Angry!Sues or Anti!Sues. And can I just point out, the romance between bird-guy and Stevie-Ray? Way creepy.The mythology? What a way to butcher Ancient Greek goddesses and make them look like Disney fairy princesses, Cast(s). What on Earth was she thinking, giving characters tatoos for no apparent reason but to display power. Surely an aura only detectable by other vampires or a t-shirt is okay, not body-altering and slightly disfiguring ink splats? Seriously....Overal, definitely meh.
