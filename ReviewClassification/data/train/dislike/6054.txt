It's Gone With The Wind Meets Easy Rider -- with all the phoniest elements of both American classics!All the old Southern lies are here, chillun. Slavery wasn't so bad. We weren't fighting for slavery. The war was not our fault. Slavery was not our fault. Nothing is ever anyone's fault, except for the damned meddling Yankees who started the war for no reason at all! We are all prisoners of history. We know our darkies . . . and blah, blah, blah, blah, blah!But at the same time there are plenty of groovy new lies, too. And the new lies are custom-made for an aging baby-boom generation that never quite outgrew its own monumental self-pity. Can you dig it? Here's Billy Pilgrim -- I mean, here's Inman, the dope-addled draft dodger, running from the Man. He's groovy, vacant, passive, and profoundly self-involved. He's not sexy Rhett Butler, oh no! He's empty-eyed Peter Fonda, on the road like Kerouac, looking for America and not finding it anywhere.My heart bleeds. Or not.I didn't like this book very much. But Abraham Lincoln gave it a really scathing review. "Those who deny freedom to others, do not deserve it for themselves. And under a just God, cannot long maintain it."
