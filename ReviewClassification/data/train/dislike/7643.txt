Not much to this book. Rowling uses double spacing, huge margins and mediocre pencil art (that she drew) to stretch out what should have been some short stories published on the internet, a magazine, or saved for inclusion in a bigger book. The tales are all very concise, you can tell she tries hard to make them deep and classical, but they fall short, and most fail to draw you in or make you interested. After each story is a boring (almost arrogant) review by Dumbledore, who tries to convince you how great and meaningful they are. The longest story in the book, about the brothers involved with the Deathly Hallows, is just repeated word for word from the last book in the Harry Potter series. You will glean a few tiny tidbits of information you never knew about some of the unimportant characters from the series (such as Sir Nicholas the Ghost), but otherwise this 'book' will be forgotten. A shame since I loved the main series.
