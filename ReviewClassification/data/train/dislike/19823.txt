I had to read this in high school . It was so boring it caused every particle of oxygen to be instantly sucked out of my brain whenever I opened the cover. My teacher gave me detention for falling asleep in class, I pointed to The Mayor of Casterbridge, he hit me on the back of the head with a wooden ruler. I can truly say that the classics of 19th century English literature made an impact on me.
