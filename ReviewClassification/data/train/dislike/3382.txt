When I read this in 5th grade, I really liked it for the first 75% of the story. Jess was kind of a moron, but Leslie was really cool, and I found myself wishing I had a friend who could make up great stories and imaginary worlds in our secret fort in the woods.And then Katherine Paterson decided to smack me upside the head with the cold, dead fish of Reality. (I'm not sure how that metaphor was supposed to work, but I'm going with it because that's honestly how it felt)Leslie DIED?!?!I can still remember getting to that part of the book and just sitting there saying, "Wait, what? WHAT?" I refused to believe that anyone could DIE just by falling into a creek, and still think it's a really stupid way to kill off a character.Read for: 5th grade English
