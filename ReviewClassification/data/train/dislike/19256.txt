I always wanted to read this book and I had no idea there would be a movie about it (other way I would have read it sooner), now I feel like a total loser because I watched the movie accidentally as I had no idea it would be about this book!Loved it but I can't read this book now because I know what will happen. I will be reading book 2 right away though because I just need to know what will happen to Darcy.What a great movie !So hot! Loved all the actors they chose to play the characters from this book.
