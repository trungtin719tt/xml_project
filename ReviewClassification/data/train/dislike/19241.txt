Well, this was my first, and now probably last, foray into "chick-lit." I found the characters to be totally unbelieveable. A "consummate good-girl" would never have an affair with her best friend's fiancee, despite Darcy's shortcomings as a friend. Some feel Rachel's behavior was justified because of Darcy's litany of slights, pulled from as far back as 5th grade. However that Rachel remained Darcy's friend in spite of her bitchiness, just proves Rachel's own weakness of character. And it was totally contra to her so-called good-girl persona. Could she not find any real friends? Even after growing up and living apart from Darcy for several years during college? Far from being a modern heroine, I found Rachel weak, immoral, flat, and lifeless; totally not a person to root for.
