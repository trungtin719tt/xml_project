DNF @ page 189 (for now??)I was really enjoying this book, but I feel like I'm either not in the right mood for it, or it's just too stuffed with filler that I can't slog through it to get to the good parts. I feel like it could have been seriously cut down, and tons of the characters, while connected to the main story in some way, were so much less interesting than the handful of main characters. I LOVE how dark and gory this book is, and that alone was almost enough to make me keep reading, but at the moment it just doesn't feel worth it when there are so many other spooky books I'm excited to read. I may revisit this some day, or I might just be satisfied with watching the original movie (which I still haven't seen!)
