Well, I just watched the movie by chance yesterday, I liked it.. Darcy "perfectly portrayed by Kate Hudson" is really interesting character, and her friendship with Rachel is complicated and remarkable.Then I wanted more, I find this book sample;Then I reached my twenties. And the early twenties did seem to last forever. When I heard acquaintances a few years older lament the end of their youth, I felt smug, not yet in the danger zone myself. I had plenty of time. Until about age twenty-seven, when the days of being carded were long gone and I began to marvel at the sudden acceleration of years (reminding myself of my mother's annual monologue as she pulled out our Christmas decorations) and the accompanying lines and stray gray hairs. At twenty-nine the real dread set in, and I realized that in a lot of ways I might as well be thirty. But not quite. Because I could still say that I was in my twenties. I still had something in common with college seniors.Actually the whole first chapter caught my attention. I'm not -At All- into reading Chick Lit, -but I just loved how d**k Darcy is :) !- but I enjoyed many movies of the gener.Well, the sample really amazing.. but my friends who read it did u liked it enough? Do u think it's suitable for male readers too, who..above thirty :(I realize thirty is just a number, that you're only as old as you feel and all of that. I also realize that in the grand scheme of things, thirty is still young. But it's not that young. It is past the most ripe, prime child-bearing years, for example. It is too old to, say, start training for an Olympic medal.really this part of the novel I loved.I don't know but I really considering it.
