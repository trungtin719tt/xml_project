Although this book was sold to me as a 7th-grader as a "heartwarming" memoir of children raised by an efficiency expert, I realized not too long thereafter that the book presented an insidious hidden agenda. In real life, the Gilbreth father was an acolyte of efficiency engineer Frederick "Speedy" Taylor (1856-1915), considered the founder of "the theory of scientific management." Taylorism, as it had come to be called, destroyed the craft underpinnings of much of the manufacturing industry in the US, and segmented factory workers' activities into simple, repetitious, mind-numbing tasks. While this may have increased the wealth of the owners, and, over time, provided a steady wage for some industrial workers, a fairly decent critique of Taylorism, and in particular management's treatment of workers as replaceable cogs in a well-oiled machine, rather than human beings with inherent capabilities and imagination, can be found in Harry Braverman's Labor and Monopoly Capital. If I were subjected to the indignities inflicted on the Gilbreth children by their father, I would have gone on strike, or run away from home as soon as possible. The recent Steve Martin movies, of course, have little to do with the raison d'etre of the book---any movie with Steve Martin and Eugene Levy can be guaranteed to yield plenty of laughs. Not so the book.
