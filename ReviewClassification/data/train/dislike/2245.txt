*****VERY UNPOPULAR OPINION TIME*****The majority of my friends love this book to death but I didn't. Some of my friends didn't love it so I don't feel so alone thank goodness.I tried reading the paperback awhile back and put it down. Then I picked it up again and the beginning was so good. I thought we were going to go on some kind of crazy journey when I read about the cemetery of forgotten books. It just never went where I thought it might go.I finally got the audio version on Overdrive and the narrator was wonderful, the little music parts while reading were wonderful, I just couldn't get into it.I really don't think it was my mood either even though I'm fighting a reading slump. I just didn't care for any of the characters or what was going on. It's a shame but I can't love them all, but I am glad for those that do love the book =)
