So I've had this book in my TBR list since it came out a believe almost ten years ago i think and I wish I had read it when I was younger.....because I just couldn't get into it. for me the message was as deep as a kitty cool, don't judge people by their appearance is something I learned when I was I kid, and it felt very, very forced in this book, with the dad being awful along with ever background character the one character I loved will who had learned to deal with his disabilly had it cured by magic......he was blind!! he had learned to deal with it al his life and fixing it like it didn't happen was a step back. The relationship between the main character was cute and sweet but it felt i little off with how quickly it when. *sigh* I know I would have loved this book when i was a young teen with it's cheesy massage and it's lovey dovey couple, maybe i'm too old for it now. butttt i have to say more anime voice actors should do audiobooks Chris Patton was the narrator and I loved hearing Naoya from Another.
