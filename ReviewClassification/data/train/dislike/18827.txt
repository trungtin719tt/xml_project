Fascinating premise, ineptly implemented.The author is a graduate of the Octavia Butler/Rosie Lyons School of Literature which features victims instead of protagonists.Shamelessly manipulative.The family of witches in a magic garden is a great setting for a novel. It is pathetic that the author could not do any better than this.
