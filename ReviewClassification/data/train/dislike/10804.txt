This was the book that pretty much killed my desire to read anything more by Rice. Only 3 books into the Chronicles and I was already weary of her style. As it was, the book was so dull that it took me ages to finish it.I despised a great deal of the new characters and their stories, but as usual, I enjoyed the history (particularly Egypt) where certain stories took place. I could not stand the inclusion of the whole Talamasca thing and found myself rolling my eyes whenever that mess came into play. And Louis fan that I am, I was disappointed to see so little of the character I had bonded with in the first book.Not a book I would care to ever read again.
