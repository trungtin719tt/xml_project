I feel a certain sense of guilt when I don't enjoy a classic. I find myself filled with sorrow at having missed what is so beloved or important about a text to have allowed it to stand the test of time. Nethertheless, here we are.Whilst this did not begin as an unenjoyable novel, I found myself weary with the repetition of Tom's antics, as this wore on. The headstrong Tom Sawyer, who made for such an initially witty and clever protagonist started to become, dare I say it,dull! I believe this was due to the series of scrapes and the numerous troubles he found himself in. These made for a fun reading experience, at first, as each chapter read like a separate yet interconnected short story. These many plights and fights soon began to bog the narrative down and I found the pace very stalled and, therefore, my enjoyment ultimately stunted.
