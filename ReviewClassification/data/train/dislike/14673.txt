Sorry, but I don't get it. Sorry. Blomkvist was boring and I didn't like him very much. I didn't care much about Millenium. Larsson was the MOST pedestrian writer. I know, I know ... it was translated. But that's not all that was wrong with the writing. If I had to read one more time what color t-shirt someone was wearing, I was going to lose it. And by the way, does anyone in this series ever make a commitment to anyone else, or is that just too conventional and 20th century for these oh-so-enlightened people?I certainly appreciated Salander - great heroine, and any stars I give the series are for her. But the rest was boring, the political message heavy-handed, the characters flat. The first book gave me a feel for Sweden, but the rest didn't even offer much of that, except a lot of hard to pronounce names.I wanted to love it -- people I love loved it. But I very nearly hated it and wonder what made me get through.
