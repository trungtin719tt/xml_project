Since this is a prequel to Trainspotting, I decided to read this one first. I got about an hour into the audio before realizing my mistake, as this seems like a series of disconnected vignettes about characters that the reader is supposed to already recognize. Not having read Trainspotting first, I really had trouble following along or understanding the import of the events, so I decided to DNF and start with Trainspotting instead.
