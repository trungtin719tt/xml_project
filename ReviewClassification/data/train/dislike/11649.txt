Updated: September 30th.This ismyopinion,myreview and if you don't like it,I don't care.#CHAOLWESTFALLDEFENSESQUAD-------------------------------------------------------------------------I FEEL BETRAYED.At first, I wanted to write a long, very long review aboutQueen of Fanfictionbut then i toughtWhy sould I waste my time?It's not worth it. This thing.. i call it "thing" because for me QoS is not abook,it's a very poorly written fanfiction.CONGRATULATIONS SJM FOR RUINING A GREAT SERIES!!!. I'm not exagerating. This bookruinseverything to the point ToG and CoM should be considered asstand-alone. Awesome books that were thrown to the trash can.QoS has so many plot holes, it's actually funny. But the worst is what SJM did to the characters.The Aelin we all grew to love was murdered and replaced by an OOC and even-more-arrogant new version. This new Aelin was so bad that she didn't ever care about saving Dorian, her friend.Dorian was left aside because Maas cared more about Aelin &amp; Rowan's adventures that what was really going on with his character. So sad.Chaol.. my baby. His character was completely destroyed by both Sarah &amp; Aelin. He deserved better than what he got.But you know why she did all this, right??R O W A E L I N.All for the sake of a ship.Pathetic.I'm not gonna talk about the rest. They can die for all i care.@Authors, please don't make SJM's mistakes:Don't screw characters to fullfill your own creepy fangirly obsessions. Don't change your mind mid-series. JUST DON'T.Finally. From the moment I first read Throne of Glass, it became one of my ultimate faves. Now, I feel disappointed, angry, but mostly sad. So you guys will understand why i can't keep supporting this author nor her series.I'm not gonna continue reading this trash. I'm not gonna support abusive relationships. I just can't.And for the record:CHAOLAENA IS ENDGAME, WE ALL KNOW IT.CHAOL WESTFALL DESERVED BETTER!!DORIAN DESERVED BETTER.EVEN THE FUCKING KING DESERVED BETTER.WE, THE READERS, DESERVED BETTER.
