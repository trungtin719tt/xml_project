This book is chalk full of eccentric and sometimes amusing people. Savanah's architecture and lifestyle are introduced. In all, Savanah sounds like a lovely city. I really enjoyed the martini ritual when visiting the grave ofConrad Aikenand his tombstone.After the descriptions of Savanah and it's loveliness, though, the rest of the book fell a bit flat. The people mentioned were eccentric.....but not all of them were part of the crime or the investigation. They were added purely for entertainment; they played no part in this story.The crime was glossed over, it felt. Very little was told of the investigation or findings. What came out in court seemed sloppy and disjointed.Also, the author himself admits to have "taken certain storytelling liberties, particularly having to do with the timing of events". Huh??!! That's as sloppy as the police work &amp; investigation that occurred. A true crime story where the events have been altered?!All in all, an entertaining enough read but without depth and one shouldn't consider this non-fiction. It's a fictionalized account of a crime.I'm glad I read it and also glad that I can now put it aside.
