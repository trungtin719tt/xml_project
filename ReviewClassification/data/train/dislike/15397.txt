Very unsatisfying fantasy novel. Awful writing, unconvincing and poorly thought out world design, undeveloped or pathetically two-dimensional characters, lack of suspense. Various narrators present accounts that neither correspond well nor create an interesting divergence of point of view where they disagree - the inconsistencies are so poorly used as a storytelling device that they almost appear accidental. Many sections, such as Leviticus, read like the Cetacea chapter of Moby Dick, only worse. The book's only saving grace is its ending; while as disjointed and confused as the rest of the novel, some the lines take on a quality of a haunting semi-poetry that does deserve some recognition. All in all, difficult to get through and neither provocative nor informative, would not recommend.
