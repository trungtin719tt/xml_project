I never had any desire to read this book (or Tuesdays with Morrie for that matter), but a girl in my LSAT class gave it to me to read, so I felt like I had to read it.The Five People You Meet in Heaven is an incredibly quick read. It has small pages with big font and the content is not at all challenging. You could easily read this book in a weekend. That said, I don't know if you would want to. While the book was mildly entertaining and held my interest (I kept wanting to know who Eddie would meet next), I found it to be incredibly preachy and corny. Furthermore, the moral at the end was not all that creative or enlightening (we are all connected...big woop!).So to the man on the subway who interrupted my reading to tell me that this was an amazing book and I would think of it for years to come all I can say is: sorry buddy, but this review is that last time I will think about The Five People You Meet in Heaven, unless it is to tell people that it is overrated.
