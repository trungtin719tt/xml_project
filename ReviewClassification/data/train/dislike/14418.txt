I've been longing for this day for three weeks now. When I started this book I couldn't wait for it to end. Not to find out the ending, but to be finished with the book. I really don't understand why so many people love this book. I feel that the information could have been condensed into a much smaller and more interesting book. The first 100 pages I was so totally bored I really wanted to stop reading it, but it was my book club's selection so I decided to power through. I felt like I was reading a textbook. Later I realized that I would have preferred a textbook, just the facts and nice pictures. I waited for it to get better, but it was more of the same for a really long time, I mean a really, really long time. I don't think I can recommend this book to anyone because I feel that you can get the facts in better ways and the storytelling of the characters wasn't compelling enough to warrant 750 pages. Michelangelo was an amazing prolific artist, but read an art history textbook instead.
