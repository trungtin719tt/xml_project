Okay, I realize I'm in the minority here, and I will admit that the first time I read it I went, "Aww... she loves her baby." But then I actually thought about it, and was completely freaked out by this book. This woman USES A LADDER TO CLIMB INTO HER GROWN SON'S WINDOW, PICKS HIM UP OUT OF BED AND HOLDS HIM WHILE HE SLEEPS. Do I need to repeat the "grown man" part? We've got breaking-and-entering here, along with the fact that we never once see this woman tell her son she loves him while he is, oh, I don't know, AWAKE. There's something she might try.I realize I'm probably reading far too much into a little Robert Munsch rhyming ditty, but it has become so revered by the masses that I feel the need to speak my piece. I'm done now.
