My copy of this book is nearly fifty years old. It was read to me when I was tiny and I read it to my children when they were small.When we lived in the States I discovered the play figures in a bargain bin in a toy store and bought them for my kids too. This guy was always my favourite!He looks as if he's up to no good.There are several key elements to the book's power.1. The artwork is special.2. It shows, graphically the power of imagination.That very night in Max's room a forest grewand grew until his ceiling hung with vinesand the walls became the world all around3. It undermines the fear of monsters without taking away the wonder.4. Even when you're bad, your mother loves you.I can't see this book going out of print. It's timeless.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes..
