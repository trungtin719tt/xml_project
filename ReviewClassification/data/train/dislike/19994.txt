What a pedantic piece of hippy-dippy drivel. The message of this book may have been appreciated in the 70s, but it has failed to stand the test of literary time. Up to this point, I thought that Hemingway won the award for grossest patriarchal American writer, and...I still do. Robbins is, however, worse, as he does it under the guise of 'female liberation'. It's fucking embarrassing. Oh, and you know who I never really warmed up to? ANY CHARACTER IN THE BOOK. I don't care about your thumbs, pseudo-lesbianism, penis-dangling 'Chink', New York socialite life, or indefatigable need to hitchhike. STFU. Where have all the cowgirls gone?
