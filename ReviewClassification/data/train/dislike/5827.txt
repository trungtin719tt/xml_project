One of my least favorite Grisham's books, and that's saying something. Actually I kind of likedThe Pelican Briefand one or two of his others, but mostly they strike me as mediocre writing combined, more often than not, with pulpit-pounding and breast-beating about some legal issue.In this case the setting is a murder trial for a African-American man who gunned down his 10 year old daughter's rapists, who are stereotypical Southern white trash racists who tried to murder this little girl and left her for dead. The legal question is whether jury nullification is sometimes justified. Grisham, as par for the course, loads the dice on that issue.I've only read as many of Grisham's books as I have because my father-in-law (another voracious reader) thought that because I was a lawyer I would automatically like Grisham books, so I regularly received them from him as birthday and Christmas presents. My FIL is gone now, may he rest in peace, so no more Grisham for me.
