It was clear from the start that this wasn't great literature by any means--but for the first part of around 200 pages I found it gripping. One of those sagas where you enjoy a panorama of history and watching two powerful characters clashing. The story follows two men born on the same day in 1906. William Kane Lowell, a Boston Brahmin and Abel Rosnovski, the illegitimate son of a Polish baron. We follow their parallel but contrasting from boyhood. Both prove themselves at first both extraordinary and sympathetic. We watch self-contained William shrewdly build on his fortune, making his own money buying and selling matchbox cars to his classmates, building a stockmarket portfolio while still a schoolboy, and struggling against his feckless stepfather. Meanwhile Abel comes into his inheritance, learning he's his father's son even as he loses everything to the Russians in the wake of World War I and emigrating to the United States with only a few dollars coming off the boat.My problems with the books began when their lives began to intersect. Too many coincidences moved the plot, too many misunderstandings and pettiness factored into their enmity and the resolution was too cliched.
