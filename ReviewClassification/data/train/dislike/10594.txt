I had the same feeling after reading this as I had after readingThe Looking Glass Wars. Fabulous idea, terrible execution. I was going to give it one more star than I gave that because it's not quite as badly written. And I liked the idea of door-to-door Baconians andRocky HorrorizedRichard III. But I changed my mind because the more I think about it, the more I didn't like it.It was so smug and cutesy and in need of better editing. And it would have been better served by not being written in first person, especially since it kept slipping into other people's heads when it should have been in Thursday's. Also, Thursday is really boring and doesn't have an interesting voice, and I didn't care about her at all (and, ick, that moment where she gets out her mirror and contemplates her looks). The same goes for most of the other characters. The only one I really liked was Thursday's father, and he barely had anything to do with anything. And the villain! How utterly boring. Villains are only interesting if they're something beyond mwahahaa so evil.And it was just a mess. So much random crap was going on that seemed to have nothing to do with anything. And I could have lived without the "romance" which was just yawningly boring and tacked on. And the names. Ugh. I wanted to stab my brain out having to read some of those awful names.Most people seem to adore this book and the rest of the series, but I thought it was pretty terrible. Maybe the writing gets better in later books, but I don't think I'll give them a chance.Very disappointing.
