Sometimes I really wonder what young adults see in certain young adult books. This series has pretty good ratings but I just don't see it. I was so bored for the first eighty percent of the book. I felt as if I had no idea who this heroine really was. I don't even think it says how old she is until late in the book, which left me feeling a little off about her character. Since each year makes a big difference when it comes to teens, not knowing if she was twelve or seventeen was weird. So much of the story was a bunch of old English people sitting around talking to each other.The story of the guardians and the time travelers is so full of plot holes, and so many questions that I have aren't even alluded to. Or if they are answered, it's basically with a big ole question mark. As if the author didn't really know how to explain why there is an apparent "time travel" gene. She just allows the characters to say "Well, we're not really sure." Why one male, one female? No clue. It just is. What's the point of the time traveling if it's only for a few minutes to a couple of hours? It seems so pointless. There's no fantasy here, just an odd, secretive political intrigue about a secret society of once-a-generation time travelers who go back into time to...what, talk to other time travelers? I just don't see the point. They're not doing anything meaningful, just hopping back and forth and arguing about it.I may continue the series if I get a wild hair all of a sudden. The last twenty percent was actually fairly fast paced and interesting, finally. The romance peeks out for half a second, there's some blood and guns and swords and chasing.And then it ends extremely abruptly. So abruptly, in fact, that I thought that my audiobook had failed to finish transferring to my phone. I actually went and checked the library's website and my Overdrive account to see if the entire last part downloaded. It was weird. And frustrating.
