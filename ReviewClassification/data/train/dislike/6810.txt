An angst-ridden teenager. Placed in a foreign location. A boy (for no apparent reason) falls for her. She starts to show her real personality. She and her father reconnect. Her father coughs. Revelations start coming out of everywhere. Her mother is not so great after all. Her dad's dying (see above: cough). She verbally abuses the boy and he kindly takes it, because he's a gentlemen. He leaves. Her dad dies. She's matured as a person. She goes home and completes the task her father left her with. The boy returns. They kiss. The end.As with every other book written (by Sparks and others), this book follows the typical teen plotline. There is nothing fascinating, compeling or unique. There is nothing endearing about the aggressive Ronnie and nothing deep or revealing about her relationship with Will, there only connection seems to be angst. Her parents got divorced. His kid brother died.If you want to be manipulated to the point of tears, then at least have the decency to pick the *slightly* better "The Notebook" not this shallow "The Last Song."
