This book didn't have a chance with me.1. It was written from the perspective of a five-year-old boy.2. For the first two thirds of the book the kid was annoying.3. The mom breastfeeds the kid a lot. I counted twelve times before I stopped counting. The kid creeped me out by talking about which boob tasted better.Why read it?It was this month's selection for a book club I am part of. It wasn't my pick.Why two stars rather than one?Well, I'll be damned if I didn't start to feel sorry for the poor kid and like him despite myself. A writer who can do that to me deserves an extra star.
