This book made me mad. The main character, a spoiled 17-yr-old, has been shop-lifting, staying out all night, and disrespecting her mother. Mom only knows about the last part and decides that darling daughter should spend the summer with the father that walked out on the family 3 yrs earlier. Upon arriving at Dad's place in NC, darling daughter takes off (not run away, but certainly coming and going as she pleases) and immediately pals around with kids she thinks are like her. Yes, they are brooding, too, but they also sleep around, do drugs, and beat up the people they are robbing. Meanwhile, Mom tells Dad that she is concerned about darling daughter and his response is that darling daughter knows right from wrong and will, therefore, be fine. Huh? In Nicholas Sparks' world she also immediately meets the gorgeous jock she is going to fall for. (He inexplicably ignores his former cheerleader girlfriend who throws herself at him.) All that in the first 50 pages. Here in the real world, darling daughter would soon be pregnant, on drugs, or both. Because the dedication mentioned Mylie and Billy Ray Cyrus, I can only imagine that the book and movie end with darling daughter and father reuniting over the last song they sing together, but I didn't stick around to see that Disney moment. I liked some of Sparks' other books (usually the lesser known ones), but don't recommend this drek to anyone.
