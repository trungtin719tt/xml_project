Too many similes, too much teenage angst (but that's probably why so many teens read it, right?) too many witty repartees in life-threatening situations that don't even begin to help me suspend my disbelief. Oh, and EVERYBODY'S MONOLOGUING! When someone has a sword pointed at their heart they get all morose and suddenly divulge their deepest secrets, but just enough that when they don't die, the reader has all but one piece of the puzzle. So we're basically left almost knowing how things are going to end (and let's be honest, we really are smart enough readers to put it all together), but things aren't going to end for another 150+ pages.And yet I keep reading the series because I'm a glutton for punishment and there's a glimmer of romance. A very small glimmer. The second and third books continue to flog the dead horse of Jace + Clary drama and I got bored but I HAD TO KEEP READING in spite of all of that. It's not my proudest moment. I just wanted to find out if I was right (AND I TOTALLY WAS) and I called it halfway into the first book.Sorry about all the yelling.I think the world Clare creates is great. The premise of a whole other world coexisting with ours is clever and she pulls it off well. All of the beings live by their rules (some conventional, some a little more creative)and she keeps it together pretty well. I just got bored with waiting for her to finally come around and tell me what I already knew. I think it also didn't help that I listened to the whole 3 books and listening takes a lot longer than reading. I did get a quilt done in the interim though.Maybe in the 4th book it gets better?
