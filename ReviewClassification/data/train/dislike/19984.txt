Awful. Just awful.Though the author does sometimes have a charming way with words, more often than not that way is overshadowed by his by-now-extremely-dated New Age philosophy and "aren't-I-a-fantastic-writer?" ego.Meanwhile, you're doing the difficult and mind-numbingly unappealing work of attempting to dredge up half a liking for a single one of his cardboard characters (who are presumably meant to be intriguing one-and-all due to some bizarre and randomly-assigned attribute, and who, weirdly, all sound *exactly like the narrator* when they speak, with the exception of an occasional half-assed catch-phrase such as "podner", or gesture such as mustache-stroking. Way to excel at dialogue and characterization, dude...) while trudging through the convoluted and incredibly uninteresting plot. Add in a disturbingly misogynistic 1970s concept of sexuality (women apparently only dabble in lesbianism if there doesn't happen to be a dick around... oh, and all women and young girls are seemingly down with uninvited sexual contact, even when it takes the form of molestation by creepy dudes in cars, 'cause that's not gross at all) and you have a novel it took me three freaking weeks to get through, when the typical amount of time I'd spend on a book of this length is closer to three hours. The time would have been far better spent reading some dry scientific tome about whooping cranes rather than filling my head with these characters, these storylines, this dreck. This... this is Ayn Rand for hippies.Oh, and also, apparently fat women just plain lose all ability to focus at the mere mention of sweets. Why? Because Tom Robbins is a sexist ass and can't help proving it every other page or so, just in case you didn't believe him the first hundred or so times he tried to make that patently clear. And he'll keep right on proving it, again and again, until the very end of the book. Ugh.
