One day a flower grows out of Laurel's back. Shortly thereafter she discovers she's a plant. Luckily her would be boyfriend is OK with dating a plant, in fact he thinks it's kind of cool. This of course raises the question as to what he was really doing with that iceberg lettuce in his room.The premise of this book is whacked enough that I really should like it...sorry to say it just wasn't working. There was a lot of talk about petals which was just creepy, and would be boyfriend even asked if he could touch her petals, to which she demurely agreed.Then there was the mouth to mouth experiment where she breathed out oxygen and he breathed out carbon dioxide. Personally I always thought the touching of the petals came after the mouth to mouth...seems I was wrong.The good v. evil battle towards the end redeemed the book a little, but not nearly enough. Still it is the authors debut novel and I can forgive a lot in a first effort.
