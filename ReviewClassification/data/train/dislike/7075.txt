First of all, I read this book in my native language and I think much of the BFG's way of speaking was lost in the translation process. While reading, I was constantly wondering what the original words might have been.Second, my son had to readThe BFGfor school. I think the story failed to fully capture his attention. So, he found himself in the situation in which tomorrow is the Reading Club at school and he didn't read it. As his reading speed is quite low for his 8 years, I read the book to him.The BFGwas a nice read, but I'm not a huge fan either. This type of story is not what I usually go for. Even as a child, my feelings would have been the same. I like princesses, and princes, and dragons, and... well, pretty much everything that was not in this book.I hope my son's next Reading Club book isgirlier(so I can enjoy it if I have to read it). :)
