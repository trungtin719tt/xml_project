Here's my daughter reading PippiFirst, the story. Pippi was written in the 1940's and it's still utterly captivating to this generation. Pippi issuchan endearing character, irreverent, infectiously ridiculous and charmingly caring. Bonus to all kids everywhere: she makes adults look silly and kids look brilliant. She champion's the kids world: all imagination and no rules. Anything is possible and everything is an adventure. She's like the imaginary friend we'd like to be, except, in the end, she makes us grateful we have our mums and dads and homes (oh, she gets a little emotional, despite her fearless bravado).This is one of those kids books I am not inwardly groaning when it's time to read to my daughter (although I did love it more when I was still a girl, myself). My 7 year old is the perfect age for this, able to read it herself, but liking me reading it to her more (of course ;))Oh, and this 2011 edition is completely gorgeous, guys. Random picture evidence:I loved this as a kid. I adored the movie (I can still sing along to all the songs, haha). Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Ephraim's Daughter Longstocking of Villa Villekulla is a timeless character and I hope she continues to be loved by children of upcoming generationsPeace out,Nomes(me and Carissa x)
