For me think was a mediocre historical fiction / romance story set to the back drop of World War. I failed to connect with any of the characters as I listened to this one on audio and it became pretty annoying with the over use of certain words and I didn't engage with any of the dialogue which seemed trivial and never ending.A story of a young American Frederic Henry who volunteers for service with the Italian Army in World War I and falls in love with his English Nurse.I am not a fan of "romance Stories" or tales of all consuming love and that is pretty much how I felt about this one, and it wasn't what I was looking for in War novel. It was an ok read for me but certainly not one for my favourites shelf. I just couldn't engage with the characters and I found Catherine's character so annoying and strange. The overuse of certain words and ridiculously long sentences grated on my nerves. The narrator was quite good but because there was such a repetition of certain words I felt he kept over emphasising them.This wasn't at all what I was expecting from an Ernest Hemingway novel and I picked this one up expecting something quite different and this book just didn't deliver and perhaps I should have paid better attention to the blub of this one as it had too much love story and not enough war action for me.My favourite fiction novels on World War one areBirdsongandA Long Long Way
