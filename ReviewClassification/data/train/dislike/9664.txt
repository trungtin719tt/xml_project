I wouldn't ordinarily read a book like this purely based off the summary. But all the 5 star reviews had me convinced it must be worthwhile.Sadly, this was the worst book I've read in quite some time. Horribly written, lacking a true plot line, and characters were vague with strange emotional reactions to crucial moments. Someone he hardly knew was killed in front of him and he was haunted for months. But his brother was shot a few feet away and not a single thought but to kiss his girlfriend and celebrate getting out of town for a while? Ok, tooootally makes sense.So dumb - disappointed I wasted the money.
