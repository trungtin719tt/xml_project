I had to read this book for school and it is one of the worst books I have ever read.The plot was ignorant and unbelievable, the characters were boring, and I felt like I was being preached to the entire time. None of this should come as a surprise considering it is a Christian novel with an agenda of course. I especially found it absurd that the villains would be controlled by demons while engaging in Eastern meditation and preaching unity and self-awareness.I understand that this book was supposed to be about the power of prayer or something like that, but it seemed to me that it was more about the evils of New Age religions and philosophy. I could have looked past this if the story was at all interesting or engaging, but at one point I almost fell asleep while trying to get through this book. It is that dull.
