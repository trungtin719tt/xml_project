I found this book unbelievably phoney.I hated this so much that I got up early this morning to finish it and gave my copy to the library and honestly, I'm not too proud of that.To me it just felt so insincere that there's no chance I would have made it past the second chapter had it not been for book club obligations.I enjoyed her writing style, but I absolutely could not warm to her at all. To be fair, I do think she would be an excellent travel writer.The section on India was agony to read.I have met enough people freshly returned from Indian ashrams to know that they often seem a tad self absorbed and I also suspect that they really only get up at 3am so that they have even more "me" time.She didn't do much to alter my opinion.Honestly, this woman meditated longer, harder and bluer than anyone else has, past or present. She won the meditation competition that no-one was actually having.Possibly it was not enlightenment that she found, but simply that she finally became completely self absorbed.Easy mistake to make.
