I still have such a hard time accepting that this stark dystopian series was aimed at middle school young adults, and knowing that even younger children are reading it (with parental approval). Yes, Katniss is a strong heroine, but the book is bereft of other lasting loyal human friendship except between the two sisters. Almost everything and everyone else is for sale or manipulation. I read the whole trilogy hoping in vain for redemption, revolution among the children at some point. The trilogy should come with an enormous warning for parents and teachers to read the set first to see if they want their kids to get caught up in this sad view. Yes, Harry Potter has darkness also, but it has a wide team of strong kids and adults who care for each other and stand by each other. Yes, they have their own weaknesses--they are well-drawn characters in the Potter series--but they are ultimately working for good and against evil. In the Hunger Games, nearly anyone will betray anyone and can be sold out for survival, and no one can be trusted. A desperately bleak world view. I know I am in the minority here, but I don't get the popularity, except for the strength of Katniss. What am I missing?
