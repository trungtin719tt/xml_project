I wanted to like this book, but couldn't, as hard as I tried. The writing felt forced, almost like a translation, but there was no mention of a translator, so I am guessing it was written in English. On a structural level, I felt the novel was disjointed - going back and forth in time between too many superficially developed characters. I was confused by the use of informal, modern-day colloquialisms in the 13th century voices - these expressions were so well-integrated into the novel that it seems to have been a deliberate choice on the part of the writer, but it made the narration seem very unrealistic.On a deeper level, knowing nothing about Sufism, I finished the book feeling at best ambivalent and at worst antagonistic toward the Sufi characters and those influenced by Sufism. I tried to be open-minded, but Shams of Tabriz seemed arrogant, self-righteous, and self-absorbed (insufferable comes to mind)rather than ego-less and selfless, and Rumi's absolute indifference toward his younger son seemed to have contributed to the heartless choices Aladdin ended up making at the end. Additionally, I could not forgive Ella for abandoning her children, particularly her adolescent daughter with bulimia. What bothered me is that the writer seemed to be condoning and even glorifying these choices as being spiritually enlightened, in the name of love.In general, the book felt too weighted and serious, and needed more lightness and humor to be enjoyable.Also, it was just bizarre that the author suddenly injected information about Ella's father's suicide into the narrative, and only referred to it once more in the entire book. This kind of seems like an important part of the story, which deserves further exploration.However, there were some moments of compelling writing, and the book did get me interested in learning more about Sufism in particular and mysticism in general - as well as being more open to spirituality in everyday life.
