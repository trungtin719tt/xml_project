This book had the potential to be amazing: affluent teens learn in their fifteenth year that they are reincarnated vampires who will never really die, only come back to reenter another 'cycle' of life.unfortunately, it was terrible. One gets the impression that La Cruz either rushed through this, or had a constant bout of writers block. The writing is forced and trite, and things that should have been ommitted (why do we need a description of every single item of food throughout the book?)and some parts were montaged where they should have been described in detail (like when they found out they were blue bloods) and if I hear one more designer clothing reference, I'm going to punch something.Also, it's not a good thing if the name 'Schuyler' is the most normal in the entire book. 'Bliss?' 'Perfection?' really? If your going to have your book set in a mdern, realistic setting, make it seem like it could possibly happen.also, the character of Schuyler is much too stereotypical for my tastes. A beautiful-gothic-orphan-outcast becomes a vampire? How original! She had no character faults at all, which makes for a very bland, boring heroine.It also took La Cruz 248 pages to get to the frickin' point, where the plot starts to... well, exist. Until then, the word 'vampire' isn't even mentioned, and though we all knew what was going on, the fact was presented as though it were a huge surprise, which insults my intelligence, thankyouverymuch.Fortunately, the last fifty pages were much better then the first 5/6 of the book, and though no definate conclusion is reached, I don't feel inclined to pick up the next in the series.
