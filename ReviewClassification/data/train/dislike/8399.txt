Ugh, I don't even know why I'm bothering with this. I really wanted to slap a one star on it which I don't do unless I've actually finished the book but, yanno what? I'm gonna do it anyway.Apart from being a very poorly written account of the life of the single worst female protagonist I have ever,everread about, this booked is rampant with stereotypes, derogatory terms, slut-shaming and the weirdest paragraph ever written about a gay character:...Usually he isn't so overtly gay. Not that the fabulous Damien Maslin isn't actually gay. He totally is. But he's also a tall, brown-haired, big-eyed cutie who looks like he'd be excellent boyfriend material (which he is-if you're a boy). He's not a fluttery-acting gay kid, but get the boy talking about shopping and he definitely shows some girlish tendencies...What in the literal fuck does that even mean? WHAT IN THE LITERAL FUCK IS THAT PARAGRAPH?If you're not offended enough by that alone, there's also casual use of the word "retarded" and a horrifying scene where Zoey treats a homeless person like they are actually the scum of the earth.Ugh. Burn this book. BURN THIS BOOK.
