A stream of human unpleasantness, cruelty, cynicism, lovingly described pain and brutalities, lascivious dwelling on injury and slaughter and gratuitous death. Basically, these books are badly written torture porn. Deeply unrewarding, lacking in affirmation, and worse, rather insincere due to the lack of emotional impact and paucity of credible characters. Character development is replaced by facile violence whilst empathy is reduced to no less cheap empty sentiments, meaningless words trotted out. I could not care for any of the characters, who were a thoroughly unpleasant bunch for the most part, the lead characters lacking in credibility and real motivation; the good supporting characters few and far apart and always boringly bland and destined to die, the bad ones tirelessly verminous, either violent propagators of pain or uninterestingly, obliviously selfish. The romantic subplot was handled with the subtlety of mouldy porridge and the same level of emotional range. This is a trilogy that is at least three books too long, poorly paced, a truly powerful story and concept let down by characterless characters and a colourless, workmanlike prose that is the literary equivalent of whatever Kristen Stewart is doing when she's trying to act.
