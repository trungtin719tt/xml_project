EDIT:As of 5/16/2011, I have re-read this book and realized that my four star rating was because of the sex scenes. I still maintain the content of my review, but I do not think this book holds the same value as my other four star books. Anyway, thanks for reading. Also, my spoiler tag comes off because I doubt that I'm really spoiling anything you wouldn't have figured out from the blurb.I really don't know how to feel about this book. In some ways it's better than Flowers in the Attic. In others, it's worse.If anything, it was too predictable. It was obvious that Lochan and Maya would get caught having sex. It was obvious that their mother would find them. And it was obvious that Kit knew something was up.The Good1. MayaI liked Maya. She did what she wanted and she actually initiated their relationship. It's a nice change to see the girl as the dominant one in a relationship.2. The ChemistryWhy lie? Lochan and Maya have chemistry. I'm not for incest. I'm very anti-incest. But in fiction, if it works, it works. And it worked here. I believed that they were really in love -- or at least in lust.3. KitDespite his betrayal, I grew to like this little idiot. At first, he was kind of the cliche bad mouthed little brother, a la Riley Freeman. But I warmed up to him in the last 100 pages or so.4. The ChemistryYes, I mentioned it twice. Lochan and Maya have chemistry. Authors out there reading this, why is Tabitha Suzuma able to make me want these two together but you're unable to make me think the same of your couple?5. The PacingI was able to get through this pretty fast. I finished it in less than four hours.The Bad1. No CreativityAt least VC Andrews was creative. This is a pretty standard taboo romance. We have a vicious circle. Let me give you an example:Lochan: Oh Maya, that feels so good.Maya: Yes, Lochie. I know. If only we could go further.Lochan: No! It's wrong! It's disgusting! Go away!Maya: But we were just -- fine. I don't love you.Lochan: Wait. I'm sorry.Maya: Me too.Lochan: Oh, Maya, that feels so good.Put this on repeat for about four hundred pages. Crank up the level of intimacy every one hundred pages. That's the plot until they get discovered. Yes, I'm being callous. Their situation is serious, but this just felt a little repetitive, especially when there's no other plot.2. The DialogueSeriously, I liked Maya and Lochan, but they were laying it on too thick. 'I Love You' and 'I Love You Too' gets a little old after a while. Please, get a room.3. The PacingThis could have used an editor. One hundred pages could have been cut and nothing would have been sacrificed.4. The ParentsI suspended my belief over their situation at times. I know stuff like this actually happens, but I felt like it could have been handled a little better.5. The ChemistryAfter a while, they were running to rip off their clothes. I like intimate conversations every now and then. I wanted more build up to the realization of their feelings for one another and less ship-tease between the moment they realized said feelings and when they actually had sex.Also, I liked Nico. I hated the way he was pushed aside. Why did he even have to exist if Maya was going to ditch him for Lochan?6. The WritingThis would have worked better if it was told in third person. I didn't believe for one second that teenagers(especially since I am one) think like this. At times, the writing was pretty. At other times it was overwrought. Also, like in Shiver, I couldn't tell the difference between Lochan and Maya's voices.2.5 Stars.
