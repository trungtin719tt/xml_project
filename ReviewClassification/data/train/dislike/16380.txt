DNF at 24%Alternate title for Will Grayson, Will Grayson:Disappointment, Disappointment.John Green,I thought we had a thing going. You write incredible heart-wrenching books, and I cry about them and recommend them to everyone in existence. So what the hell happened with this?I said in my review of Eleanor &amp; Park that never have I ever been so glad to check a book out from the library. You can just go ahead and scratch that now. I'm happier that I gotthisfrom the library.In the first 23 pages, I was hit with enough teenage angst to last me a lifetime. I couldn't even make it to page 100.Where to begin? The writing style was ridiculous. Will #2's POV was written like this:nothing was capitalized. everything was lowercase. not even names, like "will". not even "i".And that bugged the ever-loving shit out of me.The characters weren't much better. "Insufferable" is the best word I can think of to describe them. Yes,all of them.All of the main characters, at least. Will #2 was utterly annoying, Will #1 acted a bit like an asshole, and Tiny, the character who I thought would save the book for me, let me down.Ar first when I read the book's synopsis, I thought it sounded really interesting. But then I started the book, and my analysis began. Two guys who havethe same exact first and last namejusthappento randomly meet?Before you start thinking, "It's possible to meet someone with the same last name and first name as you, you idiot", allow me to explain. This would be more believable if their last name was something like "Smith" or "Johnson." But no, their last name isGrayson. Maybe it's just me, (and it's probably just me) but I have never metanyone, in my entire life, with the last name Grayson. The name Will I can understand. I know three Wills. But no Graysons. I'm not saying itcouldn'thappen. It's just seems a little unlikely.I really wanted to like this book. But unfortunately, it just was not for me.
