2.5 StarsI consider myself a Steinbeck fan but I definitely did not like this one as much as his other work.I found this book to be a departure from his earlier work and it lacks the charm and endearing quality of his novels from the beginning of his career. I found this painfully boring although it did interesting things with the exploration of themes of America and its descending morality. I couldn't get into it and did not connect to the characters. I felt no sympathy to Ethan Hawley at all.I will read all of his work and there's bound to be ones that don't do it for me.
