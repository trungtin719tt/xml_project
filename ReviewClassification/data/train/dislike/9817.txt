Maybe it was because I'd just finished reading Holly Black's Valiant and Ironside, two of my favorite books in this genre, but I really did not think very highly of Wicked Lovely. Compared with Black's books, I found this one to be badly paced, full of one-dimensional, undeveloped characters and lacking a lot of detail. Aislinn is rather whiny and unremarkable, with no defining characteristics except for the Sight, so it's hard to see why everyone loves her so much. Her friends are completely flat and expendable, judging by the fact that we don't see them past page 50 or so. Seth is also one-dimensional, a cardboard cutout of a boyfriend whose only purpose is to serve Aislinn. When have you ever seen a boy with a navel ring, anyway? Keenan is also dull, with no personality or characteristics beyond being the driver for the plot, and Beira is possibly the most archetypal, undeveloped villain with no motives other than being evil for evil's sake. Only Donia is somewhat enjoyable. The plot moves too slowly at the beginning, and we are forced to read about Aislinn whining about how faeries are evil for over a hundred pages. Then, suddenly, she changes her mind and decides that she kind of likes bossing people around, and everything is very neatly squared away at the end. The premise was interesting, but nothing was ever properly explained. The plot was full of holes and the detached, one-dimensional characters made it hard to care about getting through the book. Hopefully Marr's next work will be better, because this one was a sore disappointment. Don't be fooled by the pretty cover.
