This might be more of a 2.5 but idk.I might have liked this better if I didn't listen to the audiobook for part of it, but the narrator just gave these girls attitude with their voices and I ended up picturing the characters as that and it was so bad.Basically all the characters, especially Sam (not as much Kent) annoyed the crap out of me and I didn't really love the repetitiveness of the book (though that is the point). Most of the characters are terrible people. There is a bit of redemption, but for the most part they're just still terrible.The end was pretty great and I enjoyed the book more as it went on, but the first few chapters were just too much for me.
