Hours of my life I will never get back were wasted reading this--and I rarely feel that way.Somethingmade me keep turning the pages, but this book is horrible. The romance is unconvincing, the characters flat, the mythology annoying, and there is something cringe-worthy (the names, for one! Ever? Summerland? Haven? are you kidding me?!) on each and every page--quite a feat!It's a cheapTwilight SagaandSouthern Vampire/Sookie Stackhouse Mysteriesrip-off. Sure, many of the aforementioned criticisms could be leveled against those (neither series is great literature), but the first has--IMHO--a real magical quality to it, and the second is oh-so-effortlessly-charming in that irresistibly Southern way. If these books were drinks,TwilightandSookiewould be inexpensive--but very drinkable--champagne: just one more glass... OK, one more... how many have I had? oh hell, fill her up dahhhhling... *sigh* the bottle is empty, but the world is just wonderful, wonderful, wonderful ... ... ... ... ... ... *upon waking* the horror! the horror!... but... I bet I'll do it again some other time. This book, thisEvermore, this colossal embarrassment of a novel, would be warm Pabst. Don't go there, no matter how desperate you are.If you are looking to capitalize on the paranormal romance experience, I suggestSunshine, by Robin McKinley, andA Certain Slant of Light, by Laura Whitcomb.P.S. I'm putting it on my vampire shelf despite the hilarious insistence that the creatures in this book are not vampires (vampires arefake!) butimmortals. Oh, and there's an annoyingly stereotypical redheaded villianess (she just doesn't know how to luuuuuurve--oops, is that a spoiler?), so it goes on the redhead shelf, too.
