I was reminded of Sheldon's books through my "feed" here and thought I must add them! As I remember, these were the "50 shades" of their time. Not due to sexual content, even if these is some, but rather the ones you didn't mention reading, or the "guilty pleasures". Also known as: I read this even though I know it's trash"I'm exaggerating of course, I would never read "50 shades".But I was quite shocked realizing what amazing average ratings a lot of these books have! I should read them again. Just kidding, I really wouldn't.True page turners, beautiful people, dramatic (if predictable) and sex is what I remember. And I do remember good enough to put this rating ("ok", since it's certainly readable).
