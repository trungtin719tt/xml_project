Markedis one of the worst written books I've read in a long, long time. It is incomprehensible how an intelligent and/or civilized person could enjoy a book like this. Although it's understandable how someone could get swept up in the average, mundanely composed storyline, the writing - oh man, I think I might have lost a few brain cells. Hopefully reading this book hasn't permanently damaged my own writing.One of the most annoying things was Zoey, the main character, had a tendency to think in random tangents (hee hee, see that alliteration! They all start with t!) She also had a massive, gargantuan amount of immature catchphrases. By the end of the book I felt like ripping my hair out every time I read one of the following: "Oh, hell!" "Oh, crap!" "Ah, crap." "*insert unnecessary cuss word!* Seriously, Cast pretty much included a cuss word or reference to sex or drugs in every other sentence. It's realistic when an author includes the occasional cuss word or discreetly mentioned sexual innuendo. But when the main character starts spewing stupid things like how large her teacher's chest is, it's just plain irritating.Oh, and Zoey has officially earned her rank in the top five most annoying protagonists of all time. I refuse to believe that ANY teenage girl could empathize with her - when people say things like "oh, this book would be perfect for teenage girls!", or "I didn't like this, but a girl might!" I almost cringe in disgust. Zoey is mindless, exasperating, and completely one dimensional. She is pretty much the anti-role model. One moment she's discussing the utter normality of sex, the next moment she's talking about how wrong it is to want to kiss a boy. Hypocrite, anyone?1.5 stars, rounded up to two. The first reason is because after reading this novel I'm more aware of whatnotto do if I decide to write a book. The second reason is because sometimes the plot was so pointless it was actually funny.
