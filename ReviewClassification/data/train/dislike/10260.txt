This story about the last unicorn and her quest to find out what happened to all the other unicorns has become one of the most popular stand-alone fantasy novels of the last 50 years or so. What may have appealed to the hippies/baby-boomer generation as a witty parody of fantasy tropes (stickin' it to the man!) seems morose and melancholy in the modern age, and there are times the plot slows down enough that you might need to crack open a Red Bull (har!). Those who can't get enough unicorns may find it noteworthy that there is a sequel short storyTwo Heartsavailable for free online at the author's website.
