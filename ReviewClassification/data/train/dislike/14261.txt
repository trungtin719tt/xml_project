How irritating is it when you read the next book in a series, and then you realize that the story was dependent upon some short story that came in-between and you didn't read it??No, I don't want to read the crappy short story that came before this! You're not the boss of me!Plus, Sookie is now getting involved with Quinn, whom she met once and then is thinking about sleeping with him. It's weird. She was a nice girl, virgin, until the age of 26, and now she's sleeping around with every supernatural being in the state of Louisiana (which is a lot with New Orleans and all). She's become the village bike cuz everyone has taken a ride. (or, should it be the village broom because everyone magical has taken a ride?)And, she's a total idiot because Eric is still interested. Need I remind you?She picks a bald dude who turns into a tiger (and she said looked like a genie) over him? She's dumber than I thought!So, we have Sookie traveling to New Orleans to pack up her cousin, Hadley's, household since Hadley died and left her everything. This puts her in the path of the Queen of Louisiana, who was Hadley's girlfriend. Sookie gets involved with the court politics of the queen. And, someone is trying to kidnap/kill heragain. This girl is marked.She finds out a few tasty nuggets of information along the way. The first being that Bill is a big fat lying user. The second is that she has fairy blood in her."that blood would explain why you have supernatural suitors and not human admirers."Well, thank you for giving us an explanation as to why every single supernatural being is following Sookie around like a lost puppy. She is like magic-bait or something. And, the vampires are especially attracted to fairies. That information takes Sookie down a notch or two.So, Sookie:But, bless your heart!The book wasn't all that bad, but I just don't like New Orleans (I live somewhat close), and I don't like books that pull the you-had-to-read-the-half-book-to-get-this crap.
