Did not finish! Just too much of a romance novel for me to stomach finishing it.I really understand the importance of character development. But chapter after chapter of how much Day misses June or how Tess feels about Day or how jealous she is of Tess or how June misses Day just doesn't make a good story for me. I finally found myself looking for other things to do rather than picking up the book to read. That's a bad sign so I decided it was time to put this one down and move on to something else.Such a disappointment because the action of the first book of the series was sorely missing from this one. I guess if romance is your thing you might like this one.
