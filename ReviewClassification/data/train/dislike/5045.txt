I don't know why everyone went so wild over this book or this kid - is there one without the other? It seems like people only cared because it was aJon Krakauerbook that translated well to Hollywood. The guy in the book didn't even have enough material about himself to make a whole book and every other chapter is about some other person who did a similar "disappearance into nature." Dying because you don't know how to take care of yourself in the wild is no reason for society to glorify your life.
