Did you know that the letters in "Leaves of Grass" can be rearranged to spell "Asses of Gravel"?If you find yourself anagramming the letters in the title rather than reading the poetry, it's a good sign you're not into the book. But I really wanted some of whatever Whitman was smoking that made him so ecstatically, ebulliently enthusiastic about every molecule on the planet. Including his own b.o."The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer."Huh??? Was this guy sniffing glue along with those arm-pits?I made it through about 85 pages, then let it go. Maybe I'll come back to it in the future. There ARE some beautiful passages hiding in among all those exclamation marks.
