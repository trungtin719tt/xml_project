I'm not a big fan of PS I love you. Gerry is romantic and makes some wonderful gestures that make his wife realize she's not alone in dealing with life after Jerry. But thanks to these sweeping romantic gestures, they're out of money (nothing left even to pay utility bills) and Holly has to beg her Mom for money.PS: Take a splurgy vacation with your friends, then come back and make the most of the remaining $10 in our joint account!PPS I love you!
