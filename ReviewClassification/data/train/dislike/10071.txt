Horrible book, bored me to tears. Whine, whine, woe is me, whine. The protagonist is incredibly lazy, whine and empty headed. At one place in the book, she exclaims "but my vocabulary is about fifty words" - she nailed it. She has no interests, no hobbies, no job. She lived for her husband, and when he died, she lost everything, even his friends. So, she now mopes alone, thinking about that husband all the time. She "recollects" him, but really can't even describe what's she recollecting, so it always gets down to "his smell, his eyes, his smile". She is incredibly narcissistic and juvenile. For example, she goes to buy a newspaper, then want to buy some chocolate, but thinks that everyone is "looking at her" (why would they, what a diva!), so she tries to pick one bar from the lower shelf and spills the whole shelf on the floor. She picks it up and announces that the chocolate is for "the kids" and then picks up some chips and announces that the chips are for "the party she is throwing", because everyone would be judging her for eating that much chocolate and chips, if they knew they were for her. What the hell, who cares what she chews? Calls a club owner to arrange a karaoke singing and pretends to be her friend, because it's "embarrassing", and so on. Is she thirty or thirteen? Nothing much happens in that book, some random things, all interrupted by long whine about feeling and emotions, described with the same fifty words. I was so happy when I finished.
