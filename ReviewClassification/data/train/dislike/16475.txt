Wow, this is a dumb book.My main gripe here is that these characters are not cats. Despite the grumblings about twolegs etc, they really don't think like small, semi-social predators. These are humans in cat suits: little furry Magical Native Americans (tm), or at least someone's warped view thereof. It feels like it's trying to be Watership Down with cats, but seems to fail to realize the reason why Watership Down is so awesome is because the Watership rabbits are RABBITS: they're not human, they don't think like humans, they're their own unique culture underground and have uniquely lapine problems.It almost would have been better, or at least more honest, if the characters were anthros or something, but aside from being xenofiction that doesn't put enough thought into actually being xenofic, the main character is an insufferable little Marty Stu.So much wasted potential. Kitty xenofiction has been done and done much better. If you can find it, try out The Wild Road and compare and contrast.
