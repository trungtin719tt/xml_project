Guys I don't know if you know this but, um, this book has SO many pages. Rumour has it no one even knows how many.Imajica, whispers a spirit in one of the Four Dominions that isn't Earth. I could specify which, like Barker does, but it wouldn't matter because I would be unable to describe any of them any further, like Barker didn't.Interesting intro. Easy enough to follow. More characters were introduced and as I say once they entered these other Dominions that weren't Earth, and none of the Dominions were described, and Barker kept rambling about the Dominions' lore by bashing on his keyboard to come up with the name of some lord or potion or city or other, I was like... no.See if you read a book that's 1100 pages long, shouldn't it give you as much as 4 x 250 pg books or 3 x 400 pg books or 4 x 300 pg books? In a literary landscape that made sense, generally they would, but the only people to write books this long have given up reading anyone else's books because they're high on their own hype and forget how to type.Name me a single novel that ever needed to be this long?You're wrong.Now take the mild joy of my shit rhymes, stretch them to 100 pages (you see where I'm going.)
