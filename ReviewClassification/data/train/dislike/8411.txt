I just read a review of this book that says it has the worst grammar of any book ever published and that the editors should be ashamed.That is probably the real reason I continue to read this series. I would like to see how much worse it can get. I never thought I would read a more poorly written story than Jean Auel's The Shelters Of Stone, which read like a NaNoWriMo novel that never got fleshed out. But I was wrong. This series is full of annoying characters, half-baked plot ideas, and badly written prose.The librarian asked me if this was "one of those Twilight books" and although I turned up my nose as I said "no," I have to admit that the Twilight series is like Shakespeare compared to this.I can't wait to read this, knowing that it will--no pun intended--suck. This review is probably not helpful, considering I haven't read the book yet and I'll probably forget to update it when I'm done.Update: Boo. Hiss.
