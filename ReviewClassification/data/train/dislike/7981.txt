Ugghhhhhh. I've been trying to figure out where to start with this one for the past couple days and still haven't been able to decide. So I guess I'll start with my point.This book F*CKING BLOWS. F*ck you, Dan Brown, you smug bastard, for insulting my intelligence like nobody's business. I really liked Angels and Demons, was entertained by The Da Vinci Code, and this book had half the content (not to mention a sixteenth of the climax) of the latter in almost twice the number of pages.Do you get paid by the modifier? Or the number of hits of the term "secret wisdom"? BUY A GODDAMN THESAURUS. LEARN SOME NEW F*CKING VERBS. Do you ever get sick of writing the following dialogue?"But that can't possibly be true!""Why not Robert?""My sharp intellect and well-toned physique just won't let me believe it!"Seriously, every other f*cking chapter has that conversation, but with way more modifiers and whining, not to mention that it usually takes up a whole f*cking page.And the shit of it is, it's not even f*cking suspenseful. He literally just keeps you waiting. He doesn't even hide it anymore. The f*cker knows you're going to keep reading anyway, so why even bother to be creative with the cliffhangers?And the puzzles are even straightforward! Even though I don't hold a degree in Symbollogy (Yeah f*cking right. I still contend that he made that word up. Watch the f*cking Boondock Saints, Dan Brown.), a handful of them are completely obvious, and I swear he recycled at least one from Angels and Demons.And only one revelation in the whole book is remotely shocking. And I did see it coming. The rest of them are just inane letdowns. When I hear, "issue of national security," I think nukes-- not the pussy shit this guy is threatening.Deep breath.Moral of the story, please don't feed the author. And moral number two: if the back cover of a book contains solely "Critical Raves for Another Book," I should know better.
