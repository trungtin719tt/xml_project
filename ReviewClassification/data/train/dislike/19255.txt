I picked up this book thinking it would be a fun way to unwind from midterms, all snuggled up under my covers reading something that doesn't require that much thinking and is cute.Well I was wrong.The story is about two friends who have known each other their whole lives. The protagonist,Rachel,is a colorless, empty of any trace of personality sorry excuse of a woman and the best friend,Darcy, is a high-school movie bitch, meaning she's gorgeous, rich and selfish.The base of the story is that Rachel sleeps with Darcy's fiance and then tries to find an excuse for herself saying that Darcy was always kind of a bitch to her, getting the same backpack with her in elementary school and looking better in a black bikini, and anyway she saw the guy first!It seems to me that the writer wanted us to hate darcy a little too desperately.Conclusion :What a complete waste of time. this book is horrible. stay away!
