I TOTALLY NEED TO VENT AT THE STUPIDITY/IDIOCY/AND OBVIOUS MENTAL ISSUES OF THE MAIN CHARACTER.OK, honestly, what type of reaction would you expect from someone who used to be your boyfriend and CAUGHT you in the action of not only making out with someone, but down right naked in a freakin room at school doing the freak nasty to a teacher. LIKE REALLY, HAVE YOU NO SHAME OR BRAINS. THUS, THIS STUPID PARAGRAPH GETS ON MY NERVES.'Erik looked at me. His blue eyes were absolutely expressionless, which felt completely wrong. Those same eyes had shown me happiness and passion and warmth and even the beginnings of love. Then they'd shown me hurt and anger. And now they showed me nothing at all? How could that even be possible?'Um Zoey, its possible ur a ____.And thus for now, at this part, im rating this book a solid 1.AND this book will strike all time lows if Eric somehow forgives her and gets back with Zoey again. Cause that is utterly unrealistic and impossible. Eriks cruel attitude toward Zoey better keep up since this makes me actually like him as a character in this lame book for as before i was wondering and tbh still wondering why he's in this book at all.UPDATE: THIS GIRL TAKES BEING A ** TO A WHOLE NOTHER LEVEL. Tell me how she cheats and makes out with her ex-boyfriend, while in a relationship with another boy, and despite that manages to have sex with a teacher all in the same 2 month time span. THEN, IF THAT WASNT THE WORST OF IT. 2 days after her lover teacher died, she didnt hesitate and give herself time to recover. She lays a big one on a random boy who was in the process of DYING. WTH. this book is steadily getting on my last nerves.
