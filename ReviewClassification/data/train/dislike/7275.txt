A bizarre plot with a terrible beginning. Without any sort of background we are plunged into action. It works for Riordan but unfortunately not here. Could not bring myself to read past the first 20 pages.P.S - Mr. Patterson? Kids do NOT speak like that. You just sound like an adult trying too hard to talk in a way hethinkskids these days might talk.Bad sentence formation just now, you say? Yeah, that about sums up your book.
