Okay....I have to drag my soap box out...er sckrrrkk (keep in mind this is my opinion and I don't wish to offend anyone). Alright, I began to read junior fiction and young adult books to cut out the undesirable sex scenes and vulgar language. Well, I have had to stop reading highly entertaining young adult books because of the sex and language. I am highly disappointed in the trend now-a-days. Is it any wonder teen pregnancy is a problem, as well as substance abuse and vulgar language, if this kind of crap is being placed in these books? Shame on these authors for putting this kind of stuff in their "young adult" books - if you've got to be dirty, write for a sleazy paperback company instead of slipping your loose morals into books that are allegedly for young adults. If you want a clean cut book about vampires...don't read this book. If you're 18 or younger, don't read this book. I've stepped down from my box and wish you a good day.
