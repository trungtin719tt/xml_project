??????I don't understand the rave reviews. How is this a good story? Was Rachael supposed to be the one I was rooting for in this scenario? 'Cause I didn't like her.She was BORING. Rachael was a whiner who played it safe, then blamed her friend for all of the things that she didn't have. Yes, Darcy was a self-centered friend. So what?! If you don't like the way she treats you...stop returning her calls!And Dex? Ugh. He was a cheater. C-H-E-A-T-E-R! There is no other way to put it. I can understand howifthey had always felt something for each other, that they could have fallen into one others' arms in the heat of the moment. That's forgivable. Carrying on an affair formonthsbefore Darcy and Dex's wedding? Really? Why didn't Dex just call off the wedding as soon as he knew it wasn't just a drunken one night stand? How could he continue to live with Darcy, and see herbest friendon the side?! What an enormous asshole!Ok. In fairness, it turned out that Darcy was also cheating on him with a guy that Rachael had had a few dates with, but that doesn't make what Dex and Rachael did right. I couldn't muster up any sympathy for either of them. I honestly thought Rachael would have been better off without him, but at the same time I kind of thought that theydeservedeach other.Maybe I wasn't supposed to like them? Maybe the point of the story was that nobody is perfect? That life and love is messy? *shrugs* Ok. Awesome. Maybe I just don't get chick-lit?
