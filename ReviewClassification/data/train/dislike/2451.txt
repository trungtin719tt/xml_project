In honor of Dr. Seuss' birthday I post an annual review of one of his works. Normally they fart sunshine and rainbows, but today we're going to spend a minute with the book that makes me want to . . . .I know this is a classic and it's Seuss and no one is supposed to blaspheme when it comes to his good name, but come on. Two kids who are stupid enough to let a creepy effing CAT in their house only to nearly demolish the place obviously are not mature enough to be left home alone on a rainy day. I know, I know, it's just a "cute" story, but sometimes you gotta call out theridiculous. Right, Ron????Anyfarts, happy Read Across America Day! Read this to your kids. They'll love it.
