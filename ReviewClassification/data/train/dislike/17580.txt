I'm not sure there has ever been a point to any of this, but this one seemed to lose any sign of cohesive narration toward the end. Again, it ended abruptly &amp; on a cliff hanger. Still kind of funny at odd moments, but so pointless as to be tiring. I thought I'd try one more &amp; queued it up, but then found some better books at the library. I think I've spent enough time on this series. I now get many of the references FWIW. Ugh. Next I'll be watching football or some other ridiculous sport that spends millions of dollars moving a ball around a field in an effort to speak to &amp; understand those around me. Hah! No, just kidding. There are far too many better things to do.
