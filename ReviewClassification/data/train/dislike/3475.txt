See the chapter x chapter breakdown on my blogAs if the simplistic and "tell-y" writing in this book weren't bad enough, we also have to content with some truly atrocious pacing, inconsistent characterization, logic gaps out the wazoo, a Gary Stu of a main character, and an ending that kicks this book up into whole new levels of WTFery.The majority of this book is people jealously withholding information that gets revealed a few chapters later, which makes it painfully obvious that all the not-telling going on is just for the sake of dragging things out. The "puzzle" of the maze should have been solved in the first week (or at least, parts of it should), the "monsters" were so easy to beat that I'mstillconfused as to why the boys didn't kill them all sooner, and Thomas got way too much praise for merely existing. The rest of the cast had to be dumbed down to some truly paint-eating levels in order to make him look good, but the book went ahead and did that. (At one point, Thomas was actually praised for his "brilliant" tactic for getting around the monsters, which consisted of "fake right, dodge left." Toddlers can figure that one out.)And I really have no words for that ending except: no one involved in this project should be allowed anywhere near an environmental debate. Clearly, too many lessons facts about how the planet works need to be re-taught first.To cap off the fail-cake that is this book, we also got the lovely message of "if anyone disagrees with you and gets angry about it, call them insane. Once they're declared insane, it's perfectly okay to ignore every single thing they say, because as we all know, insane people cannot ever say a true thing; they just spout off nonsense 24/7 are are good for absolutely nothing."
