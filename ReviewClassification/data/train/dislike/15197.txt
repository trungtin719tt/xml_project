Remy is a girl who thinks that she has this whole love thing figured out, whenever she feels that the relationship might take a step up, she dumps the guy. All that changes when she meets Dexter, a guy who says that the first time he saw her, he knew they were meant to be together. To top it all off, Dexter is a musician, an occupation Remy does not like because her father was one and only left her with one legacy, a one hit wonder called, "this lullaby".This book had a decent amount of faults. I did not care for the main character, she didn't seem to learn from her mistakes and the way she used guys in her relationships, only staying with them until she thought things were getting to serious and then unmercifully dumping them for the next guy, only made me dislike her more. I did not like Dexter, I couldn't see how he managed to be in a band with the way he acted and how he couldn't seem to keep track of important things like the electricity bill. There were a couple moments of sweetness, but not nearly enough to redeem this novel. Language was a bit of a problem as well, but upon reading more and more Sarah Dessen, it seems that she has no problem with adding words here and there. I would not recommend this book to my friends, it was entirely lacking the good qualities that I had expected.*Taken from my book reviews blog:http://reviewsatmse.blogspot.com/2008...
