poke me in the eye! This book is terrible! The first one was forgiven for it's rambling irrelevancies due to it's imaginative world and logical magic. This one has no excuses. First off, it's about as entertaining as watching a clock's hour hand tick. Second, approximately two things happen in the entire book that are even important! Each event can go beyond being summed up in a chapter or two. This was riddled with rambling text, inconsistencies, and fluff. A wonderful example of it's dull droning takes place while Eragon is eating fruit with his teacher. As the two are staring at each other for a good few paragraphs we get a lovely description of a scintillating hummingbird that floats out of the trees and licks up a bit of fruit juice. What the heck! Who cares! Why would anyone wast any effort on such mind numbingly boring text? Terrible read.
