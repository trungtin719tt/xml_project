DNF @ 50%I know, I know. I'm a peabrain pleb and this is truly a classic andhow dare I?I understand what it's trying to do. I understand the over-enthusiasm for science and the depersonalization. I understand how showing a thriving world devoid of relationships and emotions feels counterintuitive and wrong. ('That's the point!'I understand that's the part that's supposed to'make you think!') I understand how the conditioning and predestination of this "utopia" sacrifices individuality for compliance and just whoaaaaI even understand that the frickin orgies and the special drug ("Soma") are representative of the way the people shed their own identities and continue to live a unified existence.I understand how ground-breaking this was.I understand it raises all sorts of questions and opens discussions about free will, societal control, the role of government andwhat humanity is.But it's not for me. This is incredibly dense as theentirefirst half has been dedicated to showing the science and structure of this 'brave new world.' There's not really a plot and there's not really even characters? (I meankinda?) It all feels dedicated to driving the same few points home.I understand. But I'm bored. And I'm tired of the shock-factor of orgies and children engaging in "erotic play"(This really could have been a short-story and it would have accomplished the same things)
