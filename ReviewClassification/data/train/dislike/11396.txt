The Zombie Room is about three guys who meet in prison, try to go straight, get involved in a little scam and stumble into a sex trafficking gang.The start of the book is highly enjoyable, but as more action is added in the second half the author occasionally failed to describe the scenes accurately and appropriately so that I was confused as to the layout of a scene, or how they are now on foot when previously driving. Tiny points but should have been picked up in the editing.(view spoiler)[The biggest problem for me though was the abrupt ending, I actually thought there was an issue with the ebook version as it just seems to stop with no real resolution. I know life doesn't have neat endings, but I want to know just a little more about the central characters post all the excitement and indeed, the baddies. Perhaps there is a follow up planed, but the Kindle version that I read via the Android app just stops.(hide spoiler)]
