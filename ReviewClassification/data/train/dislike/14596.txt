The Book, cough, cough:Called a novel, it's more a novella, barely over 170 pages--the better to save money on printing costs--set in large type on small pages. Set between a frame story (utterly forgettable) employed to give the reader a sense of being privy to a real event, voyeurism at it's best--one of my acquaintances actually tried to find the characters from the novel in the real world using the Internet, convinced Waller could never have made the story up. She was half right: Waller didn't make up the story, he just changed the details in a story old as time (how old is time, anyway?), like changing the colors in a paint by number.The Oh-So Complicated Plot:First, if you're going to read this book, don't. Second, if you aren't going to listen to me, skip this part and read on to find out more about why you shouldn't read this book. Francesca is a bored housewife married to Richard (forget him--Waller does) who has an affair with a new and exciting photographer (How do we know? He carries a Nikon and snaps pictures) called Robert Kincaid. Note: not Robert, but Robert Kincaid, like James, James Bond; for the slow reader, two names means he's different. The two adulterers fall in love. But then instead of going off with the exciting man, Frannie, as her unexciting husband calls her, decides to stay because of her "responsibilities." Later she regrets it and finds out Robert never loves again. Why? Because it's more romantic that the knight goes off and dies of unrequited love than settles down with the damsel and becomes the unexciting husband of everyday life.Fiction Writing 101:I found this book good for only one thing: as an excellent primer for those who want to become writers themselves. Just look at these valuable lessons I learned.1. Characterization-Uh, I got this character who I want to be different. Hmm, well I gave him two names and I made him a photographer (by making him carry a Nikon and snap some pictures). I guess I should describe him in some different way, too. What about calling him a "dead-end branch of evolution." Now, that's description. I'll just repeat that one phrase over and over and over. Wait maybe I'll throw in something really original like the "last cowboy." Oh man, that's hot stuff.2. How to simplify a morally ambiguous issue:Excuse what your character does and have the other characters accept it; that way your reader doesn't have to do any thinking and doesn't get confused over how they should feel about the character. Francesca to her children on her affair: "If you love me, then you must love what I have done." Mom, I killed my brother but if you love me, then you must love what I have done. Waller told me so.3. Theme-Make astonishing philosophical statements by asserting bland generalizations about the sexes: "In a way, women were asking for men to be poets and driving, passionate lovers at the same time. Women saw no contradiction in that. Men did." Now, that's brilliant, what in-depth analysis of the complex way women and men view each other.
