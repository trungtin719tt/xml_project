This book has the worst grammar of any published novel I have ever read. Whoever edited this should be ashamed. Besides that, the authors do write a story that is fairly interesting. Authors are pretty good, but the editors can't possibly speak English.Down points of the novel are that every guy is described as being exactly the same. They're all perfectly gorgeous without a flaw or even different personalities. The homosexual characters are flat stereotypes. And, having a young adult book in which a teenage character makes out with a teacher is just plain wrong. The incident is described as being exciting and not bad at all. Huh? Why encourage pedophilia? The story didn't need this twist as the lead character is already dating several different guys at the same time. Why not put forth a stronger female character who puts her time into a healthy relationship?Could've been much better without the ridiculous relationship with a teacher, some editing, and better character development. The plot itself holds the reader's interest despite these flaws.
