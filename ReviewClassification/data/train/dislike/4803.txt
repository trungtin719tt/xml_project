I only wish there were a star less than one. I wish I could remove stars. I wish there were a star deficit rating.This book almost made me give up reading all together. It is definitely the last book I trusted from Oprah. I still think she owes me money and those days of my life back.It was page after page of the most depressing writing I've ever read with absolutely no pay off.
