I actually was glancing through a book shop and when suddenly this book caught my attention. I 've previously read The Alchemist and i thoroughly enjoyed it. But veronica was pretty awesome. In a sense, it was the truth of the western world and will be applicable to the eastern world which is actually involved all the time in copying the west. And from a very depressed state, with no great ambitions or desire in everyday life, veronica decides that life is not worthy of living and after a failed attempt to end her life, she wakes up in a totally unexpected place, the home of the mentally depressed. And she finds the anger, desire, hope and above all love in that place.I could not but admire the skillful way in which the story is narrated and i really really have become a big fan of paulo coelho. The story is complicated and simply, paradoxical and inspirational..The character of Edward is still making me admire the novel and actually it took 3 and a half hours for me to finish the novel standing the book shop itself, as i am not so rich to possess a copy of it.It is a transformation from irritation to hope, from disgust to pleasure. Please guys read it. and those who feel very down (after a broken relationship or something) , try reading this, it'll reveal you the uncertainity of life.you never really know what's up to you in the future...Read it. It's as pacy as a shoaib akhtar delivery and as interesting as a spielberg movie.But you always get one thing on extra which you don't get in ss movie or sa delivery,that's what i call and still admire the novel for"LIFE"
