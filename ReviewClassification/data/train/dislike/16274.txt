The Taming of the Shrew, abridged.PETRUCHIO: Hey Mr Minola, I wanna marry your daughter. The fact that she comes included with an awesome dowry has nothing to do with this.BAPTISTA: Oh, I'm sorry, I have this jackass rule that my daughter Bianca can't get married until her evil older sister does, so...PETRUCHIO: No, I want to marry the Kate chick. My friends tell me she's a ballbusting bitch - a "shrew", if you will - and I love a challenge.BAPTISTA: SOLD! to the rich guy with a death wish. Have fun, kids! *runs*PETRUCHIO: 'Sup, baby?KATE: FUCK YOU STRAIGHT TO HELL, DICKSHIT!PETRUCHIO: Aww. Who's a cute widdle feminist? Yes you are! Yes you - OW! Jesus Christ, you bit me!KATE: *foams at mouth*PETRUCHIO: Damn, this might take a few days.GREMIO: I want to marry Bianca!HORTENSIO: No, I want to marry Bianca!LUCENTIO: Too bad, losers! I'M going to marry Bianca, and for some reason I've decided that the best way to woo her is to disguise myself as a tutor.HORTENSIO: YOU STOLE MY IDEA!BIANCA: Mwahahaha! Dance, puppets, dance!HORTENSIO AND LUCENTIO: *dance*BAPTISTA: So, somehow everything turned out okay! Lucentio married Bianca in secret without my permission, which I'm totally okay with, and even Hortensio found a widow to be his rebound wife -WIDOW: Hi, I'm rich and horny!BAPTISTA: - and Gremio didn't get anyone, but he's old so we don't care, and even Petruchio was able to tame my daughter!PETRUCHIO: Sure - if by "tame" you mean "utterly break her spirit using methods that are now being employed by guards at Guantanamo", but sure, whatever works.BAPTISTA: So really, everyone wins.KATE: Hi honey! I just finished ironing your shirts and then I realized it's been over five minutes since I told you how awesome you are! You're the bestest husband ever! Gee, if only women could be as great as men!EVERYONE: Awwww.THE END.
