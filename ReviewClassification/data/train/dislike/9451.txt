I'm not impressed with this book at all. As a novel, it fails to entertain. As a manifesto, it is too vague and shallow to enact any meaning. What frustrated me most was Quinn's lack of proof to substantiate his scientific rhetoric and his cut &amp; paste techniques when addressing religion.What Quinn fails to recognize is that humans need more than just food. "Man cannot live by bread alone." If we returned to "Leaver" status and were fulfilled with natural-growing sustenance, man would still be restless. If, as Ishmael purports, that feeding ourselves would only take 2-3 hours a day, and we'd have the rest of the day to do whatever, we would not be content to laze around all day. They would do something with their time. They would need something to give their lives meaning. That's a key component of humanity that Quinn's novel fails to address. Humans are different from other animals because in that they are existential and meta-cognitive beings. Humans need something to give their lives purpose. Quinn shows an obvious lack of knowledge in many of the fields of study he pulls from to fill this book, including creative writing. It seems to me that the author had a hard time getting his academic work published, and decided to write a "novel" with a talking ape. He sensationalized what was otherwise shoddy academic writing and was able to sell it.While this book made me think, I cringe when I see others take his arguments about religion, food production, and population control seriously.
