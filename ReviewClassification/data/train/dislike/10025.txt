AUGUST 16, 2013: THIS IS GONNA BE ONE RANTING REVIEW COMING RIGHT UP.(My before-read review of this book is BELOW my after-read review, so scroll down to look there, if you'd like. ^-^)AUGUST 19, 2013:SPOILERS. This book is full of freaking spoilers. SPOILERS EVERYWHERE. SPOILER. SPOILER. SPOILER HERE AND THERE AND EVERYWHERE. IN THE AIR. I DON'T CARE. I HAVE HAIR. I LIKE BEARS--I dunno, that could be a new song. :D....But seriously, this review is full of spoilers.I.HATED.THIS.PIECE.OF.(*salgangasidlgfhgadsflaihgksdfasdsdf)This is going to be a full on rant. And some of you might think I'm crazy, or way too picky, or an "angry person whose head explodes like a volcano just from reading a book", but AYE. DON. CARE. AYE DON CARE. (Get it?)I read the author's about me and acknowledgements. She seems COOL. She has spunk, she's out there, she's just . . . SPUNKY! And I love spunky.But this lady, who's spunk I admire, happened to write a book that I can sayIS ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ. EVER.And no. I've never read Twilight by Stephanie Meyer. I wasunfortunate enough to read Blue Moon by Alyson Noel, which was a big load of doodoo, and this book and that one TIE UP PERFECTLY IN HORRIBLENESS.Welcome to the fo-shizzle shelf, you misfitted book.So if you're a fellow review reader who LOVED this book, you're probably sitting there thinking, "Wow. Theresa's review for today is gonna suck because I TOTALLY DISAGREE, THIS BOOK IS AH-MAY-ZING." and that's okay!But you can never get me to ever think this book was gem. It was "bloody awful". Compared to a gem, this book was merely loose change, and I'm really, really disappointed.REASONS THIS BOOK EARNED THAT ONE SPARKLY STAR:Because it wasn't a "zero-star" book, it was a ONE STAR. It earned that one star. Why?Because in my opinion, this writing is really, really not that bad. THE WRITING, not the story. The story . . . . well, we'll get on to that in a second.But the WRITING was okay. It wasn't overly detailed, like"My mouth slowly turned into a curl as I gently pressed the greasy keys of my computer's keyboard. I sighed and tediously fluffed my hair as I typed, 'My mouth slowly turned into a curl as I gently pressed the greasy keys . . .'"IT WASN'T LIKE THAT. It had a pretty good flow going. So WHAT THE HECK HAPPENED???!!(*Ahem) Well, I should mention this one really whacko sentence that made me sort of snort. I don't know what page it was on. But America was describing Maxon, and she said, and I quote:"He launched himself into a run."....He launched himself. He LAUNCHED himself. Not to tease or taunt but that sentence made me picture him with rockets under his shoes like Astro Boy.Reasons why this book flew across the room(as in . . . . . I chucked it. FOR REAL.)1. Love triangle.This was the worst . . . the worst love triangle ever. Even worse than the human-vampire-werewolf one that I assume everyone knows. It was. THE WORST.And I'm not trying to be mean when I say worst, but it just made me so angry and frustrated.America Singer was emitted into the Selection to compete for a guy.Prince Maxon Shubalubadoo (forgot his last name but remembered it started with an S) is the prince.Aspen is the first boyfriend of America.AFTER TWO GUYS AT A TIME?! America, you horndog.NO! NO NO NO MAXON IS THE HORNDOG HERE. (But I will get to that in a second.)But get this.In book one, Aspen freaking breaks up with America because America is in caste 5, and he's a caste lower than she is, so that would only bring her down. AND because she's going to the Selection for the prince.That is effing stupid. YOU DON'T JUST GIVE UP THE GIRL YOU LOVE FOR THAT! Just because she's going to the Selection?! 35 freaking girls, THERE'S A CHANCE SHE WON'T WIN! It just made me so mad how he could give her up like that.Then this (sasjflasijgadfslsadf) shows up at the castle as a guard. TO MADE THE BOOK MORE DRAMATIC, OOH. LA. LA.But apparently this guy still. loves. America. SO WHY DID YOU LET HER GO IN THE FIRST PLACE, YOU TURD?!Maxon. In the first book, I thought he was alright. But then I realized why I do not like "The Bachelor" the show.It's like he's dating a bunch of girls at once! He could be kissing all of them! He goes and tells America "I will choose you, I will choose you. ONLY IF YOU WANT ME TO CHOOSE YOU, my dear!"Hah. Let's just read and see what he REALLY does.You see, I didn't mind Maxon for a while . . . until he literally started crushing on one of the other girls. (JEEZ, I hope I didn't spoil anyone there . . .) YOU LIED TO AMERICA, you turd-in-a-bucket. YOU. LIED.TO. HER.HOW. DARE. YOU!!!!Even though I think America is . . .. . . a pretty big ditz, I STILL HATE HOW HE CHANGED HIS MIND LIKE THIS. He didn't keep his word. He didn't. Keep. His. Word. "Oh, my dear America, I only want you!"That's not a good example of a lover! WHAT THE HECK?!It would have made more sense if America noticed that and used it as a factor of elimination in her should-I-choose-Maxon-or-Aspen contest, but America didn't notice a thing. She was stupid enough to still keep him in the running for her HERO.Through the book I was BEGGING this girl to just see Maxon's B.S. YOU SHOULD BE WITH SOMEONE WHO ONLY WANTS YOU!Who only wants you? Maxon has to make a choice.LOOK AT FREAKING ASPEN! He's freaking waiting for you.You've been together for 2 years.YOU HAVE MEMORIES.To top that all off, you don't have to struggle with being a princess! (Which I should mention, in the story, America almost decides not to stay in The Selection because she thinks she's not fit for a princess. OH-KAY, FINE! Go to Aspen then! He's STANDING RIGHT--OVER--THERE!!! *rips hair off of head in pure and utter frustration.)I mean obviously she and Aspen still love each other, even though Aspen is still a dummy for dumping her in the first place. (This all wouldn't have happened if it weren't for you, Aspen. THANKS. THANKS A LOT.)I might just seem like one of those fangirls who are raging because I'm on "Team Aspen" or whatever. NO. I'M NOT ON ANY TEAM! I want to smack Aspen as much as I want to smack America and Maxon ALL TOGETHER.So 2. America was frustratingly, irritatingly, hair-pulling-out-ingly STUPID.What does this teach the reader, huh?That's what I think books are all about. THEIR LIFE LESSONS IN THE STORY.America is struggling between choosing a guy she's been in love with for 2 years and a prince who's "dating" 5 other girls besides her!WHICH ONE SHALL SHE CHOOSE!You know what?You know what? (*growls)Aspen, just go find another girl.There was this quote in this very book, I SWEAR, and I forgot what page it was on.But Aspen says to America something along the lines of:"I know I'm smart. Because I am smart enough not to fall for a stupid girl."Are you smart, Aspen? ARE YOU?REALLY?Hmm. I plead to concur!3. What kind of love lesson does this story teach?!The three of them are all practically cheating on each other.America. You are cheating on Aspen with Maxon.America. You are also cheating on Maxon with Aspen. (AND BEHIND HIS BACK! Oh my my my.)AMERICA. You alternate kissing one and the other through the pages. HOW DO YOU NOT FEEL THE GUILT INSIDE YOU!(Sorry, guys, I just really, really, really hate cheating. And I always feel uncomfortable when someone likes 2 people at once.DID YOU KNOW if you want 2 people, you actually want neither of them?LET ME EXPLAIN.Lets pretend you are choosing between PRINCE A and PRINCE B.Prince A doesn't have feelings for you. But Prince B does.So you tag along with Prince B and say "Okay! I'll just choose Prince B!" and you're all dandy and fine! UNLESS YOU LIKE PRINCE A BETTER THAN PRINCE B.If that is the case, you should say you like Prince A. Because nothing, I repeat NOTHING is crueller than dating a person when you like someone else more. NOTHING IS CRUELLER than making someone a "plan B" or a "Safety net in case you get dumped by the first guy".)So America likes both of these guys at the same time.HOW.I don't know how you can love two people EXACTLY THE SAME. There must be one of them that you love more, and you have to figure that out.BUT WHY WHY WHY DO YOU IGNORE HOW THEY TREAT YOU?! Why do you take so long to choose when it's obvious who you SHOULD choose: the guy you've been in love with LONGER or this newer guy you just met because of a COMPETITION that's also been dating 34 other girls? HUH?!HUH, AMERICA?!Or maybe . . . maybe it's the kind of story that follows after "You can't be in love with 2 guys. Because if you were really in love with the first guy, you wouldn't have fallen for the second."UGH. Confusing. So so confusing now.I dunno. I'm not capable of liking two people at once, because once I am really in love with someone, it's impossible to see anyone else that could possibly be better than him.That's what falling in love means, isn't it?So have you guys ever heard of the youtube series, "How It Should Have Ended". GO WATCH THEM. NOW!I'll freaking give a link to their channel!WATCH THESE!!The Selection: The Elite should be made into one of these.Because I'm not trying to rewrite the story or anything, but think of it like HISHEdotcom would.HOW THE SELECTION SHOULD HAVE ENDED:Aspen: "America . . . . America, I came all the way from (wherever we live) to see you . . . . to tell you how much I love you. I'm still here, baby . . . I'm still here. I still love you so much."America: "But . . . you dumped me."Aspen: "It was a mistake, America."America: "I've found someone new though."Aspen: "I would never choose anyone over you, America! NEVER!"Maxon: "I like you America. AND I like this one other girl, too, AT THE SAME TIME. Just like how you like that lonely guard over there AND ME at the same time! Perhaps you deserve that!" *wink wink*America: "Wait a minute . . . . Maxon, you told me you only wanted me."Maxon: "It's a competition! ANYTHING CAN HAPPEN! It's like the Bachelor, REMEMBER?"America: "Oh . . . that's right."Maxon: "Besides, you're not the only girl I've kissed, you know."Aspen: "You're the only girl I've kissed America! I love you! Come back with me! Let's be together, I CAME ALL THIS WAY. JUST FOR YOU. I AM HERE FOR YOU!"Maxon: "You'll have a chance at my kingdom if you stay with me."America: " . . . Wait a minute. This is a love story. It's supposed to teach the readers SOMETHING ABOUT LOVE. Love doesn't care about kingdoms. Love doesn't care about being the highest caste, or being princess, or marrying a beautiful prince. Love is about being there for someone, someone being there for you. Love is about ONE OTHER PERSON that makes you feel like your heart is going to burst--JUST ONE OTHER PERSON. Love shouldn't have to compete. Love should be solid and obvious. Aspen, you and I have loved each other for so long. Maxon, I don't have that history with you, and besides, you like someone else. How can you truly love me . . . if you love someone else at the same time? Aspen . . . I realize who really loves me."Aspen: "Really?"America: "I choose you Aspen! Let us have a happy ending together! SPARE THE READERS A BOOK #3!!"(Aspen and America flip off Maxon together, and then they link arms and skip into the sunset.)OR it can happen like this:ALTERNATE ENDINGAspen: " . . . I'M HERE FOR YOU!"Maxon: "You'll have a chance at my kingdom if you stay with me."America: "Wait a minute . . . this is a love story. It's supposed to teach the readers something about LOVE . . . . . . . . . Aspen, you dumped me for a stupid reason! Maxon, you like another girl at the same time as me! None of you truly treat me like a princess! I'll find another prince ON. MY. OWN!"(America flips off both Aspen and Maxon and then skips off into the sunset to find a better prince charming to TRULY LOVE HER, unlike these two idiots.)So yeah.As for the 3rd book, I don't think I'm touching it. If I do end up touching it, just to see who she ends up with . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . no, I don't think so.THE ONLY PART I LIKED IN THIS BOOK were the quotes on page 62.AND I only liked the side characters, Marlee and Carter. THEIR LOVE STORY seems more amazing than America's and Aspen's and Maxon's.MAKE A STORY ABOUT THEM INSTEAD!-----------------BEFORE THE BOOK WAS READ-----------------BEFORE ZE BOOK HAS BEEN OPENED (As of July 14, 2012)So while reading The Selection, I was on a ninja's mission for originality and a smile, and after I finished the Selection, I noticed that . . . my mission is not done yet!No. The story isn't over yet.I'm DETERMINED TO FIND A SMILE IN THIS INSTALLMENT. If I don't . . . heads will roll.Oh yes. Another book that will be released after the world ends.
