I'm really not a fan of good ol' Richard Dawkins, not just as a writer but also as a person. It is possible to not believe in god without mocking religious people. I have friends who are Muslim, and they find 9/11 a horrible event that doesn't represent the fundamentals of Islam in the least. I have Christian friends who don't force their beliefs on others and who aren't prejudiced at all towards other races or the LGBTQ+ community. To ridicule all religious people as deluded morons is wrong in my view and this book is a slap in the face of the freedom and reason that atheism stands for.
