I liked the story, but the characters felt a little lacking to me. I was hoping for more when it came to the detective side of the story. Now, was it just me or does the title of the book not match the story completely? There was a tree, things happened by or near that tree, but enough to make it the title? It gave me the illusion that this story was leading me somewhere else and in the end I believe this was the reason this story fell short of being memorable.
