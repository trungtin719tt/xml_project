I seem to be one of very few who didn't like this book. First of all I must point out that I love girlie books and cry at anything even the slightest bit sad. With that said, I didn't enjoy it at all and couldn't wait for it to end. I WANTED to like it. I hoped something would happen to make me change my opinion but it didn't.The whole book felt like a rambling and dull conversation with a repetitive yet inconsistent story-line. I would normally have full sympathy for Holly's situation but honestly she just annoyed me. Her friends annoyed me. Her family (except her mum, I liked her) annoyed me. And the notes from Gerry... what a sweet, romantic idea but I didn't get that from them at all. Even they lacked any realism or real emotion for me.I'm glad it's over. A BIG thumbs down for me.
