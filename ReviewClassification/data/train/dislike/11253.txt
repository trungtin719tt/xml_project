uuuugh i hated this book!!!!!! BUT before i start trashing it, i'll say that there is one thing i liked about it - the author's ability to give two completely different viewpoints and make the reader understand and empathize with them both. all i'll say about the plot is that it's about two people fighting for the ownership of a bungalow (that in itself should have stopped me from picking up this book - boringgggggg). i found myself rooting for each character at different times, for which i give credit to the author. but when i look at the book as whole, i absolutely hated it! first, the characters were put in the most absurd and unrealistic situations, the whole book was soooo unbelievable, i literally had to force myself to finish it. it was really a struggle for me to keep reading, i was so uninterested in the book, the only driving force was my curiosity to find out how the house dispute is resolved. needless to say, the end is so pathetic - but the whole book was a disappointment so i guess i shouldn't have gotten my hopes up. i am planning on seeing the movie tho, just to compare it to the book. as for recommendations, i emphatically DON'T recommend it to anyone, i found it too boring! but if you do read it or have read it before, i'd like to know what you thought.
