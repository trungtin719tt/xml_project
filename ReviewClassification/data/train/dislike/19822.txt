Perhaps I've been spoilt growing up by too many political sex scandals sinking careers in waves of laughter so I always felt that sale of the titular character's wife in order to buy Fermenty and even more the revelation of this secret later in the novel should have much more power and impact than they do. Instead I suppose it is not the tragedy of a stupid action but the tragedy of a more generally stupid hubris of the man who believes he can do what he wants and get away with it (including selling wife number one in order to have some mildly alcoholic refreshment). The small town setting of a fictionalised Dorchester is good, hard alongside the remnants of the Roman town - the past is inescapable, it is just that when it grabs you by the collar it is more like Eamonn Andrews with his red book than the grim visage of Nemesis. Stock energetic Scotsman on his way to make his fortune in the colonies gives it a painting by numbers feel. Hardy in his way is more a Rembrandt in his style than one of the fine painters who is careful about every detail. Instead there is absolute concentration on his central theme while the rest can be sketched in or populated by stock figures.
