You know what? I give up! I've been reading this for over two months and every time I picked it up I was so bored and confused. Maybe one day I'll go back and read it in a shorter time span, but idk. The writing was gorgeous and the metaphors were nice, but I couldn't connect to the story at all, there wasn't enough of the unicorn, and it was just strange.It had this quality to it that was like The Little Prince where there seems like there will be some deeper, darker message concealed with a lot of symbolism and loaded language, but I couldn't quite place what it was trying to do. I was just so, so bored, which upsets me because I paid full price for this book, and it has such high ratings.
