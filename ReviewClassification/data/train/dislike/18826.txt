This book is completely twee and unoriginal, and I am a little embarrassed to be reading it. It's the literary equivalent of eating a whole box of cookies -- but not even good cookies, more like Snackwell's. Mediocre and unsatisfying.(And yet I am reading it anyway.)Now that I've finished it, I can say definitively that the barrage of five-star reviews for this book kind of makes me lose my faith in humanity. Even if you like this kind of writing, it is so clearly a wholesale ripoff of "Practical Magic" (not exactly a literary classic to start with) that I am astonished anyone was willing to publish it.I'm going to just go ahead and forget that any of this ever happened.
