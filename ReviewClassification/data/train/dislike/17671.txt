Ever one-ups herself in this one, proving to be the dumbest fictional character of all time.How anyone can read this and walk away happy is beyond me. Seriously, the girl is dumb, the plot limp, the characters even more haphazard than they were the first time around. It's the literary equivalent of smacking your head into a brick wall over and over again. Although, I think that would ultimately be more enjoyable and less damaging.I can't even count how many times I was trying to mentally will the characters into being interesting and smart, but they never failed to disappoint. This is one of the worst books I've ever read....and I've read all four installments of the Twilight Saga.Stephenie Meyer really likes it when her characters shudder....do you know what Alyson Noel likes her characters to do? Shrug. A LOT. Even when they're not "shrugging", they're "lifting their shoulders".Someone please buy Alyson Noel a dictionary, a thesaurus, and perhaps a book on human body language. She would benefit.
