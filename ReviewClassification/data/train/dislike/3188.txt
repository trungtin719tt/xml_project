Did you know the author tortured &amp; sexually assaulted her own children, helped &amp; encouraged her pedophile (ex)husband, and advocated for adult/child sexual relationships...because both she and her hubby participated in them?Here's a good jumping-in point:Her Daughter:https://www.theguardian.com/books/201...Her Son:http://starfire-studio.com/markgreyla...I didn't like this novel before -- too much misandry, revisionism, contempt for the Arthurian mythos, creepy sexual content, etc. etc. But knowing such information about the author -- who she REALLY was and what she did and what she thought -- explains a lot about certain themes, scenes, etc. in this book that always put me off.
