This book is EVERYTHING I LOATHE about children's fables. I'll write a better review later because right now I'm itching to punch Bach!****Review****Once upon a time there was a seagull and all he wanted to do was fly - fast, high, rolling dives.....Don't bother me, I just want to FLY, B*tchesOkay... whatever.... you want to fly, birdy, I get it! However, you alsoNEEDto eat, you know, to survive and all!! The flock steps in on JLS and tells him he needs to stop fluttering about like an idiot and accept reality.... and he's all:(Only significantly less awesome, because Adam Levine is......SMEXY)Honestly, I'm not a religi-hater I just can't stand force feeding children bullsh*t that makes no sense! If you don't eat, children, you will not become the most amazing flier in the world!!! You will just, wait for it........It's good and important to have dreams, kids, but so is responsibility!
