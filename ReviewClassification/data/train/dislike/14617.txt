The Wedding almost seemed like it was specifically written for me to hate - and it's been a long time since I've disliked a book this much. There's no real art to it (people are "white as paper" and so forth), but it's written for people who don't exactly have alternative lifestyles or world views. The baby boomer housewife married her husband because he respected her desire to be a housewife at a time when "most people our age wanted to change the world," and she knew he'd be a good provider. As someone who eloped (and really upset her mother), I flinched when the wife freaked out just because her daughter wanted a small wedding (and says she would be horrified if her daughter had eloped).The entire book is devoted to wedding plans - the narrator will say something like "I spent the afternoon in my den making calls for the wedding" and then DETAIL them (called the sheetrock guy, who said...called the gardener, who said...). These are conversations that bore me in real life, so why would I want to read them in a book I'm ostensibly reading for pleasure???And it is so over-the-top - the daughter asks her mom to be her matron of honor, and then there's a twist at the end that is impossible to believe would ever happen. Still, there are folks that will love this book despite its sappiness, and I don't want to rain on their parade more than I already have.
