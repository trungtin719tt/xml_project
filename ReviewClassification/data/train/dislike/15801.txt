Found this file I started on my computer June 9, 2007:Hypertext Reading of Naked LunchReadingNaked Lunchas it was intended: open the book at any page and just read what is there. Keeping track of pages read, so that there is no duplication and each page is given its consideration. Am a bit anal about these things, so I'm not going to cut in the middle of a chapter...going to read nearest chapter from where I pry open the book. The book is never meant to end, because it's an immortal junky's nightmare. Read, read, read and then, finally, the ultimate nightmare: ultimate boredom with horrors. Purgatory in a carnival funhouse, and the electricity's been cut off.1. The Black Meat (pgs. 47-51)2. Interzone (pgs.161-168)3. Have You Seen Pantopon Rose (pgs. 179-181)4. Quick...
