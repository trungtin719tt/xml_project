Please note: Read in 2007 from an on-line edition for personal research and edification. Reactions to it are my own.Annotated Synopsis: Described by Nietzsche himself as "the deepest ever written", the book is a dense and esoteric treatise on philosophy and morality, featuring as protagonist a fictionalized Zarathustra. A central irony of the text is that Nietzsche mimics the style of the Bible in order to present ideas which fundamentally oppose Christian and Jewish morality and tradition.The original text contains a great deal of word-play. An example of this exists in the use of the words "over" or "super" and the words "down" or "abyss/abysmal"; some examples include "superman" or "overman", "overgoing", "downgoing" and "self-overcoming".My Thoughts: Nietzsche espouses a desire to create Supermen, who will be superior to modern humans. He vilifies pity, charity, and sympathy as being weak, and glorifies the warrior and those who would be cruel to create strength in themselves and others ("cruel to be kind" I suppose you could say). His character Zarathustra speaks in a stilted, medieval way which, I suppose, is supposed to call to mind biblical passages.While I accept the importance of this work as philosophy and classic literature, I have to mark it as 2 stars because I felt this was, to a great extent, the philosophy espoused by Nazi Germany - at any rate, I could see where this formed part of the backbone of their society as developed and enforced by Hitler and his party.I did not really enjoy reading it, although I feel it is important to read as many and as varied works as possible in order that I might learn something new all the time. Read it as a classical work, and as a philosophical masterpiece, but if you are troubled by the history of the Nazis and/or Fascism, you will likely find the ideals espoused in this text to be uncomfortable.
