Gilbert points out that each country she visits begins with "I", so her journey is really a journey to the self, blah blah blah. But the whiff of narcissism in the "I I I" pattern is no whiff. It's a hurricane. Who brings copies of her OWN BOOKS to her psychiatrist, 'cause she wants him to HELP her, but not ruin her book-writing ability, 'cause, you know, she's special that way? Oh, well... I hope no one hates me for reading an Oprah-endorsed book. I had reservations about this book before I even read it, so that may color my response.I wish I had been her editor. First of all, the breathless giddiness of the "Italy" portion of the book is grating, because it's almost as if she's embarrassed, or apologetic, or something, especially when she moves on to "India" and the tone immediately shifts to one of utter self-seriousness.I also would have told her to chop off about a third of the first part of her book. Why do I need to know the details of her financial situation? Anyone who can take a year off and travel to Italy, India, and Indonesia has the means, so why does she need to go into excruciating detail about how she GETS those means, and worse, DESERVES those means. Utterly irrelevant, and utterly disgusting.Also...I know from experience divorce makes the people who get divorced VERY SELF-CENTERED. But you GET OVER IT after a while. You would think she would have made it into the "gotten over it" category, but no. She still writes (even at the END of the book) as if she is the first person in the history of humankind to ever get divorced, and her pain is uniquely, uh, painful. Give me a break.Lastly, it's very disheartening that a book ostensibly about a spiritual journey to the self begins with details about her Manhattan real estate holdings and ends with... her landing herself a man. Well, congratulations on all fronts. How spiritually evolved of you.
