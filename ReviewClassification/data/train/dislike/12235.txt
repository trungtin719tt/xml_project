I know this is a classic for many readers but I expected more, honestly.Watchersis my first read byKoontzso I have nothing to compare it to, but my first wander into his mind was disappointing. And a little weird.It could partly be that this particular book doesn't withstand the test of time. There are definitely aspects that feel dated (I got a bit of shock when I realized how long ago 1987 actually was!). Even the array of stereotypical characters here felt old-fashioned-- ex soldier hero, abused beautiful damsel, cold-blooded psychopath, and a super precocious dog.Admittedly, these days you cannot possibly meet a beautiful damsel in a thriller without her being behind it all, but I'd rather that than this sheltered abused beautiful virgin who is oblivious to her beauty and quickly breaks through her abuse trauma to aid Travis. And isn't it also very convenient that no one in this book has a job to go to because of inheritance, investments, or a mysterious caller who pays you to off people?Watchersis about Travis (ex-soldier), Nora (damsel), Vince Nasco (hitman) and Einstein (the dog). Koontz takes us through several different perspectives and gradually (read: very slowly) uncovers the story about what is going on at Banodyne Labs. And... it's obvious, isn't it? I didn't really feel like there was much mystery here, and the ending just seemed to peter out under its own predictability.Which might have been fine if I'd enjoyed the characters and/or the getting there, butall of the characters feel one-dimensional and based in stereotypes. And I like dogs as much as anybody but Koontz's dog love is a little weird, I gotta say. What's with having a "talking" dog as a main character, anyway?Watchersis always the Koontz book that seems to get mentioned, but I'll try another if anyone has any better recommendations. For those curious about this: I should also point out that this thriller has some sci-fi aspects.Blog|Facebook|Twitter|Instagram|Youtube
