You're not gonna believe what happened to me! I started Cold Mountain! Julie suggested it and I got all excited and immediately downloaded it and started reading it at like 4 in the morning. I was going along, having fun, this certainly is a fast-moving story, and then....suddenly I was done.I'd fucked up and downloaded some kind of bullshit abridged movie adaptation. It was like 50 pages long.And the thing is, now I know everything that happens! I can't just...start reading the real book. It'll be too weird! I'm going to have to wait like a year before I try reading the actual thing.Gah, I'm so mad at myself. This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me.
