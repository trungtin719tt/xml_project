Oh man, this cover is so gorgeous I feel bad that I'm not going to read it!After the travesties of Fallen and Torment I refused to read any more. But just looking at this beautiful cover makes me want to eat my words. I gave my copies of the books away and now I want to go and buy hardcover versions! And I HATED the books and was miserable for days after I read them.A pity the Passion cover was so crap, because this one is up to the same standard as the first and second and it's so beautiful I want to cry!
