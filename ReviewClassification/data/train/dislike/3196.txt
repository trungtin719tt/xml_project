This book has been recommended to me for years. Everyone has been telling me how funny it is and...Nope.Didn't laugh. Didn't smile. Didn't even blow air through my nose. Not once.I eventually continued it as an audiobook otherwise I wouldn't have finished it.It felt like a kid story. Maybe I don't get the British humour (I feel like I usually like it tho). But I just couldn't get myself to care.Meh.
