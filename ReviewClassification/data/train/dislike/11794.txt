Written in a very simplistic way, one story line, nothing going on but the conversation or action currently on the page. I can see how it could easily be made into a movie as it is very low on content and high in maudlin emotion. Being a romance it has to have some silly language, in this case the overuse of the word "tightening". Take this line, "The breeze was blowing through her hair, and the sight of it made something tighten in his stomach." If that isn't enough to get you giggling, take these lines, "There was something mysterious and different about the way he acted, something masculine. And that made him unlike anyone she'd ever met before." Am I the only one who thinks this is funny? Despite myself, I've been eyeing corked bottles. Should I send a message in a bottle?
