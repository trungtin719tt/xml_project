Maybe I'm being too cynical, and that the protagonist (I forgot her name already, so I'm just going to call her Jane) did go through something worth lamenting for 200 pages. But for God's sake just because your character is a silent withdrawn introvert doesn't mean your plot has to be the same, it's 150 pages of nothing then BAM! she speaks up! finds courage! The end!!!! LOOK MY HEART IS BLEEDING AND YOU CAN HEAR MY SCREAMS BECAUSE IM LITERALLY TALKING LIKE THIS!!!!! This has to be the worst psychological portrayal of selective mute I've ever read. Ms. Anderson, please don't ever consider a career in counseling.Also, if you're writing about contemporary art, please have the decency to at least read about postmodernism. Look, I'm not saying sketches, oil and print making can't be cutting edge, but Jane's A+ art works make me want to throw up. Her art teacher is meant to be a bohemian liberal artist, but I can see why he ended up teaching high school. To be fair you can't judge a work by reading vague descriptions of its visual composition, but drawing a depressed tree is not conceptual art, and whining about corporate fascism doesn't make you an artist either. Jane is utterly talentless. I wish my current art critic tutor is as forgiving as her art class.The snail pace monologues are full of anguish, you half expect it to boil down to some psycho sadistic plot twist but your common sense tells you this is a book marketed towards teenagers. And yes the ending is disappointing, but I'm so glad Jane is done with her anger management issue.
