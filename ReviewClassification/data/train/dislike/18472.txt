*AKA LOVE, ROSIE IN THE UNITED STATES* I have REALLY mixed feelings about this one. I loved the writing style and the way it was written (in letters, emails and IM's), but it was so FRUSTRATING and it literally took(view spoiler)[50 YEARS(hide spoiler)]for them to finally USE THEIR BRAINS AND JUST TELL EACH OTHER HOW THEY FEEL! It was SO ANNOYING. And then at the end,(view spoiler)[you didn't even get to see them be together, which is what I was waiting for! I NEEDED SOMETHING, EVEN JUST A KISS, BUT NOOOOOOOOO.(hide spoiler)]I don't know. I enjoyed it, but I didn't????
