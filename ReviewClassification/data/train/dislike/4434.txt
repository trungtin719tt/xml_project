This book was recommended to me by my niece. I got her started with vampire books sometime back with Charlaine Harris' Sookie Stackhouse books. And I was the one who introduced her to Twilight. She gave me one of Richelle Mead's Vampire Academy books &amp; I liked it, so figured this series might be okay, too. WRONG!! Others have mentioned the preponderance of pop culture references, which was annoying. However, my main quibbles are with Zoey's "perfectness" and what seemed to me to be a major "Christian bashing". I am not a religious person, but I do believe in God and this book seemed to paint all "People of Faith", as they were referred to in the book, with the "evil-stupid-intolerant" brush. While basically preaching a tolerance of everything else, the "People of Faith" were excluded. Add to this the fact that all the characters seemed terribly one dimensional and the "twins" were a couple of the most annoying characters I've come across in some time, you can be sure I won't bother with any of the others in this series.
