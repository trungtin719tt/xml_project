The best way to describe this book is: it makes no sense whatsoever. Of course, you may say: "Well, Xandra, Paulo Coelho is a profound man, a philosopher. Not everyone gets him."Yeah, ok. I can't possibly argue with that.Now...Veronika is a young Slovenian woman who decides to kill herself because her youth is almost gone and the world is a fucked up place. What? Yes, she is Slovenian. What do you mean why? I don't know why! I guess it's more exotic this way. Shut up!Ugh, I'm talking to myself again. Paulo Coelho is driving me nuts!So, yeah, she overdoses on sleeping pills, but being the lame loser that she is, she doesn't end up six feet underground, but in a mental institution where she is told she only has one week to live. I actually laughed out loud at that. Who wouldn't?You then follow her interactions with a bunch of uninteresting characters, a schizophrenic guy named Eduard being one of them. Actually, no. I'm not fair. Eduard is not a totally uninteresting guy. He's a little kinky and funny and creepy because he likes watching Veronika masturbate while she plays the piano. Didn't seethatcoming. I mean, Eduard never talks, he's basically a recluse, but after this scene these two weirdos inexplicably fall in love.And this isn't even the best part. The best part is the ending.(view spoiler)[It turns out that Veronika's psychiatrist, a true example of professionalism, was lying the whole time. Veronika isn't sick, it was all a freakish experiment (you know, in the name of science) and of course it worked because now Veronika doesn't want to die anymore and she's gonna live happily ever after with her rich creepy boyfriend Eduard.(hide spoiler)]Great stuff. I'm waiting for "Veronika Decides to Die - a graphic novel".
