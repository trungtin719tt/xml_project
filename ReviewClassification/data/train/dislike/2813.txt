More like 3.5 for me...I didn't liked this book as much as the first one (and not that I liked the first one THAT much, either). You see, in Divergent I loved all the part of the story when Tris was trying to win a spot in Dauntless, it was awesome to read. But when all the rebelion/revolution/whatever thing started, the book went down to me, and Insurgent is ALL about that! And Tris, God, she became insufferable! Always depressed, always taking reckless desitions, telling lies to Four, and she can't even hold a gun anymore. I mean, I tried to understand her, I think I would be worse if I had suffered the things she has, but sometimes she was boring to read. I liked Tris better in the first book.Also, the ending left me all confused, but I think that was the point.
