DNF'd on page 221In theory, I should havelovedthis book. Structurally and plot-wise it reads sort of like a Spanish version of The Goldfinch by Donna Tartt, but I just didn't connect with this story or the writing. Since I was still curious to see how the book ends, I read the plot summary on Wikipedia (I know, I'm terrible) and after doing that I'm glad I decided to stop reading. The book certainly goes in a direction that I didn't see coming, but I don't think it would be worth slogging through another 200+ pages. This was definitely a case of me not being the right reader for this particular book, so by no means take this review as a reason not to give it a try! The atmosphere of Barcelona was great, but that was the only part of this book that really spoke to me.
