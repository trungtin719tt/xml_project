I disliked the book because although some parts were well written, overall it was just rather repetitive. It is nearly impossible to tell all of the mothers and all of the daughters and their respective love interests apart. All of the mothers have the nearly the same issues as do all of the daughters. It would be a better book of the story were not repeated so many times that it loses it's color. It makes it seem like Amy Tan is a one trick pony. This book also has nearly the exact same plot as "The Bonesetter's Daughter". I just feel like the theme of the Chinese immigrant mother having difficulty connecting with their Chinese-American daughters who in turn have problems connecting with their mothers and with their Caucasian love interests was endlessly repeated. It is just the same plot grossly overused. This book was difficult to read, and it was also difficult to understand why it was so popular.
