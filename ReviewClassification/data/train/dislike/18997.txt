WHY THE HELL IS everyone complaining that they think Cassie's writing more books to make cash?! True, I have my own complaints about never ending series, but when you have someone as talented as Cassie, IT KIND OF MAKES SENSE FOR HER TO WRITE MORE. Especially when many fans are ASKING FOR MORE. (ex. When everybody asked for more books in TMI series.) Honestly, I'm sure Cassie has other writing projects that she does that don't involve Shadowhunters, but I'm getting sick of biased people of judging simply because this would be the third series of Shadowhunters that Cassie will be writing. (I don't see fans of Vampire Academy complaining that a spinoff series, Bloodlines is coming out. Or fans of Evermore, when Alyson Noel decided to write a series on Ever's sister.)Why judge so harshly, read the book first. Who knows? It could end up being even better than TID AND TMI.***************Update: IT HAS A TITLE!!!! Lady Midnight!! YES.OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMG OMGYES!!!!!!I am highly anticipating for this book!!!! Cassandra Clare is one of my fav authors and I'm sure she will not disappoint! I can't wait to dive into a new Shadowhunter tale!*runs off screaming with joy, happiness, and frustration at why the book can't come out earlier*
