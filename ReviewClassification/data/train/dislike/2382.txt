what providence: i just remembered this book after I read some holier-than-though pretentious bullshit Mitch Albom wrote about Harry Potter. Mr. Albom-Winfrey seems to think the mass marketing of Harry Potter has ruined the theoretical lives of such figures as Winnie the Pooh, Clifford, Curious George, etc., despite that his own shitty books have been thrust upon the world under the same kind of marketing blitz.As if I weren't annoyed enough at his article, I was subsequently reminded of this little novel, which I read over a few weeks while I was dating a girl; it was in her room, and whenever I found myself there, being bored, I would pick up the thing and read it for a while.Here's the deal. I'm not sure if Mr. Albom is trying tohelpme, orstunme, or just bring a flood of tears to fall on the pages, but I am positive that whatever he's trying to do, he sucks at it. Immensely.There's nothing like one-sentence paragraphs to instill the right amount of melodrama.Sure, his plot is sort of intriguing, but that's not too surprising. I'm pretty sure if I wrote a book called "THE FIVE PEOPLE WHO WILL FELLATE YOU AND CHEW OFF YOUR FACE AFTER YOU DIE," people would be curious enough to read on. Anybody can think of some kind of "5 people" list and turn it into a passable book; I'm willing to bet that 75% of all the people in the world could do it with less corny, Hallmark Brand melodramatic stupid shit. It's like Mr. Albom suddenly realized he would get laid so much more by pretending to be emotionally available, and now he's suddenly the Josh Groban of authors.If you enjoyed this book, you're emotionally weak. If you have some sort of affection for Mitch Albom, you're a middle-aged housewife starved from any male emotional output.God do I hate this motherfucker.
