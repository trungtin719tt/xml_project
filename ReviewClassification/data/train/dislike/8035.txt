...snort...Excuse me; I just woke up. I've been essentially asleep since first picking this book up a few days ago. I had to keep smacking myself to stay awake.Cyberpunk. The matrix. Jacking in. Flipping. And on and on.The cover of my book blurbsWashington Post, which uses words like "kaleidoscopic, picaresque, flashy." Youlie,Washington Post. There's none of that here. There is no flash.This is a story about drugs and computers and awkwardly phrased sex. (The sex itself isn't awkward, but it's written awkwardly, like Gibson thought he should add some sex.) This is an unemotional and fairly uninteresting book with uninteresting characters. I see a lot of people like it, and I know it's a classic of the genre, but I fail to see much in it. I'm not going to say it's the worst book I've ever read, thus the two stars,butthis is a book for my real life book club and I'm fairly certain by tomorrow I won't remember much about this story at all. Which is a shame since our meeting isn't until a week from now. What is there even to discuss?Gibson wrote about stuff that wasn't really written about in the early-to-mid 80s, so there's that. And he coined the termcyberpunk. But there's so little to actually discuss here. The noirish aspects? I guess? Yeah, I could talk about that. As in "I liked the noirish aspects."Looking back at my notes, I see last July at this same time the same book club was readingRendezvous with Rama. What is it with our normally awesome book club choosing boring science fiction novels to read for July?She flipped.
