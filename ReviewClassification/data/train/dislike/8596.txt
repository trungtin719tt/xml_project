Mrs. Meyers and I can no longer be tortured friends. Maybe someday I can finish this poor excuse for a novel, but I'm going to relieve myself of the misery for now. The premise was fine, but the dysfunctional psychological processes of every single character has me truly sick. Not to mention that Melanie Stryder, (i mean, Bella Swan...) is essentially the same pathetic female character that we've seen in the Twilight series. I'm done.I have been mystified by this writer because so very many people adore her, but I just don't get it. What is going on here? I've tried to understand it, tried to give it the benefit of my time, and all i get out of it is a surge in my blood pressure from pure undiluted frustration. It's tragic that a person so gifted with plot construction is singularly unable to portray gratifying or realistic characters with any thread of substance. Then again, I haven't finished the book - but right now, I can't see that happening.Two days earlier:...i'm struggling even to continue.The day before:On chapter 20-something of the audio version. So far, the writing is acceptable, the plot interesting. Still, there's an icky stickly something that still bothers me about the way Mrs. Meyers writes...the logic that all her characters utilize seems flawed in some fundamental way. But, I'm squirming much less than while listening to the Twilight series.
