I know everyone's supposed to love this book, but I just don't see what's so great about it. The character of the caterpillar is never properly developed, and he comes across as a one-dimensional parody of a larval form. The plot is dull and predictable, as is the language. I'm not thrilled by the artwork.If it weren't for the fact that George W. Bush praisedCaterpillarso highly, I'd unhesitatingly call it vacuous, uninspired rubbish. I must be missing something, but what?
