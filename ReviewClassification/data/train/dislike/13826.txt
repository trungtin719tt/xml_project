Series review (of the first three books anyway):This series wasn't my favorite. The books were fun in places and the concept was certainly good and brought up interesting topics and issues, but I really didn't care for the main character, which kind of ruined it for me. The ending was also quite unexciting. The writing style was very unsubtle and not the best, IMO (although it did improve slightly over the course of the three books). They might be fun books to just breeze through and enjoy without thinking about too much, but I read them as buddy reads, which made me more critical. Also, be warned- in the second and third books some of the characters practice self-harm, and I definitely thought it was not dealt with well. The first book was a 2.5 stars rounded up for me, the second like a 2.75 stars because I liked the love interest introduced in that one, and the third got bumped down to 2 stars because of the way the cutting was handled and the disappointing ending.
