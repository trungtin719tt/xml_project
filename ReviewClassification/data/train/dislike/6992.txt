When I was in high school, the local video arcade passed out fliers that that evening, after a $2 admission, you could play all the video games for free. I and several of my friends went and enjoyed ourselves.And then suddenly they closed the doors, turned off all the games, and a preacher got up and proceeded to try to "save" us.True, we had already gotten our money's worth, and we wecouldhave gotten up and left (even though all of us wanted to but none of us had the nerve). But we still felt deceived and cheated.This is how I felt readingThe Amber Spyglass. I was lured in by the promise (and the deliverance) of an exciting story in an utterly compelling world. But then in the third book, Pullman closed the doors and turned off that great storytelling and I found myself sitting through a tedious sermon waiting for it to be over already.
