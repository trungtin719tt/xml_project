I must be a masochist of sorts to have put myself through this book.The word that constantly came to mind when i read this book was 'contrived'. Everything felt so contrived about this book.The characters, especially the four primary members of ya-ya. Each had a character that seemed to have been pushed on them, and each of their conversations played out like a badly rehearsed school-play. Very mechanical, and very predictable.There seemed to be a lot of characters and information in the book that didn't seem like it had a reason to be there. For example, the only reason i could see for the dog in the book is to fill up some pages. For that matter, one could have actually made do without Siddalee as a main character.What i hoped would be a light read in between the more intense novels turned out to be a nerve-grater instead. The endless descriptions and poorly made up metaphors were painful. Again, those felt too contrived. Even in the most boring of books i have read so far, the descriptive pieces didn't really bother me, but this one sure did.I was wondering if coca-cola paid for putting promos in this book.Well, i have to confess that there were bits that did grip me. However, those bits were few and far between. If only more attention was paid to action and plot in the book than to inane attempts at trying to describing everything.
