This isn't as good as the first, in my opinion. I was hoping for more interaction with Anne and Gilbert. Though they are both members of the Avonlea Village Improvement Society, the two of them actually do not have many scenes together since he teaches at a school that is further away and is only home on weekends (I think?) and during summer break.The addition of the troublemaking orphan Davy to the story nearly ruined this book for me. He has a twin sister named Dora who is a total angel, but Anne plainly states (and Marilla feels the same way) that she loves Davy more. I didn't find him charming, adorable, funny, precious, etc. I wish I could erase his existence in these pages. I hated how Anne was around him: she would feel guilty for punishing his bad behavior and she would give in whenever he turned on the charm around her. Everything I loved about Anne would disappear when she's around this boy. You can't even argue that Anne prefers him because he was a troublemaker like she was when she was a child, because while Anne did get into crazy predicaments, she always had good intentions behind her actions. Davy does not. He makes mischief because he can, because he's bored. I hated how poor Dora would be ignored, but I guess that's really the author's fault since she didn't think of her as much of a character.I still plan on reading at least the third book in the series, but I really, really hope Davy is nowhere to be found in it.
