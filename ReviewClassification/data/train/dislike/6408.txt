I remember viscerally hating this - I found it incredibly boring and I don't think anything reallyhappenedexcept a whole bunch of wank about being a moron and running and a paragraph lovingly describing a side character's butt. I don't even know.Furthermore, it was for eighth-grade English. My teacher gave us a quiz on some random detail-bits, and I remembered little things like how many years had passed between Point A and Point Boring, and that somehow meant that I wasn't actuallyUNDERSTANDINGthe damn book (because it is of course impossible to have a sticky memory and still glean deeper meaning from one's reading), so Teacher and Teacher's Pet called me "petty" for the rest of the day. I totally cried when the Pet got in on it, but that was also because that week SUCKED - my aunt had died of cancer earlier in the week, and the day of the quiz was when I was leaving around noon to go to her funeral....I never actually review books, I just rant about their associated circumstances. Sorry.
