Nietzsche tends to be one of those philosophers that readers either really like (the literary crowd who reads the occasional philosopher) or really don't like (the philosophy crowd who reads the occasional novelist). I suppose I am one of the latter. While I enjoy reading some of Nietzsche's works, I enjoy them most when he centers them around his "ideal man" concept. "Thus Spoke" doesn't seem to be one of those. Simply put, the sections are short situational stories concerning Zarathustra and different people that he meets. Zarathustra imparts his unworldly advice and wisdom to those who do not understand it.Nietzsche was not a religious man, in any real sense of the word, but in this book it is hard to remember that. While I would recommend this book simply because of its "classical" status, I can't say that it was one of my favorites. But, perhaps its only because I do not understand it.
