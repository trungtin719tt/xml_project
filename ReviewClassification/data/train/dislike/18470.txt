Update 2/2/16 FILM IS WAY BETTER!DNF @ 55%.Nope. Nope. Nope. Nope.This book started out really promising. I liked the letters and emails thing, it was something I have never read before. But my God, does Cecelia Ahern know how to drag a story out. And then things kept separating Alex and Rosie and it just got really tedious. I don't care. I don't fricking care anymore!!! They were both unlikeable in my opinion. I didn't ship them together once they got to about 23.The writing was actually okay. It was simple and easy to read but it was too much. I think Cecelia Ahern could have slashed the story in half to be honest. I read a summary of what happens at the end and oh my Jesus, I'm so glad I stopped reading this!!! Cecelia Ahern is now in my bad books. I would not recommend this book to anyone!!!!
