Let me guess: this "Julian" fellow is going to be snarky and sarcastic just like every other love interest CC has written about.I mean, really, where do they get it from?Sure, I LOVE when the main guy in a story is sarcastic and witty, but seriously...try something new.And just by experience, I can already predict things that are going to happen:1) There is going to be another love triangle in which I can predict the ending FROM the first sentence.2) CC is going to over-use certain adjectives explaining Julian's eyes/hair/body, etc.3) They'll end up together. But then there's going to be three MORE books after it.And thats not all.I wanted to bang my head on a table when I read the "only shadowhunter she is forbidden to love". Geez. I definitely didn't predict THAT.And then the next thing you know, she's doing a Harry Potter/Sherlock Holmes/Star Wars/Lord of the Rings spin off.Oh wait. That's already happened...Hmm.
