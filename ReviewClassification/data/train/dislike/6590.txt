No offense to those of you who liked this book. I had a really, really hard time getting through this one. I thought the first book of the series was neat cause it was written by a kid, but sadly, Paolini's story telling ability hasn't grown an iota.Why did Paolini have to make this a four book series. He easily could have taken the 35 pages of actual plot from this book and prepended it to the beginning of the next book. The pace of this book was excruciating.Does there really have to be three chapters devoted to a wedding? I can barely tolerate sitting through a wedding for a person I care about. Does Eragon really need to depart on a 150 page adventure to influence who would become the next dwarf king? Couldn't the dwarfs just have sent a memo. It's not like anyone over the age of three didn't already know who it was going to be.It was painful to watch Eragon spend three quarters of the book whining that he doesn't have a good weapon when we all know where he has to go to get a new one. It was also painful to see Paolini twice find a lame excuse to split up Eragon and Saphira. Do we really need those tearful reunion scenes every time they don't see each other for more than a few days time?Anyways, I'm rambling and I apologize. There were a couple redeeming parts of the book. I generally liked most of Roran's adventures. And I liked the part when I finished and could pick up another book. Too bad I'm way to big of a sucker not to buy the fourth book. Worst of all, when the next book comes out, I'll probably have forgotten how bad this one was and I'll read it again. Maybe it will be better the second time.
