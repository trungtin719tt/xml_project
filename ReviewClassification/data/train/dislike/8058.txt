I found the book so fucking annoying. Why is Zoey such a ho and a hypocrite? She and her friends call Aphrodite a ho when Zoey is a ho! I mean, she was dating Erik, Loren, and Heath. At the same time! Then she goes after Stark and when it's been two or three days she starts kissing up on him! What the hell?The fact that she has to mention that Damien and Jack are gay and that Shaunee and Erin aren't twins gets on my nerves every time!Then she gets all mad when Erik starts to call her a slut! Can you seriously blame him. He walked in to find her and Loren fucking each other! And she gets all hurt when Heath breaks up with her and gets with Casey or something.I couldn't stand this paragraph when I saw it."But I couldn't. I couldn't be alone with him and hurt his feelings. Not yet. Not so soon after losing Loren and Erik and Stark. I couldn't stand him tell me how much he hated me now and how sorry he was that we'd ever been together. He wouldn't say all that in front of Aphrodite. I knew Heath. Yes, he'd break up with me, but (unlike Erik) there wouldn't be any public name-calling and cause a ugly scene. Heath's mom and dad had raised him right. He was a gentlemen through and through and always would be."Um, Zoey, don't ya think that you've already hurt his feelings? Don't ya think that you NEED to be called names? Besides, you barely KNEW Stark. How could you LOSE him?Damn Ho.Shouldn't she have broken up with him from the start instead of cheating on him behind his back?
