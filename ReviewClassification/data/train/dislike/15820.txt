Unearthly by Cynthia Hand, is one of the most cliched, over-ranted YA books I'd ever read. No kidding.There're a lot of five stars reviews for Unearthly, first book of Miss Hand's paranormal series about...surprise, surprise: angels and angel-bloods. (hybrid between humans and angels/Nephilim) There are also handful of famous YA novelists e.g. Richelle Mead and Melissa Marr giving their recommendations, that sounds promising isn't it? Even the cover artwork looks kind of good! But Unearthly had turned out to be so plain, so uneventful and so very...boring that left me utterly underwhelmed after I finished reading it.I want to like this book, trust me I really do. Miss Hand's writing is quite good, I also like how she described the Northern American countryside scenery, but the plot, characters, romance and angel mythology she had created are so very flat and poorly constructed that I'm very disappointed.Clara is our heroine and the whole book is narrated with her fist-person POV without any break, which means we get to hear her thoughts and see things through her eyes ALWAYS but oh boy, Clara's voice is so uninteresting, she barely shows curiosity about her part-angel's blondline and the supernatural abilities it entailed. All-in-all, she barely has any thought about what it means to be an angel-blood and her 'purpose'. Miss Hand simply tells us Clara's mother told her she is an angel-blood and there's a 'purpose' she needs to fulfill and that's it. Clara just sucks it up with hardly any second thought and question, she never pauses and digests the idea of being an angel-blood and what it really means. Maybe it's just me, but I found a heroine so lacking in curiosity, who is so readily accepting her identity as a part-angel to be very uninteresting and unrealistic.There're a handful of YA novels about angels/part-angels/fallen angels, but so far hardly any of them manage to make the concept of angels look so boring like Unearthly does. I found the way which Miss Hand handled and reveled the concept of angels in her book to be counter-productive, stripping almost all of the aspects that makes angels interesting/mysterious/otherworldly/special. So the angel-bloods have wings, they are beautiful to look at and can do things better than the humble little humans, but so what? I can't see them as being deserved the title of 'angel' at all! Simply put, Miss Hand offers us nothing new nor unique about angels.(A special thank to Jun Bisque, who made this jpg for me!)Instead Clara's thoughts and concern are filled mostly by school-related affairs, hanging out with schoolmates and about boys. Therefore I found myself reading a book mostly about the overused 'new girl in a new school and how she gets around things AND ALSO how she gets two hot boys interested in her' trapping, with barely any supernatural happening in sight, although a supernatural YA novel was what I thought I'd signed up for when I picked up Unearthly in the library.Miss Hand also offered me hardly anything to roof for Clara, after reading a book of 435 pages I still know so little about her as a character. I only know Clara is kind and she has a sense of duty, she likes ballet and she is good at EVERYTHING she does because she is an angel-blood, she is beautiful AGAIN because she is an angel-blood even though she has no self-confidence about her own appearance and has to be told she's perfect by a boy who adored the ground she steps on. *sighs* I'm surprised that no one had pointed out how big a Mary Sue she is.Okay, maybe Clara isn't as bad as some other Mary Sues in other YA novels about angels, e.g. Luce Price from the Fallen series and Nora Grey from the Hush, Hush series. But oh goodness, I wish Miss Hand can write a heroine who has more personality and likable quality than Clara nonetheless.As to the Love Interests, I found Love Interest no.1 Christian to be an understandable character, he's being painted as The Picture-Perfect Prince Charming but I at least can see the likable qualities in him and why people like him. On the other hand, I found Clara's romance with Love Interest no. 2 Tucker to be a forced and unconvincing one. At the beginning Tucker is being a jerk to Clara and guess what? He's being a jerk and calling her names because he is secretly in love with her!!! God help me! Is that guy an 8 years old or something? Later Miss Hand seems to try damage-control the Tucker-thing by painting him as the nice, attractive, thoughtful guy but oh boy, the damage is already done.Again the whole Clara-and-Tucker's-romance is filled with a lot of "Tell, Not Show"; the author seems to want making the romance a slowly developed affair instead of some foolish love-at-first-sight thingy. Although I can accept Clara slowly learns to love Tucker but oh my goodness, I don't enjoy being told all of a sudden, Tucker is Clara's ONE TRUE LOVE and stuff. It's too sudden, too unconvincing.Clara's mother plays an important part in the story because she's supposed to be Clara's loving mother and the one who enlightens her daughter about her angel-blood's legacy, but oh boy this woman had done such a poor job on it! She refuses to tell her daughter anything of importance--so Clara, a newbie angel-blood isn't supposed to learn there're women-raping evil fallen angels/The Black Wings out there, and has to be informed about this fact by her fellow part-angel friend!? What kind of mother is that?As to the evil Black Wings in question, we only see a single one of them in Unearthly. But oh goodness, the existence of the Black Wings is only barely mentioned in the book and there's no foreshadowing of the threat. And when a Black Wing actually shows up at the ending part, he looks like a plot-device which Miss Hand called up in the last minute for the sake of creating threat and tension other than a worthy, well-built villain. What a let down!I had mentioned that Miss Hand's writing is good, but sadly her tone is flat, lacking in suspense and tension. Most of the book reads like a diary of an ordinary *human* teenage girl going about her daily life instead of revealing a tale about a part-angel young girl who is coming to term with her true identity and trying to fulfill an important, matter-of-life-and-death mission for the sake of Greater Good. Nope.Still, I'm going to read the sequel, so I'll have to wish myself good luck.Review for book 2:https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...
