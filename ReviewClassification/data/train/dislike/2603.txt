After decades of hearing about this book, I finally settled in to read it. It is quite disturbing, terribly engaging, and a bit haunting. I found myself reading through it in a matter of several days. As I read, I could almost smell the book. I've never read a book that stimulates one sense so strongly. The English translation reads like a 19th-century French realist novel, in a good way.This is exactly why I felt so ... betrayed? ... by the ending. Now, I realize the author was making a statement, but I feel this novel took the easy way out, so to speak. There needs to be a balance between the statement and making the content acceptable to the reader. Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying the ending was offensive. To me, it felt rushed and hokey, and dispelled the effect that the chapters leading up to it had worked to create.Also, please understand that I still strongly recommend that everyone reads this at least once, but in my opinion it does not merit five or even four stars.
