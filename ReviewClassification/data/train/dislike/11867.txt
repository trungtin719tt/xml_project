&gt;&gt;&gt; I wrote the following answering to an inquiry, I repost it here in case anyone else is interested...two stars because it was readable and not overdrawn, synthesis is a virtue I appreciate, especially when the literary value is scarce (it's cliche' galore, as it has already been mentioned).What I did not appreciate is how the characters behaved *before* she got ill: with all his hard feelings against his cold and very rich father, Oliver sets out to become a high income corporate lawyer?? and Jenny renounces a promising pianist career to becomes a decorative wife which contents herself with playing the piano in their very expensive flat?? blah! color me disgusted.(reading here about the sequel I learnt that Oliver ends up working for his dad... surprise? no!)
