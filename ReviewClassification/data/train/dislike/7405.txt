So, it seems there has been a bit of a mix up.I'm a Tupac fan and having read an article that mentioned that Tupac read this book while in prison and found it profoundly enlightening I decided it was a must read for me, I clicked and its sat on the kindle for almost two years , until now.I had no idea what this was about, I just assumed I was going to read a fairly raucous fictional story about a Prince.So you can imagine my shock when I read the opening chapter, i very quickly realised that when it comes to book recommendations, Tupac and me are not compatible.I feel bad for giving this a one star as this is entirely my fault however it meets all the criteria, I had to drag myself through, I understood little and the only satisfaction I received was reaching the end.Sorry Machiavelli.
