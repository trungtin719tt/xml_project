When I read this novel as a teenager, I remember finding the following paragraph strikingly witty:1492. As children we were taught to memorize this year with pride and joy as the year people began living full and imaginative lives on the continent of North America. Actually, people had been living full and imaginative lives on the continent of North America for hundreds of years before that. 1492 was simply the year sea pirates began to rob, cheat, and kill them.Though since then, the point has been made even more economically by the well-known poster below. Maybe it was directly inspired by Vonnegut?_______________________If you want a slightly longer version,this pageis very good.
