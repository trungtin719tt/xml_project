I struggled through this 514-page book.To begin with, all the homo, bi, double-partner, and heterosexual talk was a bit much. Way beyond my comfort level.To be fair, once I got about half-way through the book - after all the characters' sexual preferences were clearly established - it did become a page-turner as I raced to find out the ending.If you like books with lots of character sketches, this might work for you. I was tempted to get out a notepad and sketch out all the characters and their relationships, as I kept getting the Swedish characters' names mixed up.I have not read the prior book in this series: TheGirl With the Dragon Tattoo. Perhaps having done so would have helped me in the first half of the book, though others have said you can read this as a stand alone book.No complaints about the writing style itself. I know this book is getting great reviews; I just didn't find anything in the book that I could personally relate to or particularly felt drawn to. The heroine Salander is as far from my personality as you can get, I think...
