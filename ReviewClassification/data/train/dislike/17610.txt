This book left me wanting to slash my wrists-- especially when I think about the time I spent reading it that I can never get back.Many people loved this book. I am not one of them. The characters are shallow,self-involved and just plain crazy and while I realize that this is just like the people you meet in your everyday I life, it doesn't necessarily mean I want to read about them unless they are delivered in a well-written story that makes them shine a little. This is not that kind of story.Reading this book (and I persisted because I am an open-minded reader) was like trudging through mud. And as open-minded as I am, I just could not take the rather graphic descriptions of molestation and incest. Ms. MacDonald, some times less is more.About 100 pages before the end I was ready to quit. I'd had all I could take of the simpering, whining, craziness and frequent spinelessness of the Piper family. I only kept reading because I was actually interested in the story of what happened to Kathleen in New York.
