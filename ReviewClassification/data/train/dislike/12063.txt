I totally, completely and utterly fail to understand this book. However, as typically befalls me when I read a book by Paolo Coelho, I seem to recall a moment about four-fifths of the way to the end when I had an epiphanic moment - when I realised that although I had loathed the book from the start until that exact sentence, I suddenly understood it and could comprehend and possibly even accept (though grudgingly) that other people could like it and that it could possibly qualify as a Good Book.However, in a similarly typical manner, I reached the end of the book and could not for the life of me remember anything about that epiphanic moment apart from the fact that it occurred. As such, it rates one star because it is painfully bad. Furthermore, I have yet to see or hear anything that even begins to make it clear to me why so many otherwise-sane people seem to love it so much.I'm bored and procrastinating so want to see if anyone else can give me an answer.
