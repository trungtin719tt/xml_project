I read this because Tessy hates it and she thinks I might like it, I gave her a book I hate to read as well.Hopefully I'll like it and win this crazy #hate experimental read.Apparently I lost and I hate it as well.The weird thing about this book is that its very enjoyable to read, there was no boring moments but lots of cringy frustrating part. The plot is really cheesy, I knew before I started reading it but I thought it'll be like to all the boys I've loved before, that I really liked despite all the cheesiness but I was wrong. This book has all the tropes I hate with passion. For a dystopian book, the book has the lamest history ever, and it took just a paragraph to tell us about the war that changed their world, and this was done through a question and answer section.This book is by far the worst dystopian I've ever read, there was no world building, absolutely none, I have no idea what the world is like. Don't even get me started on the rebels, WTF is that, the author didn't even deign us worthy enough to tell us what they want, when it started or a little hint about how the royal guards or soldiers handled the situation. The closest thing to politics we got is the drama between the girls.I expected the plot to be a really cool futuristicBachelor, because I really like the show, instead I got this child's play, The girls are so immature and they act like a bunch of kindergartner children fighting over a toy, not the special edition but the kind that can be found in all stores and market. The writing style did not even help, it was fast paced and that is basically the only good thing about it, the book is written in the first person POV of America the MC it is also filled with lots of internal monologue, and her lame whiny repetitive thoughts.Don't even get me started on the characters, I loathe every single one of them, they are all annoying and have no personality whatsoever, Its like the author couldn't even be bothered with that, they are all one dimensional.Americathe MC is so whiny,stupid, selfish girl, she thinks only about herself with no regard for others, even her family.(view spoiler)[She refuses to enter the competition even when she knows what the money could do for them, She could leave the competition anytime she wants, its not like she'll be force to marry him but no she has to whine and complain before she finally entered.(hide spoiler)]. I don't even know how to classifyMaxonhe is in between cocky and a shy awkward guy, I hateAspenwith passion, he is so selfish and had no regard for others, if you want to know more about him look no further thanMalfrom the Grisha trilogy, but a worse version.This book has so many tropes I hate, here are just the ones I remember-Mary Sue, America the MC is plain, don't think she's pretty etc, but all see her as beautiful and perfect.- Love triangle, the lamest type coupled with insta love.-Slut shaming, if you are pretty,confident and dresses well that makes you bitchy,(that is me, so this book is saying I'm bicthy).I won't continue this series because I hate it and I pretty much know how this will end based on it being too predictable, also America being the narrator and on the cover is a major giveaway.
