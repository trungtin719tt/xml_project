I borrowed this book from a friend, and really have nothing good to say about it. I thought that the plot line was overused, and the writing style left a lot to be desired. The story of a girl dressing up as a a boy to prove herself is something we're all familiar with, and sometimes it's done very well and it's a pleasure to read. However, there was nothing fresh or new about this book, or this series. The characters weren't fleshed out and their difficulties-- hiding identity, physical exhaustion, etc-- weren't very surprising. I felt that this book borrowed heavily from the genre of literature surrounding it, and that it didn't even come up with its own thoughts or takes on what it took.So, if you're taking a long plane trip, this book will keep you from clobbering the person next to you out of boredom. It may also entertain some people, but if you're looking for good fantasy I would beg to point you in the direction ofRobin McKinley'sThe Blue SwordorPatricia Briggs'Steal the Dragon. Both of them feature strong female heroines in semi-magical realms, have horses, knights, and combat. However, Patricia Briggs and Robin McKinley are both, in my opinion, better writers, and the characters and plots are much more fleshed out.
