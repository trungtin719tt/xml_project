Read the first 11 or so chapters Meyer posted on her website. Just as bad as the rest. Edward seems pretty delusional about Bella and her non-existent personality and he's even more creepy from his own point of view. Spying on her while she's sleeping and reading and who knows what else....if it was supposed to be and acknowledged as creepy and slightly wrong I wouldn't have a problem with it. But apparently Meyer thinks it's perfectly normal and acceptable for teenage boys to stalk young girls and watch them while they sleep.The only good thing I have to say about Edward is that at least in this one I can better see the struggle and temptation he has about killing/eating Bella (once again if treated as creepy and weird as it should be I wouldn't have a problem with it) as opposed to Twilight where there was barely any tension at all.Also, about not finishing it just because you are so "upset and depressed" about it being leaked online? Way to be mature and rational. Sometimes I really think Meyer is some whiny teenage girl on the internet writing her own love novel with her playing Bella. I for one wouldn't be that surprised. I guess it helps me keep hope in the human race that a grown woman isn't writing these and seriously thinks she is writing this amazing wonderful perfect romance, because otherwise....I don't know what to think.
