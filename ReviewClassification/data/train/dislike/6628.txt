This book was horrible. Period. A waste of my time. You see, what really pisses me off with this book is this: I have known kids that have come from horribly abusive situations that are more genuine than Pelzer is in his "memoir."The stories of his life in this book contradict one another, are extremely over-the-top and, dare I say, fabricated some. Now, before anyone wants to crucify me, look at the facts:His family members were interviewed and stated that this was pure fantasy. (I can concede that the family members may have lied.)He bought numerous copies of his own book to inflate sales records so that the book would have a better chance at getting on bestseller lists. (Again, I can concede that he was only helping his writing along by wanting his book to be seen by a greater audience.)However, and here is the kicker for me, if this story is true, then shouldn't just writing it and getting the story told redemption enough for Pelzer?A story of this magnitude should be told, there's no doubt about that. But it should be told with grace and humility. Pelzer should have approached this book as an avatar to the thousands of other kids out there that don't have a voice. Instead, Pelzer grandstands and makes the issue of child abuse seem like a sensationalistic piece of family trivia.Very disappointing.WASTE OF TIME
