Want to see more bookish things from me? Check out my Youtube channel:https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfer...1.5 StarsZara White has just been shipped to Maine to live with her Grandmother after she watches her stepfather die of a heart attack. She believes that she has a stalker following her and now he's shown up in Maine as well. The strange thing is, he leaves gold dust every where he goes. With the help of her new friends, she tries to discover what he wants and how to stop him.This book is literally just Twilight redone. The writing was corny and most of the time I was just rolling my eyes at the plot line. The plot was so predictable, I was able to call the entire story within the first 30 pages. Some of the lines in the book are so over used... "I'm not like other girls" is one of my favourites. Zara really pissed me off... She did literally everything people told her not to do... and every thought she had had to do with the 'hottest guy, like ever' Nick. ALSO, Nick is described as smelling "like safety"... I'm sorry, but what does safety even smell like?! All of the characters had no personalities and were so one dimensional. They were your typical stereotypical YA characters you see in every book with no variety.Overall, just a boring read.
