Damn, It was a long day that involved my spend over 100$ on my truck, so to relax I got a pizza and went to the library to find a good horror novel. They were closing early and this looked somewhat promising. I did not realize it was a christian propaganda book untill halfway through. Damnit. It does get a couple stars for being page-turnery. But once you realize what the message is (new-age, mystasism, eastern religion, meditation, humanism... is SATAN IN THE FLESH) and notice that the author wont write vulgarities or nasty words, and every problem is solved in prayer, its gets to be a drag. And I am ok with a religious themed book, but this was pure propaganda. Which sucks all the more because once I figured that out I knew that it would end with God winning. boooooooooring.p.s. does anyone know any good horror novels. I don't have a TV or Computer so i need cheesy novels for my mindless entertainment.
