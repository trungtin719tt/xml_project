WARNING: lots of curse words. :-(First of all to SC Stephens I truly apologize. I tend to have a unofficial kinship with indie authors, but sadly I alwasy do my best to provide an honest review. Besides, Simon &amp; Schuster picked your book up so you can give a fuck what I have to say!Okay!This book sucked!Oh my god!I didn't even want to waste my time and energy searching for gifs to express how disgusted I am with this book.What the fuck???The heroine is a SELFISH WHORE!!!!!I try my best to be nonviolent but if I saw her I would knee her in her vagina!The way she dragged her boyfriend through the mud, whining and complaining while he tried to freakin work at a career MEANWHILE she's fucking his best friend and their (her and her boyfriend's) roommate.I hate cheaters!I've cheated in my lifetime, in high school and once during my early twenties. I am possibly one of the worst cheaters in the world because I can't sit there and lie. I tend to cheat and break up immediatly the next day, explaining that "dude, I'm a dick. I cheated."I've always believed why exert all the freakin mental energy trying to balance two guys. Additionally, I just hate the idea of sneaking around. I'm grown.So for me the constant cheating was just disgusting and disrespectful. I couldn't root for them. For me she didn't deserve happiness.She's all the names I try to avoid saying to women: cunt, Nappy dugout tramp, asshat, once-a-month-bleeding-hoe, cock burger happy meal with a side of herpe fries, Scarred-and-diseased-infected-Snatch, etcI dnf'd the book at 75%. . . .I know you are thinking, "Hey Kenya. She could have changed."I don't care.Now for the WRITING:Oh my god!*She blushed. He blushed. They blushed. The dog blushed. The blushed blushed.*HORRIFIC PACING! The book dragged so much. Fine. We get it. They like each other. They cheat. They treat each other badly. They like each oher. They cheat. They treat each other badly. They like each other. Thye cheat. . .*The writing was elementary as if my six year old sat down and wrote a novel.In fact when I read it, I raced into my daughter's bedroom and questioned her, "Lily! Did you write this?""No, mommy." She BLUSHED."Are you sure? This writing style is so similiar to yours as if you just learned English.""No." She BLUSHED. "I swear. I didn' write that, mommy.""Okay." I BLUSHED.My husband walked in and BLUSHED. "Everything okay?""Yes!" My daughter and I BLUSHED. My three cats came into the room and BLUSHED. I BLUSHED at them BLUSHING so over come with the BLUSHTIVIY of the moment. And then we all hugged each other, BLUSHING at life.:-(
