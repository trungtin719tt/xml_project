If it were possible to rate a book in the negatives, this one would earn a negative 10. Truly one of the most terrible books ever. Maudlin, whiny and ridiculous. A woman whose husband and children are away has a brief affair with a photographer just passing through. Of course, the few days spent with this complete stranger prove that her marriage is a sham and the photographer is her true love...but wifey sacrifices herself in martyrlike fashion and suffers to allow her substandard husband to continue to support her financially while she moons over hidden letters in the closet. I would like to rewrite this book and place it in the stark light of reality, where the neighbors report to her husband that his wife is a whore; when she has to explain to him where she picked up the STD and why there are crabs in their bed; where he throws her out on her ass and she DOES go off with her "true love" only to find that he has a wandering eye and a drinking problem, and often goes off on photographic jaunts where he beds other lonely housewives like herself. Oh, the poetic justice when she finds the crabs in her own bed.
