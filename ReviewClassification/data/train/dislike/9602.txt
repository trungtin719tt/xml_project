okay, so the good things: I liked the world/mythology/etc, and was amused by the Anne Rice reference! And I also liked the subtle pro-gay marriage message.It could have actually been a lot of fun except for the romance part, which went like this: (SPOILERS!)Diana: I am exceptionally good at being a historian of science, and I even have a job at Yale! I am also a witch, but I don't use my powers. Much.Gosh this mysterious manuscript sure is mysterious!Matthew: I AM TALL. I WENT THROUGH YOUR PAPERS AND THEN CAME TO YOUR HOUSE AND WATCHED YOU SLEEP.ALSO, I'M AN ANCIENT VAMPIRE.Diana: Um, okay?Matthew: SAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO DO SOME VAMPIRE YOGA WITH ME?THAT IS NOT A EUPHEMISM, BY THE WAY.Diana: I guess so.

Make sure to drink it every day, and DON'T MAKE ANY MISTAKES WHEN YOU BREW IT. Um, because it might taste bad, not that it's having any effect on you without your knowledge. OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT.Diana: Gosh, thanks!
