Diana Gabaldon needs to finish this series. In fact, she needed to finish it in this book:If she is so crazy about Lord John, keep writing those books about him. Personally, he bores me, and I skipped over those sections. I'm not that into William either, even if he IS Jamie's son.How many times can Claire and Jamie run into pirates and take over a ship? She's done this before inVoyager. And there's lots of other material that repeats or echoes stuff in previous, better books.There are too many points of view and too much skipping from place to place. If you're not interested enough in your characters to stay on them for more than a chapter or so, why bother?And last, but not least, virtually EVERYONE is left in a cliffhanger situation. Nothing is anywhere near being resolved--it just ends!This whole book could have been cut down by about 3/4, added to whatever she is planning for a (hopefully) final book, and published when she is ready to publish that one.But she yielded--to her publishers, her agent, her fans, whoever and as a result we have this mess of a book.Sad, really.
