Okay, so I was reading along, and thinking all, hey, this is pretty interesting! Not bad, Stephenie!And then I got to about page 80 or so, and OH MY GOD THERE IT IS AGAIN, THE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE SAPPINESS OH MY EYES MY EYESI just can't do it. CAN'T DO IT AGAIN! Not the older man, and the younger woman, and the 5-page discussion of why they can't have sex yet because NO DEAR YOU'RE JUST NOT READY EVEN THOUGH YOU REALLY WANT IT BECAUSE LOOK, YOU'RE A GIRL AND YOU CAN'T POSSIBLY MAKE YOUR OWN DECISIONS.BUT JARED I LOOOOVE YOU!! YOU ARE MY SOULMATE! BECAUSE WHY? I DON'T KNOW, I JUST LOVE YOU! MAYBE BECAUSE OF YOUR STRONG JAW AND GOLDEN SKIN AND BLOND HIGHLIGHTS AND LACK OF A PERSONALITY. THAT IS PROBABLY IT.I LOVE YOU TOO, MELANIE! AND I WILL PROTECT YOU! AND NEVER LET YOU DO ANYTHING! EVEN THOUGH YOU ALREADY SAVED YOURSELF AND YOUR BROTHER FROM HORRIBLE ALIENS!i think i need to go lie down now.
