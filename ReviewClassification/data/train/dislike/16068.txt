You know those rare special times when the movie is better n the book? JACKPOT! This is one.To be honest the movie is way way better than this.Yeah love may never be ugly,but for sure this book is.As much as I want to talk about how slow this book is and how incredibly boring and how you can't stand it,I don't want to spoil anything.*"CHEESY"*My advice to you is :"WATCH THE MOVIE"
