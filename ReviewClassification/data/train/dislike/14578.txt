I almost had a heart attack when I saw the cover!!!! :) So beautiful! Delirium is one of my favourite books ever!!! The story and Oliver's writing... Gah I can't even explain what it did to me. I finished the whole book in one sitting which should mean something. I just pray for one thing. I'm positive that Alex is alive. I'm not sure if he'll have the cure or not. The only thing I don't want in Pandemonium is a love triangle. I'm sorry but this always kills romance for me. In my opinion someone may like another person while being in love with someone. But true love should be something unique, that can't be replaced or duplicated. I'm not sure if I could continue reading the series if somehow Lena fell in love with someone else in Pandemonium. I'd prefer Alex was dead. I know, hard thing to consider too, but I would know then that romance in Delirium wasn't killed. So, please, let true love conquer all! Let her found a male FRIEND who will not fall in love with her and save her man like every woman in love should do!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!EDIT: Everyone, including myself, thinks this story will eventually end with a love-triangle. I really hope that Lauren Oliver will surprise us all. Taking the road of a love-triangle is only a way to fill the holes in your plot created by the lack of your imagination. Delirium is an ode to love. I really hope she won't destroy that for me.
