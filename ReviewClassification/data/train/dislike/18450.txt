This book doesnt have a love triangle-It has a love hyper-rectangle I mean the potential love interests throws themselves at the main character wherever she goes.So if youre a die-hard Twilight fan this book might be for youThe main character is 16-year old Kylie,her parents are getting a divorce and she keeps seeing this weird figure on her front lawn thats invisible to everyone else but her.To get away from it all she goes to a party that ends badly when the police breaks up the party, with her being arrested because the police who broke up the party found some drugs And then she gets sent off to a camp for troubled teens.Troubled teens being an euphemish for troubledsupernaturalteens.I have to admit I had so many issues with this book.At first I respected Kylie for wanting to save her virginity for someone special,then she let the reader know what happens if you hurry into losing your virginity (her friend does) You sleep around,start to party hard and wear revealing clothes (IT COULD HAPPEN TO YOU!)So basically the author is saying you can be a madonna or a whoreOoIn the end she got a holier than thou personality I especially like *sarcasm* how she admits feeling good about listening to other peoples problemsSo the main character is a girl who looks down on girls who arent virgins,take comfort in friends problems and twists her father around her little finger. hmm well she sounds so nice!And the twitching eyebrow thingy...was just so so silly.You have to read it just to understand what I mean.And also the "your power is like this but were going to imply that your powers are way different"Holiday "We dont know what you are"Kylie "But I see dead people.."Holiday "Youre like me-a ghost whisperer"Kylie "So you do know what kind of supernatural I am!"Holiday: "Will you leave me alone if I just nod mysteriously and say no?"
