There had never been a death more foretoldBased on a true incident Gabo was involved in, simply put - the story is about how a bride is returned after her wedding night after her husband realizes that she is not a virgin. On being questioned the bride names the person responsible and her brothers set out to find and eventually murder the person in question. The back-cover reads the summary as mentioned above. How far can a writer take it from here?It is astonishing to see the various angles through which Gabo can narrate a story, be it a cold journalistic approach without compromising on the tender touch of humanity or the magical realism narration which doesn't need any introduction.As the story proceeds, the only thing revealed is that Santiago Nasar is innocent and what remainsis the reason behind the bride uttering the name as she did. This leads an inevitable outburst of incidents leading to the death of Santiago Nasar.On further analysis, it seems to me as the tension between the misogynous tendencies of men and the encumbered women manacled by orthodoxy responsible for the outburst of events leading to Santiago Nasar's death. The daughters of the town are reared to be unquestioning and obedient women as the mother of the bride puts it - Any man would be happy with them as they have been raised to suffer.Ironically the men in the town have suffered due to the complexity of the mind of the women.I could elaborate further but the last thing I would want to do is spoil it by over-analyzing and let the magic of the book be which stands as a testimony to Gabo's story telling capabilities.
