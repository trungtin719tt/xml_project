Okay, I get it. This book was designed to feed the ego of every woman who believes she's supermom. I found Denise's obsession (portrayed by Sparks as devotion) with her son, Kyle, too easy, too pleasing and, at times, entirely sickening. I mean really, wouldn't repeatedly restraining him in a chair, often for hours on end, until he finally utters a single word be considered abuse in some states? How silly! I found myself appalled at her lack of self identity. Even worse, the story was SO predictable I often felt I could have written it better myself. Admittedly, I'm not what you'd call a Sparks "fan". I have read and enjoyed a few of his books, and this one screamed "afterthought". Perhaps it was a quick write and quick publish designed to ride the waves of his enormous success. At least, that's what I hope.
