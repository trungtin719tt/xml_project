I hated this book. Said enough? I put off writing the review as I know others will disagree. It's not that it isn't well written, it's not that the characters aren't done well. In the words of a friend of mine when her husband talked her into reading it..."Why would I like this thing?"Some will not agree with me, and that's fine, but I have lived through relatively tough times, I've lost loved ones, I've struggled for something only to have it fall through. These are not my leisure time activities. When I spend my money on a novel I'm not looking for nihilism. This is another book in the "life is hard and then you die" school.So, if your sitting there thinking that "great art" always depicts pain then this is the book for you. Obviously some movie makers feel that way, but I don't. I gave it 1 star, there are well written parts of it, but for me the rest just isn't worth it. If it's your cup of tea, enjoy.
