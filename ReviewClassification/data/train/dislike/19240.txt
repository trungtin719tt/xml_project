GR Giveaway.Ok, I tried. I am not going to read this tripe any further.From the first 50-ish pages that I did read, this books sounds somewhat like the show 'Sex and the City'. Rachel is part-Miranada - a not so good looking lawyer, and part-Charolette - miss goody two shoes who wants to find a husband and settle down. Darcy is part-Samantha, part-Carrie, she has good looks and has always managed to make the guy she liked fall for her and is now engaged to a guy she wants to marry. And just like the show, these two 30-yr. old women can't think or talk about anything beyond dating and men.Both the main characters are annoying. Darcy is a shallow self-serving bitch and Rachel lacks a backbone. They have been best-friends since childhood. But their friendship doesn't seem credible at all. Darcy is self-centered and insensitive and has been running all over Rachel forever. Rachel has an inferiority complex and is jealous of her so-called best friend's charmed life....to them a good life being defined by the number of boyfriends they have had. I don't see why the two are friends at all. And Rachel is trying to use this jealousy as a reason to justify sleeping with her best friend's fiancee...Ugh!I finally put the book down at a point where Rachel is talking about how she had begun to dislike her boyfriend in college because he was rooting for Duke's basketball team and not Indiana.And the writing is really nothing worth mentioning.The book also contains a page suggesting questions for discussion, it seems the publishers expect the readers to ponder over this subject matter after reading the book...yeah, right!!
