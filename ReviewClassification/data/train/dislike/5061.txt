Oof... it took me 12 days to finish this book. Not like me at all.I liked the storyline. I love the fact that it is a book about books, and that is what initially made me want to read it. I read the blurb on the book and it sounded like a really fun read.I was wrong.The book was VERY long-winded. Whilst the plotline was good, and the characters were nicely built, the actual story dragged on most of the time. The best part of the book is the last few chapters, by which point I didn't care - I just wanted the book to end so I could move onto something more enjoyable.I've given it 2 stars because the story is interesting, I just think that it could have been condensed into less pages. Either that or the writing could have had more cliffhangers - therefore making it more unputdownable. Maybe if I could read German, the original book may be more enticing. It's always possible with translations that the book doesn't end up coming across as the author intended it to. I guess I'll never know.I have no desire whatsoever to read the other books. I think this generally works on its own as a standalone novel, but the thought of reading another 500 pages doesn't fill me with joy.
