Review revived again to mark the three month anniversary of the Top Lists being frozen....***As you know, the votes we strive for and crawl across barbed wire for and win oh so slowly and painfully are the only way we reviewers can tell we're still alive. We need the hit that only weekly Top Lists can give us. And yes, you could describethe inexplicable absence of up to date Top Reviewer and Best Review Listsas a "first world problem" if you were being really mean, but still, reviewers are people too... Let Samuel Beckett explain further.*****ESTRAGON : Stuff this for a game of soldiers. Let's go.VLADIMIR : We can't go.ESTRAGON : Why not?VLADIMIR : We're waiting for the Top Lists to be displayed correctly, remember?ESTRAGON : Oh those.VLADIMIR : Yes, those. Without the Top Lists we don't know who's top and who's - well, bottom. The world is chaos. Which review is best? Which made it in the mad-salmon-dash up the goodreads river of reviews to spawn in the sun?ESTRAGON : You're very poetical tonight. Did you eat something that disagreed with you?VLADIMIR : We must have the votes correctly tallied. It says so in the Bible.ESTRAGON : But the vote counter is broken.VLADIMIR : (sighs. Gives up trying to unlace his boot.) Yes, the vote counter is broken.ESTRAGON : It's a sign.VLADIMIR : It is a sign. But we have to wait.ESTRAGON : What for?VLADIMIR : For the vote counter to be fixed. We must.ESTRAGON : I could go, you could wait. I think I left something in the oven.VLADIMIR : You'll be back. Us sort, we have to wait.ESTRAGON : For the vote counter to be fixed.VLADIMIR : Yes. But we know it never will be fixed.ESTRAGON : Yes. But we have to wait even so.VLADIMIR : We should ask Rivka.RIVKA (appearing from a cloud) : There is a bug. We have identified it. It will be fixed. But not yet.ESTRAGON : See? I told you. It's hopeless.VLADIMIR : No, not hopeless. But there is no hope.
