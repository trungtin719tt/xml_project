Even though I didn't finish this awful book, I find that over a week later I'm still FURIOUS about this:The heroine is a penniless single mom who works the night shift as a waitress and during the day takes care of her disabled 3-year-old. The first time the hero comes to her house--on an unplanned visit--he notes that even though the place is old, it's spotless. From this, of course, we're supposed to infer that the heroine is a hard worker, has high moral fiber, and is good wife material.BULLSHIT! Did the feminist movement happen for nothing?? Do people still not realize that housework is WORK, not a sign of character or a mark of femininity? For people who have enough leisure time to keep their houses spotless, or enough money to pay someone else to do it for them--that's great, I'm happy for you.But if you're a single parent and work full time at a minimum-wage job, by all means spend your precious few leisure hours reading books or meditating or sleeping or taking a walk or, heaven forbid, posting on facebook, and if your house is a mess I won't think a bit less of you. In fact, if you slave away to make your house spotless, I'm going to question your judgment, and wonder why you bought into the ridiculous mindset that "cleanliness is next to godliness." Leave a few germs around, for heaven's sake; your son's immune system will be stronger.
