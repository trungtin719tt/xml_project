Real Rating: 1.5* of fiveI made a huge mistake. I thought this wasThe Beans of Egypt, Maine. It wasn't...it was the hallucinations of apregnant and sleep-deprivedKingsolver transmuted to fiction. I daresay its fans would say "art;" I beg to differ.Like the unbearable gynergy ofThe Mists of Avalon, the fog of womanness that enshrouds this book blocked my view of its merits.
