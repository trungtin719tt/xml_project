Well I have a few different feelings about this book. This is my first novel I've read by this author. I went from intrigued, to curious, to confusion, then at last disappointment. I get the whole storyline and that was good, but if you're looking for a happy ending or any kind of vengeance for the victims, you are not going to find it here. And I'm not sure if it was the kindle format or what, but I was so confused by how it would start talking about one character then the next swipe of the book would start talking about someone/thing else. And I did find a few discrepancies. For instance, when Mohammad is bringing the money, and he is clearly the only one in the scene, then it says that Sadiq unzips the bag. Hello? No Sadiq in this scene. It was just odd to read. Not the worst I've spent on a mediocre book. It just could have been better.
