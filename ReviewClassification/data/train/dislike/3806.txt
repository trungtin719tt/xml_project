Fallenis one of those books that should not be judged by its cover. Despite the alluring, ambiguous plot promised by the book jacket, this book fell flat in way too many areas.The story is about Lucinda Price, who is sent to Sword and Cross boarding school after being suspected of arson. She also claims to have seen shadows stalking her, which only adds to the paranoia people presume of her. There, she meets some nice friends - but no one compares to the attractive and mysterious Daniel Grigori. He keeps sending her mixed messages: sometimes he tries to keep Luce around, and other times he flicks her off. Despite his roller coaster attitude, Luce finds herself being pulled toward him like a moth drawn to a flame, and will sacrifice anything to get closer to him.The beginning ofFallenwas not that bad. It seemed like a typical exposition in an urban fantasy - character goes to so and so place, meets so and so people, finds him/herself attracted to so and so, etc. However, this book continued to crawl at a snail's pace the entire story. Nothing in the first 400 pages seemed relevant or necessary to the plot as a whole.The characters were irritating for the most part. I did not connect to Luce or Daniel. So when the two characters I did not connect with connected with each other, their relationship seemed forced and awkward. There was no explanation of why or how they fell in love, and the author did not craft the chemistry well.Fallenwill appeal to many readers because of its lustrous cover, but ultimately contains average writing and does not satisfy.Want to read more of my reviews?
