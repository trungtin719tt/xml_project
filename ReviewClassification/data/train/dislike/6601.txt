Spoiler Alert - Though it started out really well, I hated the ending! In typical Sparks fashion, your not left with a happy ending. Though I have been a fan of his (The Notebook is one of my favorites), I am growing weary of these endings. I just don't like to invest my time and the roller coaster of emotions he sends you through only to be left unsatisfied. (If you've seen the movie Cold Mountain, you may get what I mean. I felt the same way at the end of it, "Hello...I spent 3 hours watching this movie for this!) Anyway, I felt like this could have been a really good book had it ended differently. I mean the poor guy is left with absolutely nothing, while (thanks to him)she goes off into the sunset with another man. Yes, it was a great selfless act that he did, but it doesn't make for a great ending. Did I mention the man was left with nothing! hehe
