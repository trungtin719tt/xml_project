OMG, Ihatedthis book. It was painful to read. I spent a good 3 hours trying to read this book and ended up skimming the rest of it so I could be done with it.MacDonald covers just about every topic in her book: racial tension, isolation, domestic abuse, and forbidden love, which leads to incest, death, and even murder, but does it in a very complicated way that will turn many readers away.I consider myself a strong reader-one who has fantastic reading comprehension but this book tests even the strongest of readers. I felt that I had to read for days in order to get the jest of what she wrote about 30-50 pages back. It was ridiculous.I consider myself pretty open to reading just about anything but this one just was too much....I think I'll stick to my VC Andrews for my abuse and incest stories. She does them so much better than MacDonald did...and that's not saying much is it?I'll give it 1 star but to be honest I wish Zero stars was an option...maybe even negative ones. I will not be reading anymore of her books.updated shelves June 2011: zero stars due to skimming and not fully reading
