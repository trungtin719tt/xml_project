This book is about a the most special different unique girl half black-half-Japanese girl in the world who has a super ultra extraordinarily rare disease which nobody can figure out which makes her allergic to everything, therefore she has to stay inside all day, who meets a boy who moves in next door, andit is exactly as boring as it sounds. There is such a thing as trying too hard.I feel nothing for our doomed character. I don't really care that she could kick the bucket at any moment as she randomly develops an allergy to her clothes, her mom, the furniture. I don't care about her. I don't feel bad for her. She is sheltered, dull, emotionally underdeveloped. I have no fucks to give about whatever silly ass random hopes and wishes and dreams she has (go to Hawaii! Whoo! That's my dream too. Whoop de doo).There are cute little drawings! Whoo! There are book spoilers (the mouse inFlowers for Algernondied, and that book did make me cry in 5th grade).The Cute Boy Next Door(tm) sends her emails! They slowly fall in love!The end. It is that boring. Who gives a fuck?In all seriousness, I don't really read contemporary books, and I have criterias for them. They're supposed to make me feel for the main character. I want to suffer along with them. I want to fall in love along with them. I want to experience their joy, their pain. In a book in which a character is pretty much doomed from the start, I want to live each breath with them like it was their last.This book did nothing for me. There's a Bundt cake that "commits suicide" in the book. I felt more emotion for that cake than I did for anyone in this book.
