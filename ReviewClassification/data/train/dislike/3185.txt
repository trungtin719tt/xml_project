This is kind of a feminist version of the Arthurian legend (I say "kind of" for a reason;Nenia's reviewoffers several reasons why it's arguably quasi-feminism at best). It's well-written but I got bored, and it was long-winded, and I simply didn't care about any of the characters. I didn't find any of them particularly likeable or sympathetic. I skimmed most of the second half.
