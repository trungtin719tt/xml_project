I winced, cringed, and rolled my eyes through this. The only other Irving I'd read was Garp and I absolutely adored it...until about the last third. The spell Irving had woven over me wore off and the book started to grate; this one wore out its welcome in the first hundred pages.I can't stand the precious little phrases the characters use constantly throughout the book (what?, open windows, 464, blah, blah, blah) and the motifs from the author's other works (bears, athletic obsession, lust, castration fear). The work starts out in the town of Precious and moves on to Cloyington and then settles in Contrivedville.To me, this stuff is the bastard child of Dickens &amp; Tom Robbins. That mix obviously appeals to many readers, I'm just not one of them. I still have a copy ofA Prayer for Owen Meanythat I intend to read, as I am told that's his best work. Maybe I'll enjoy that one. I certainly hope so.
