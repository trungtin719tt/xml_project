Hm. When this book arrived, I wasn't so sure if I should read it right away or if it would be better to wait for the final book of the trilogy,Forever, to be available. In the end, I was simply too curious ;).But a small warning: This book ends on a major cliffhanger.Altogether, the book wasn't bad - rather slow, though - but it was one of those sequels that wouldn't really have been necessary in my opinion.While I wasn't totally ecstatic about Shiver, I definitely would have remembered it as a beautifully written stand-alone book with an ending that made me hope for a better future for the two main characters. It didn't need a sequel.Now, in Linger, the whole story seems to move backward instead of forward: Grace suddenly feels sick, and it is indicated that she can't escape her destiny to be a wolf much longer (Seriously, why exactlynow?). Sam struggles with his new-found life and also with the young wolves Beck has brought with him from Canada.The only aspect that added something new was the introduction of Isabel's and Cole's point of view, which made the story more fresh and interesting.I already liked Isabel in Shiver and although Cole is a rather uncomfortable character, making those close to him suffer with his self-destructive beheaviour, I couldn't help but like him as well.What really infuriated me though were Grace's parents. They suddenly get the idea that they should keep an eye on their teenage daughter because her boyfriend is clearly having a bad influence on her. Sure. And they do it in exactly the way that makes children hate their parents for not taking them seriously. I'm really not sure why they behaved the way they did - maybe there will be an explanation in the next book - but to me, it felt like a rather weak plot device to make Grace and Sam's relationship more difficult and add a forbidden flavour.All in all, I couldn't shake the feeling that some of the conflicts here were only created to have something to write about, therefore only three stars from me.But I have to admit that I'm going to read Forever nevertheless (I suppose a normal reaction concerningthatcliffhanger), I simply want to know how the story progresses.Edit: I've decided to remove a star here. Now that it's been a while, my curiosity to read the sequel has diminished and I'm actually not the slightest bit interested in the story anymore. I think Grace's and Sam's relationship - and let's face it, that's the only thing these books are about - has never really resonated with me.
