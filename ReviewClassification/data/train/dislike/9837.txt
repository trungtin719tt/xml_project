I reviwed the earlier books and found them to be very teen-oriented and entertaining, but this book will be the last that my girls or I will read. The main character, while protesting every page that she really is a good and virtuous girl, has managed to sleep with her teacher, hook up with an ex-boyfriend, hook up with another ex and then hook up with a guy who is half rapist, half "misunderstood." You can tell the authors are heading in the direction that becuause this story is make believe, it's okay for the main character to have a "consort" and a "mate" because she is a vampire. As a mom, I don't care if it's a fantasy world, the authors go out of their way to create realistic modern teens, and this is about the worst role modeling I've seen. There is a gay character, and the authors mention he is gay at least every page if not more. I know these books are extremely popular, and there are worse books, but the direction these are heading is straight down, which is a disappointment for a promising series.
