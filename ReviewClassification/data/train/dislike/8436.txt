Imagine what WEST SIDE STORY would have been like if Maria had married Chino like a good little girl. And Tony just sat around Pop's Soda Shop feeling sorry for himself. For ten years.David Guterson has written a careful, elegant novel that pushes all the right liberal buttons (racial prejudice, evil military men, small town nastiness) but resolutely avoids any kind of heat, sexual, political, racial, or otherwise. The "oppressed" Japanese are sentimentalized to the point of being laughably unreal. The white, small-town rubes are a flock of sheep. They're all empty-headed gossips as well as weak-minded bigots. Small towns are all alike. Big cities are full of enlightened, independent thinkers. Natch! (This story must have really wowed them on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Hey, that's where all the book reviewers are. Do you think maybe . . . maybe Guterson planned it that way? Nah . . .)What makes this book so offensive -- is that it isn't offensive. There's nothing in it that anyone IMPORTANT could find frightening, or objectionable. It's written beautifully, with tasteful nature descriptions on every page. It's all very careful, very reverent, very dull.
