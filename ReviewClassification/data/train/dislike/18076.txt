oops i slipped and re-read this for a second time this year. :o-I really enjoyed this re-read! There are so many things that happen in this book that I completely forgot about. I still feel like the oddball with this one though, because I prefer Six of Crows over Crooked Kingdom. It's a great finale, but I feel like there are times when things drag out quite a bit. Regardless, I still love it!
