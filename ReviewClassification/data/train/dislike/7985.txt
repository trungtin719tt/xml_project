2017 Update...Meenakshi, a Goodreads friend for a while now, found this review and it reminded me that I'd actually read this book 5-plus years ago. I had completely forgotten it existed, both the book and the review actually...and then I got to the "how to die" thing and was instantly transported into annoyed, irked, ticked-off memoryland.I think it's unsurprising I didn't hold onto the memory of reading the book since I review over 120 a year and read almost three times that many. But I also think it's really sad that a book's one memorable feature is how extremely annoying one of its catchphrases is. Cudgel my brain though I will, I can't recall anything I'd actually enjoyed in this reading process. It was a long popcorn book, cocktail-peanut book, an unchallenging unmemorable uninspiring this-is-my-version-of-TV book.**************************************************************I read The DaVinci Code and, while I didn't find the writing to be high caliber stuff, I was mesmerized by the story and fascinated by the evident command Brown showed of the background material. Its factuality is of no interest to me either way. I wanted a rollicking good ride, and I got one, and I walked away a satisfied customer.Less so here. We have the elements of the DaVinci tome's megasellerdom deployed in a less intriguing plot. One of the Big Reveals is simply uninteresting to me, and the repetition of the catchphrase "the secret is how to die" (no spoiler this, it starts extremely early in the book) made me as irritated as any mosquito's buzzing ever has. I am fairly sure it's intended to convey malice and menace, and build suspense, but I found it jarred on me by somewhere in the 40s (chapters come and go at a dizzying rate, there being 133 of them, plus an epilogue that bid fair to make me urp in its treacly upbeatness, packed into 509pp of text).So why did I read this book? A chance to poke at a hugely successful and wealthy novelist who has never heard of me and will never read this review? Nuh-uh. I think Dan Brown has his storytelling antennae tuned to a fine pitch. I think every bit of his fame and wealth is richly deserved and earned by his honest, sincere, and successful desire to tell a good story to the best of his ability. I wanted to be gobsmacked the way I was by that DaVinci madness, that's why I read the darn book!And I wasn't.No one could be sorrier than I am to say this. Maybe it's a case of once is enough for this reader. Maybe it's just a mood. I tend to think that, had this book appeared just exactly as it is today in 2005, I'd be yodeling its masterful reprise of the preceding volume instead of emitting a small bleat of disappointment.And sales figures, while the subject of messy fantasies for other writers, aren't in the DaVinci league. Others agree with me, and the chorus of "oh, well" reviews is loud.When Brown comes to write his next thriller, even if it features Robert Langdon, I hope it treads new territory. Too many other footprints on this piece of land for Langdon to stand out. Such is the penalty of leadership: You get to blaze, but not possess, the trail.Recommended? Mildly. But only if you're a conspiracy-thriller fan. *damn* I hate like hell to write that.
