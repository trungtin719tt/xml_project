The book started really very well. I liked the first part, I had also a lot of laugh-out-loud moments and I was curious to see what would happen next. I was totally in the story and also liked the characters, they were all so particular and eccentric. But going on with the reading I get bored by the story and, above all, by the characters. These never changed, they always said the same things and behaved the same way. It is as if they didn't have a development: they were the same from the beginning of the book till the end, at least 30 years later. Also, from the second part of the story every event and every behaviour of the characters was predictable. I already could foresee what would happen and what they would have done. Maybe the only character that had a small change in her personality and that surprised me was Melony. I arrived at the end of the book that I had enough of the characters and their lives.
