A boy and a girl meet. They fall in love. The girl dies. And we have one of the best romances of all time. SERIOUSLY?! I may as well give it no stars as far as the plot is concerned.I started it today, I finished it today and I can't decide whether it's a good thing or otherwise. Writing a short novel is fine but why do i feel like I missed the part where I was supposed to feel the love seeping through the pages (?) There's no chemistry between the couple at all.The characters are not really likeable. Oliver claims to love Jennifer and he makes her give up on her dream to go to Paris and study Music so that they could get married (not to mention at a very early age). You call that 'love', eh? I don't remember him changing his career goals for her. I even fail to understand exactly why Oliver hated his father so much. There are actually so many things I fail to understand about this book.The writing is simple,the attempts of humour are not completely in vain. It's one of the least descriptive novels I've ever read. The story just goes on and you don't FEEL it.
