it's an emotional roller-coaster.Wasn't much into it actually. Even the movie, it wasn't a favorite of mine. But the book was a gift from one of my friends and I thought I should give it a try. One of my main reasons of reading this book is my previous reads of other novels that were made into movies. Although those movies weren't that good, the books were absolutely amazing.As for this case, the movie and the book hold 2 stars in my humble opinion.
