I don't give a lot of one-star ratings, but WOW. WOW.I wanted to scream,I get it! Daniel and Luce are inlustlove. BUT WHY? WHY???I'm still at a loss about what I was supposed to learn from this book. That Daniel and Luce are the most selfish couple of all time? That instalove trumps all?You think it's bad reading about ONE Luce? Trying reading about a dozen Luces through the centuries. And hello? The gargoyle? What was Luce thinking?Ugh. That's all I can say after slogging through this book.
