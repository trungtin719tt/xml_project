I might have enjoyed this one more if Sookie was a bit more relatable. In a paranormal romance, the reader is supposed to be able to project themselves into the main character, right? I mean, we pretend like that's not the point but that's kinda sorta really the point.But Sookie is so emotionally distant and half the time I can't even tell if she's happy or sad or angry or what. Her motivations are hard to decipher from the text.Perhaps I misjudged the intent of the book; maybe it was written more as a murder-mystery than a PNR flick. But, having watched True Blood before starting this series, my expectations going in were of steaminess and drama with a little spicy mystery mixed in. I was left a little disappointed.However I'm still soldiering on with the series becauseTHISMMMMmmmmmmmm. I want to get to know Charlaine's version of Eric Northman.
