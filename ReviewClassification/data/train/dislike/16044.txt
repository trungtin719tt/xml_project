I absolutely hated this book. HATED it. I'm not sure I've ever been able to say that about a novel before, but I can honestly say that about this one. Being a long-time fan of vampires, I picked this up at Barnes &amp; Noble thinking that it might be a quick, easy, interesting read. The book itself is not terribly long, but I had a hard time getting through it.For one thing, that characters aren't likable...AT ALL. The vampires are an ancient group of rich, snobby elitists who care more about fashion, money and society than they should for a group of powerful beings that's been around for hundreds of years. They're completely superficial, interested in the most ridiculous, trivial aspects of life, like silly pop culture tidbits, current trends, fashion labels, and designer clothing. The name-dropping in this book is truly horrendous. These are NOT the kind of vampires I fell in love with at a young age, and I doubt anyone could find themselves falling in love with these vampires either.People think the Twilight books are bad? This is worse.
