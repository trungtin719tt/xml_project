blah.... Now, I know that when someone writes a book it doesn't have to reflect real life, but does that mean that they couldn't at least try to make it seem real? Like whatever is going on in the book could really happen in the 'real' world?Do you think that Dean Koontz could have wrote a book that wasn't so drippy with sentimentality towards his favorite breed of dog, that other people could actually get through it?Well, I did - barely. It was soooo dang painful too. All his annoying story recipes were present such as: beautiful, perfect woman; strong, manly (yet so thoughtful)man; and technology gone awry. The point? To save one beautiful and amazingly smart golden retriever (can he talk? Oh, do you have to ask?) from a crazed and Evil baboon/pig (how evil? Evil enough to kill an amazing golden retriever, so thats pretty darn evil). Will you wish you had spent your time doing something else? YES!!!
