There isn't much to say about this novel other than it made me not want to finish the series. Zoe is such an annoying little putz that I just have the desire to slap some sense into her!I felt like so much of the book was what happened in the previous novels that I was bored to tears. The book should've only been 200 or so pages without the BS. I don't have a desire to read more of this series so I'll leave it at that.Also...all the love interests are laughable.
