Read the full review here @A Perfection Called BooksThe Concept:Blue Bloods is a trio combination of Gossip Girl, angels, and vampires. The idea and premise of this series is original and great! Basically the angels who sided with Lucifer were cast down from heaven and now they are Blue Bloods, vampires, who live in 100 year long cycles, trying to achieve redemption. I like it! It's a cool concept :) Some parts of the concept are a bit hard to grasp. Cruz doesn't do a very good job of explaining things and constantly contradicts herself: "So in a way, we are all related, but we are not related at all" Yup that totally makes sense.The Setting:Helloooo Upper East Side !! Oh the opulence and wealth. Quite fun to read of, but wayyy too much time was spent describing the luxury and the name-brand clothing and furniture. Most of this book was spent describing everyone's designer-brand things, I'd have liked more of the story to be about, oh I don't know, the plot perhaps?The Writing:Cruz's writing is fine. It's simple; she writes fluffy, light stories. I caught a grammar mistake or two in the writing. Cruz is great at describing, sometimes she goes overboard though. This book lacks humor and fun. I wish Cruz would incorporate that into her books (please, anything to liven up this series)!The Plot:There is a plot! It just goes NOWHERE. There's so much that could be done with this series but the execution is so poor that it goes nowhere! It hurts my bookworm heart because this series could be so good if written the right way. But alas, we instead are forced to read 250 pages of nothingness and 50 pages of actual story and plot development and movement. The focus of this book is completely wrong. Stop focusing on the wealth of the Blue Bloods and the Upper East Side scene. Focus on the threats, the Silver Bloods! Have some character and plot development. Have meaningful scenes, not just randomly thrown-in ones.The Characters:I don't like any of the characters. It's sad. Schuyler is okay. She's so dull though. Jack is mysterious and hot but besides that he doesn't have much going for him. I loathe Mimi, and her pride and vanity make me want to slap her. Bliss is a dolt. And she's way too obsessed with what people think of her. All of these characters get on my nerves.The Romance:It goes from zero to sixty in 3.5. What. The. Heck. Jack and Schuyler hardly know each other and then they suddenly love each other? And I think a love triangle might be forming? And there's definitely some incest...EW INCEST. I just want to puke when I think of Jack and Mimi together. Bleh :P If I see any incestuous things happening in this series I will chuck the book across the room and start purging. Bleh. Mimi and Jack?! Ew. And Mimi WANTS Jack? Ew. I don't care about the little technicalities and how it's like "hey we're kind of siblings kind of not. We just so happen to be called back to live in this cycle as twin siblings," don't even. That's called incest. Cruz, don't even try to make it better by confusing me even more with the bonding rituals that Blue Bloods have that they renew with that same partner during each cycle... Ew. Incest. No. Ew.The Cliches:There are so many cliches that made me roll my eyes in this book:- The plain protagonist is suddenly found out to be gorgeous- The popular guy who's never given her two words suddenly is all interested in her- Protagonist's mom is in a coma- Missing father- Ordinary girl finds out she's not so ordinary- BFF in love with protagonist, protagonist can't see it even though it's obvious- Unique protagonist first name that you've never heard of before- Spoiled queen bee who does evil things (especially to the protagonist)Overall:Blue Bloods was a bad start to the series. I'm holding onto the hope that this series gets better. It's an interesting concept and a great plot idea. Now if only the execution could improve...
