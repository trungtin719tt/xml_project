Is it just me, or is this series on a serious downward spiral?Eragonwas uninventive but entertaining;Eldestwas a bit of slog, but pulled through in the end;Brisingr, however, just left me exhuasted and annoyed. At least half of this novel could have be edited out, and as with the previous two books, Paolini seems more interested in showing off his vocabulary (both English and invented) and in delivering lengthy, detailed battle scenes than in telling a compelling story. Oh, and....SPOILER BELOW....******.....what's up with the Eldunari? Horcruxes much? The whole series has been a cup of Tolkein, a dollop of McCaffrey, a dash of Lackey, and now we're adding a teaspoon of Rowling. WhenEragon and the Deathly Hallowscomes out, I'm just going to skip to the end.
