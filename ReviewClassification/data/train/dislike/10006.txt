SynopsisPart autobiography, part fiction, this book tells the story of a pioneer family settling in Indian Territory in the plains of the American Southwest.ReviewThis American classic can problematic to modern readers. Ma's meek demeanor and the frequent reminder that "children should be seen and not heard" are not likely to resonate with youth of the 21st century and are likely more fiction than autobiography. Additionally, while the book had a clear beginning and end, the middle was more a series of events rather than a clear narrative. However, the detailed descriptions of pioneer daily life, perils and methods of creating creature comforts are interesting in a documentary sort of way. It's almost instructive in it's passages on the building of a log cabin and rocking chair. The constant optimism sometimes feels refreshing and at other times feels grating.One surprising element of the book is the way it addresses the issue of Native Americans. At the beginning of the book, Pa decides to settle several miles into Indian Territory with assurances from the U.S. government that it will soon be opened to settlers. This creates tension with the Osage Indians living in the area. The feeling of manifest destiny and fear of Native Americans is realistic for white pioneers at the time. However, the portrayals of Native Americans tend toward stereotypes of noble savage and wildman. The tension over land and culture is felt periodically throughout the book and brings about the eventual climax, though it is simplified through a six year old's eyes.This book is a must for any juvenile collection. It is entertaining and an American Classic. Some elements of the book are timeless, others are a bit more dated or downright offensive when looked at through modern eyes.Critical ReviewsNo critical reviews available.Additional Bibiliographic InformationPublished by HarperCollins in 1935335 PagesAges 9-12
