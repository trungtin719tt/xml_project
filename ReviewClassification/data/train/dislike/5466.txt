This book was a struggle to read. Like a chick struggling to hatch and be free of his confining egg, I struggled to get to the end of this book, it was a miserable experience. This book is as useless to me as the chick's empty shell is to him. Thankfully this reading struggle for me is over, and I too am now free. The writing was verbose and dictatorial. That is not to say that while reading there were not moments of solid reading enjoyment. However, for the benefit of several paragraphs of greatness, this book is just not worth the time it takes to read .
