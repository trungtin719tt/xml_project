I find one of the great benefits of teaching is being able to buy/read ya lit without having to justify to myself its literary merit (I'm buying it for my classroom library; I'm reading it for research). Much of the YA Lit that I read though, is, in fact, well written, intelligent, thought-provoking pieces of literature. TheMaximum Rideseries was certainly never that. While I enjoyed the first twoMaximum Ridebooks (The Angel ExperimentandSchool's Out Forever), they are certainly brain candy. I know it's full of sugar and empty calories, but its just so addicting to read something interesting without actually having to think about it. Unfortunately,Maximum Ride: Saving the World and other Extreme Sportslacks any substance what-so-ever. Its the equivilant to eating cubes of sugar. The other plots, while predictable, were at least plausible (in a bird-avian-hybrids-fighting-to-save-the-world-is-normal sort of way). The style of writing, while cute in the first two books, is now extremely annoying. What was, at first, an attempt to sound authentic, is now appearing a desperate attempt to sound young. This book gives in to all the YA Lit stereotypes of fluff books without any literary merit. I don't think you need to dumb down literature to get kids to like it. This book is an insult to all 14-year-old kids with wings everywhere.
