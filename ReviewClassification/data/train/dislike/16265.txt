Rating: 2* of fiveThe Publisher Says: The national bestseller and the first volume in Cormac McCarthy's Border Trilogy,All the Pretty Horsesis the tale of John Grady Cole, who at sixteen finds himself at the end of a long line of Texas ranchers, cut off from the only life he has ever imagined for himself. With two companions, he sets off for Mexico on a sometimes idyllic, sometimes comic journey to a place where dreams are paid for in blood. Winner of the National Book Award for Fiction.My Review: The Doubleday UK meme,a book a day for July 2014, is the goad I'm using to get through my snit-based unwritten reviews. Today's prompt is to discuss the "most chocolatey novel" for National Chocolate Day.I hate chocolate, and I hated this pretentious self-conscious poseur of a novel.I dont think omitting punctuation is novel since thenouveau romanmovement has been doing it since oh I dunno the 1950s AND its pretty much pointless in telling a standard coming-of-age story AND it's an absurd (and inconsistently utilized) affectation whose cynical deployment in this violent animal-abusive Peckinpahesque farrago won the author a National Book AwardWhich is not to say that McCarthy can't write very nice lines:Between the wish and the thing the world lies waiting.--lovely and preciseScars have the strange power to remind us that our past is real.--amen to that oneBut that isn't enough to make a book a Modern Classic! A triumph! A brilliant (overused word) novel!It's a very basic coming-of-age-in-the-West story featuring a blah little boy who becomes a Man because shit happens. Where it isn't tedious it's nauseous. The pornographically sensual descriptions of guns and blood and cruelty are, for this reader at least, off-putting.Take away the "difficult" "innovative" (really? eighty years afterUlyssesand we're calling this crap-fest difficult and innovative?) stylistic quirks and what do you have?A Louis L'Amour novel written by DH Lawrence.How horrible is that.
