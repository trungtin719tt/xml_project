By my calculation, Annie Proulx owes me close to $20, and several unrecoverable hours of my life. Not only did I buy and read this wretched book, but - inexplicably - I forked out another $7 to go see the equally wretched movie. I suppose I have only myself to blame for the latter exercise in misjudgement, given that I knew in advance how appallingly bleak the book was, and that it involved the wretchedly vile Kevin Spacey.gaaaaah!OK, so Annie P. achieves partial redemption through having written "Brokeback Mountain". Spacey still has his own special reserved circle of hell, though, if there is any justice in this world, or the next.
