I picked up this book with high expectations but in the end I felt that Gaiman has stretched the story unnecessarily - it could've been a really nice, but not great, short story, had he not extended it. Weird - was the first word that popped up in my mind, as soon as I started reading. The second word that popped up was Holden Caulfield (from The Catcher in the Rye), because the boy reminded me of him. I remember enjoying reading The Catcher in the Rye, but this one was not that great and I've mixed feelings towards this book. Gaiman is a good writer but certainly not a great one, for me. His prose was eloquent and I admired his writing skills but it was his imagination that really annoyed me. He created everything, out of nowhere, as if his sole purpose is to defy physics, logic, all of the sciences, and above all the common sense; in the name of fantasy. In my opinion, he utterly failed in this endeavor. Being a man of reason I loathed this utterly illogical depictions of things in the story and I'd to force myself to finish it.However, there is a flip side too. His depiction of the tale is admirable and he was able to evoke many emotions simultaneously - fear, sadness, anger, disgust, anticipation, surprise, and joy. His tale has an emotional depth to it, and evokes nostalgia. It's a trip down the memory lane. I liked the climax, the way he ended the story. It cheered me up a little, and that's why I've given it two and half which is rounded to two stars. But I'm still not sure if I liked this story by Gaiman.2.5/5.0
