2 starsUnfortunately this book just wasn't for me. It started out strong, but by the last 100 pages I no longer cared what happened to the characters. I've never been a huge Nora Robert's fan, I find her romance too cheesy/formulaic for my taste. But I wanted to give this series a chance.I happen to be in a reading/reviewing slump, it's hard for me to review book that were just "meh" for me. So I'm going to break this down.What didn't work:-the plot: it was all over the place, half romance half murder mystery. It never really settled-INSTALOVE-poorly written sex scenes-poorly written "romantic scenes"-murder mystery pushed into subplot in 2nd half of bookAND (don't kill me ladies)...I didn't like Roarke.Maybe I just was anticipating too much from him? All he had going was he was rich, hot and into Eve. That was about it...........................................................................What I liked about the book:-Eve: a very complex, strong female character that is well written. I just wish she was in a better book. Maybe one day I'll pick up another one in this series as there are like 47 of them.So this was just an okay read for me, but I'm glad I read it. I can totally see the appeal but it doesn't appeal to me.
