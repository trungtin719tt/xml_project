Well, I approach this review with some trepidation. A large number of readers here love this book, including a "Goodreads friend" whom I usually agree with...(sorry Stephen, Stephanie, Rose). But I just didn't care for it. I found it a "poor man'sThe Stand". The book is full of stereotypes, cliches and tropes. There are old hackneyed ideas "guns are BAD", if you look nonthreatening your less likely to be threatened, war is evil...on and on. Some of the story telling put me in mind of the old "what would happen if they gave a war and nobody came" idea spouted back in the "wonderful" late 60s and 70s. Nobody ever seems to answer that, well I will. What happens? They bring the war to you...We start out with ANOTHER wipe the world out to tell the story scenario, only this is one where we use nukes rather than a germ. The people (characters) other than Swan, Josh, and poor crazed broken Sister are hard to identify with, the story doesn't really hang together within it's own bounds...it just seems to fail on so many levels. The "Bad Guys" are basically the remnants of the military ("military baaaaaad".). The good guys? kids and a crazy lady (crazy, but of course innocent and nice)...it goes on and on...the characters and plot show the marks of a cookie cutter. I'm sorry all you who love this book, I just don't.I want to interject here that McCammon wrote one of my all time favorite books, Boy's LifeBoy's Lifeand I've read others by him I liked a lot, so when I saw the glowing reports on this one I searched it out. But I just found it not nearly up to his standards or to the standards of other post-apocalyptic novels. Read The Stand, Alas Babylon, Earth Abides (more of a downer), this one "for me" just doesn't measure up...that's in my opinion of course. Sorry.I will be reading other books by Mr. McCammon, as I've read good books by him, books I really like, but this one goes on my to be sold, traded, or whatever pile.
