Warning-Contains minor spoilers!!May hinder your reading experience!!My very Honest review--(fans of this book please bear with me.)The story is written from the perspective of Eva Tramell.Because of her new job she has just moved to Manhattan from San Diego.The first time she meets with Gideon Cross,sparks fly.The tension between them is palpable and theirchemistryis nearlyexplosive.I really liked the first few chapters,which shows them skirting around each other.It was quite good.(So,why the 2 stars?)Gideon says that he wants to fuck her.She is offended to be seen asvagina with legs.(And I was so happy to have a clear headed,strong heroine who does not take any shit).When Gideon asks her what she wants,she says shedoes not want a relationshipbut will like to know something about the person she sleeps with.Gideon agrees.It's all well and good.....Until the first time they have sex in a limo.A connection forms between them in those moments.Gideon,(stupid man)emotionally withdraws.And Eva very,very hurt;runs aways.Gideon of course goes to Eva and tries to make up.(This is where I began to get irritated.She knows that he was emotionally closed off.She herself had said thatshe did not want a relationship,but instead of taking a stand and telling him what she felt,she runs!)The next time,Gideon takes her to a hotel room(he owns the hotel)and they have a very good time together.Gideon is in shower,and Eva is about to join him when she finds out that Gideon brings all his women there.She becomes angry,very angry.(Now,her anger is justified because Gideon means a lot to her and she too wants to mean something to him.But does she confront him?Does she give him a swift kick which he so rightly deserves?Also she was the one who said that she did not want a relationship,only sex.So does she give him a chance to make up???)No.She runs.Again.Gideon runs after her and apologizes again.This goes on again and again and again...At one point I wanted to shout at the characters--GROW UP!!!But really their idiocy crosses the normal level the night Eva tells Gideon about the sexual abuse she had to endure when she was a child.Then she becomes upset to see pity and horror in his eyes,not lust.(Really,she has just told the man who may not recognize it yet but in reality loves her fiercely,that she had been a victim of sexual abuse for 4 years and what was he supposed to do???Jump her.)Well to stop her from leaving,Gideon does exactly that.Still,at night when Gideon has another of his terrifying,somehow sexually related nightmare(it might be that he too was a victim of sexual abuse),Eva asks him to tell her about that.He tries to turn the topic and....she leaves.This time Gideon lets her go.Eva too does not approach him.First,she thinks to herself(feeling hurt)--"He does not want to share his past with me.Well,that's a deal breaker for me."When Gideon does not approach her,she thinks(getting very,very hurt)"Maybe he does not want me because of MY PAST!!"Gideon thinks-"She must be disgusted because of that violent,sexual nightmare.She has not tried to approach me.I'll try and let her go.."Really---It became ridiculous after sometime.Well it goes on and on and on like this...one amazingly stupid plot after another.So the basic storyline of the book is--Something occurs to f*** up their relationship.Eva runs,Gideon comes after her and they have sex and make up and then something else occurs,Eva runs,........By the end I was literally banging my head!Well that's all....for now!!
