One of the rare few books I couldn't finish. I could not empathize with the lead character at all - once he turned into a vampire I would be regularly bombarded with paragraphs describing how goddamn beautiful everything was now that he could see them with his vampire eyes. The forest was beautiful, the night sky was beautiful, the homeless people were beautiful...not normally, mind you, only when seen through vampire eyes.These special vampire eyes might be the reason why Louis (narrator) and Lestat (sort of bad guy) spend most of their time making moon eyes at one another.In fact, that's mostly all I can remember from the story since the plot was so forgettable. Aside from the characters adopting a girl (which was entertaining), Louis spends most of his time admiring things or arguing with Lestat.Skip the book, watch the movie.
