2 stars is a bit harsh, I'd give it another half if I could. It's not that I didn't kind of enjoy this book, it's just that it seemed a little, okay a lot contrived. There is no way a man would ever behave this way...even a good and decent and worthwhile one. Even a romantic one. I just think books like this contribute to divorced women who sit at home reading sappy romances and wondering why they can't find a man like that. Give the guys a break. How does Nicholas Sparks come up with this stuff? It reminds me of a 30 Rock episode I saw a while back where they are trying to make an older Latina woman change her bad opinion of the villain in her favorite soap opera. So they write the script for him to become charming to the point of asking to see photos of the older heroine's grandchildren. Things like that just don't happen in real life. It was good for a laugh on a comedy show. Less good for a romance that's not trying to be funny. That's all. It was okay. Wouldn't recommend it, but also wouldn't judge you if you enjoyed it.
