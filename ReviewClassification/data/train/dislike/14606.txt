A friend sent me a copy a kajillion years ago, so I dutifully read it. I still adore the friend, and have liked plenty of other books she recommended, but I was actually ANGRY with her for WEEKS for causing me to have read this book. This was my all-time "worst book I ever read (to the end)" until I read "The Devil Wears Prada."I wouldn't disparage anyone who DOES like this book, obviously, but to say it wasn't my cup of tea would be...WILDLY kind. How to describe the experience? Let's see. It's like eating a Twinkie, which is bad enough, but let's say that particular Twinkie got deep fried in the shrimp basket.Whoa. Take THAT, literary critics. I'm obviously in the wrong line of work.
