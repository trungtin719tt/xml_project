Read as part ofThe Infinite Variety Reading Challenge, based on the BBC's Big Read Poll of 2003.Winnie-the-Pooh is such an English Treasure, it seems impossible that I had never read it before, not in my childhood or in my adulthood. However, being English means that I already know all about Pooh Bear, his friends and that most treasured English-childhood past-time of Pooh Sticks.It was so charming and written so well, but I found it really didn't go anywhere. I wish I had read it as a child because I feel so bad for having not having enjoyed this wonderful book, just so I could add my nostalgia to the whole experience. As it is, we'll have to make do with Winnie-the-Pooh being a well written, very endearing but on the whole utterly boring story.I love all the characters: they have wonderful personalities and Eeyore is just the most adorable manic depressive I've ever encountered. But there wasn't much else beyond the characters: even the magical Hundred Acre Wood was just a couple of trees being mentioned every now and then. It just wasn't as fun or as wonderful as I've always been led to believe.Blog|Instagram|Twitter|Pinterest|Shop|Etsy
