Remember the good old days? When bad and good were clearly defined black and white. When no one cursed or drank strong liquor. When children never sassed their parents. When no one had sex (or genitals). Well, me neither. But if there's anybody who does long for such a mythical time, have I got the "Boy's Life" adventure for you! In Leif Enger's "Peace Like A River," young Reuben Land lives in the Midwest with his father, who is touched by God to the point where he glows in the dark; his sister, Swede (read: Scout), who writes precociously nauseating epic cowboy poetry; and his hot-tempered older brother, Davy, who guns down two plot contrivances and has to go on the lam. The cornpone (or whatever the Midwestern equivalent) gets mighty thick in this novel, which is sorely in need of some grit and ambiguity. It's trite and it's obvious and it's soaked in the flop sweat of struggling to live up to predecessors such as "To Kill A Mockingbird" and "Plainsong." Every so often, Enger drops a line that suggests future improvement as a novelist, but he's more likely to sound like someone who grew up listening to too many overheated radio plays. "Who understands such hatred as bedeviled that doomed visitor?" Only The Shadow knows!!! That's not even good pulp. Gee golly gosh geewhillickers!!! How Enger does love his exclamation points!!!! That way the reader knows this is sure exciting stuff!!!! The Land family lives by a facile brand of faith based on the constant miracles God performs for them. It's no great feat to believe when God entertains you with a steady stream of magic tricks. Faith is hard, sometimes heartbreaking, work. Faith is hanging onto your belief when nothing makes sense and God doesn't seem to be taking your calls. Enger tries to say something profound about faith in his book, but instead he trivializes it.
