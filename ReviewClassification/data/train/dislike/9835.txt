I tried to finish this. I really did. But when the main character of a book annoys you so much you can hardly stand turning the page, something's got to give.I mean, COME ON. How many guys does Zoey need? It was just getting a bit ridiculous. I was happy when it seemed that Zoey was happily dating Erik (who is pretty irritating anyway, but whatever, it's not my fictional life) in this book. Then Heath pops back upagain.It's not only the fact that every single guy character in this series (apart from the painfully stereotypical gay friends) seems to fall instantly in love with Zoey that annoys me. It's the fact that she can't just pick one and be done with it. Heath's been following her around for four books now. Cut the guy a break. Tell him you're not interested, even if it's not completely true. Stop leading him on.I can appreciate a love triangle as much as the next person, but considering Zoey's love life doesn't come close to resembling something as logical as a three-sided plane shape,Huntedwas just too much for me to handle.Definitely not continuing with the rest of this series.
