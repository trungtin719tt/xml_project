This is the fairy equivalent to Twilight, funny considering the fact that Stephanie Meyer blurbed it. The entire book form pg 1-200 was terrible, was okay pg 200-280, and back to terrible for the next 20 pages.The Plot: Just like Twilight, it was added at the last minute and was a bit cheesy. Trolls trying to take over a forest? C'mon. If you're going to write a fantasy book, then you need a better imagination than that.Characters: One-dimensional, no goals or purposes, exactly like Bella from Twilight. The boys, a mythical beauty and a human best friend, were fawning all over Laurel. They had no depth and were very weak.The Writing: Bad writing over-all. What little avid descriptions there were a little confusing to imagine. Other than that, shallow dialogue with little and boring stuff going on. There were also some questions left unanswered and things that didn't make sense that weren't explained later, like why her mom left her to eat in private. Also, because the subject matter is light, other things found in the book should also be somewhat light. If you write a book where the plot, writing and characters are more geared toward younger girls, than don't start having a sex talk in the middle of the book. It throws the whole thing off and 11 year old girls reading this are going to get a little more than they bargained for.Dialogue: Unbelievably unrealistic. No teenage guy is going to approach a girl he hardly knows and give up lunch with his friends to sit with her on the first day of school. Pike does not have a very good grasp on how normal teenagers work, live, talk, etc. The majority of what the characters did were very untrue to what teens of today actually do.
