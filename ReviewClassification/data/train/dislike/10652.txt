Read this at least 5-10 years ago and thought it was amazing. Re-read it due to another, factual book exposing the idea of rapture for what it is, a non-Biblical idea, created about 200 years ago by a minister, based off of a 15 year old girl's "vision". Yes, this book is sold as a work of fiction, however the writers do not intend for it to be seen as such. The lack of any Biblical basis for this work and the ones following it, as well as the rather poor writing and one-sided characters, make this book un-appetizing. I do not recommend it at all and if you want to read more about what the Bible actually says, or doesn't say, about the idea of rapture, I recommend "The Rapture Exposed" by Barbara R. Rossing.
