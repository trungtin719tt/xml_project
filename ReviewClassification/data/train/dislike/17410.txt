More than anything,Houseof Leaves is pretentious. It does things against the grain just because they haven't been done before, not because they're necessarily good ideas. Thebookseems to take pride in trying its damnedest to give you a headache, and then expects you to like it (unless Danielewski is a sociopath, and wants people to suffer while reading this, in which case I've misinterpreted).Houseof Leaves gives off the impression of a modern art experiment, daring you to say it's pointless even as it flips the sentences sideways and has one word per page for a whole paragraph. Not to mention the convoluted narrative, which can be described in more detail by someone who liked thebook. However, I will say this: it's interesting to note how I stopped caring about the core of the story as soon as its sorta-narrator explains that it never happened (which he does right in the beginning, so this isn't a spoiler). Even though I know it didn't happen, because it's fiction, I became apathetic about the story of a family moving into ahousewith impossible interior dimensions because even the other characters in thebooksaid it wasn't real. I don't know if that counts for or againstHouseof Leaves, since it tells me something about the way I readbookson the one hand, and it also invalidated most of the plot on the other.One of the three sorta-narrators uses an absurd amount of foreign languages and obscure quotes (also possibly fake) to drag the story down even further, and to top it off, there's the first guy who frequently interrupts with random stories about his sex life. Maybe Danielewski wants us to envy the tattoo artist that lives like a rock star, or maybe he wants to convince us that he's not a square by breaking up all the academic nonsense that makes up about half thebook, but either way it feels forced and unnecessary. By the way, as far as I can tell, there's no explanation for why this fake story of a Twilight Zonehouseis driving the tattoo artist, Johnny, slowly insane. Admittedly, I didn't finish thebook, but I haven't found an explanation elsewhere, and it's probably another one of those things that the author left so deliberately obtuse that scholars and intellectuals can argue about it for the rest of time.If that sounds like fun to you, then get thebook, by all means. For me, all of Danielewski's attempts at being different and artsy were just irritating. When I get abook, I want to read it, not juggle it around because the sideways words are supposed to represent the characters walking up the walls or something. By the way, did you notice how I underlinedhouseand boldedbookevery time in this review? I'm not going to tell you why - hell, I don't even know myself - but there's bound to be someone out there who thinks it's a deep artistic message. It worked inHouseof Leaves.
