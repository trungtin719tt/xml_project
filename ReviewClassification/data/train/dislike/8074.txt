I think I am done. Every review I have read for these books is right. I am still in the beginning of reading this book and I am seriously considering stopping. One thing for sure I know is that I will not be reading the rest of the series. I am really dissappointed because the idea behind the story is interesting. I just watched a video interview of the 2 authors though and that confirmed for me that I will no longer be reading the rest of the series. I was hoping that after writing a few books the author would start to come into their own and evolve but that did not happen.There is too much over the top drama and way to many "OMG" dialog. The characters are poorly developed and still I don't care about the main character. The story drags out too long. This is book 4 and it has only been 2 months! How much could have possibly happened in that amount of time to talk about? The truth is - not much.I think this would be one book series that might actually be better if it were made into a movie because the characters would have to be more developed, because beneath everything the story itself is not bad. The way it is presented though it terrible!
