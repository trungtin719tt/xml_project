I had been putting off reviewing this book for a while. It also took me much longer to read than I thought it would. Having readAn Abundance of KatherinesandPaper Townsfirst, I can say that Green seems to repeat a lot of the same themes and personalities. This may have been his first book, but it was probably my least favorite of the ones I've already read. (And no, I will not readThe Fault in Our Starsforreasons.)The one thing I did like about this book and saved it from being a 1 star was the bufriedo, which is a fried burrito.
