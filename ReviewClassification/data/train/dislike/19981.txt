I hated this book. Hated it. HATED IT. I can't say that enough, sometimes it feels really good to hate something that deserves to be hated. I think Tom Robbins is a chump. I think it's pretty funny that he attempted to write a novel intended to be taken as liberating to women, but managed to come up with some of the weakest women characters I have ever read about. I hate his voice, and I hate his snarky little interjections. I felt like this was about listening to Tom Robbins' drone on and on about the "great" metaphysical observations he could make about the state of human relationships and the universe, and that got really old really fast. I thought maybe I was being hasty, because people really seem to love Tom Robbins, so I have him another chance with Villa Incognito. Fuck that, not happening, I can't stand him, and I feel like if I were to ever meet him in public it would take everything in my power not to punch him in his arrogant little face.
