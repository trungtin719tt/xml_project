DNF 53%I apologise in advance to my co-blogger Kara (who has already banished me from her life forever for this) for bashing on her favourite seriesandher book boyfriend, but I have to call it quits here.I probably would've gobbled up this story when I was 16 years old and new to the YA world, but enough is enough. I've had it with overbearing, overprotective, controlling boyfriends. I tried, but I absolutely cannotstandDaemon Black. He is such a whingeing child. Everything has to go his way and if it doesn't, he gets all petulant. He also refuses to stop calling Katy "Kitten" despite her asking him a thousand times, manhandles her, tracks her every movement, doesn't take "no" for an answer, and grows violent and possessive whenever another guy so much aslooksat her. Not to mention all the times he calls Blake by the wrong nameandinterrupts all three of their dates - could you be any more immature? Grow up.
