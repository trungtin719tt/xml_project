I'm 3% into this book, and I cannot bring myself to go on. This may be a great fantasy book and I'll never know, but there is so much slut-shaming in little more than 10 pages, that I willnotcontinue reading this. Here are some examples:Beside him - or she should say plastered against him - sashayed his new slutty girlfriend. (page 10)"Trey and his screw toy are here" (page 10)Kylie stared at her best friend and realized how different they'd become these last six months. It wasn't just Sara's need to party or the fact that she'd given up her virginhood. Okay, so maybe it was those two things, but it seemed like more. (page 11)I beg your pardon, butare you fucking kidding me?How am I supposed to like a character who calls another girl a "screw toy" and judges her best friend's worth based on the fact that she's not a virgin anymore? I am beyond disgusted, and if 10 pages of this "book" have already managed to get me to despise both the main character and, unfortunately, the author, I cannot imagine what reading the whole book could cause. So I'm going to stop right here.
