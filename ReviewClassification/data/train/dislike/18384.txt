First review got deleted. Grrrrr.....Basic plot: Leslie seeks to reclaim herself after some very bad experiences, but risks losing everything to the dark fey.This book is a sort of sequel toWicked Lovely. Aislynn, Keenan, &amp; Seth are on the fringes of this story, but the focus is on one of Aislynn's mortal friends, Leslie. At first I was looking forward to seeing other characters in the same world, but Leslie wasn't much of a personality to pull a reader in. She had a full back story, which shows how very broken Leslie is, but no real personality. Her only character trait, really, is broken survivor. What's worse, she never develops beyond this. She starts broken, gets more broken, and effectively ends broken. She makes choices, yes, but there is no real growth there. The male characters don't get any dimension either. Both Niall and Irial could each be described in one word. Nial: scarred. Irial: dark(-ish). Done.The book also couldn't seem to decide what its focus was. Love story? Tough-chick-survives story? Dark fey survive story? It's a little of each of these, but not FULLY any of them. The whole second half of the book should have brought a focus to the falling action, but it didn't do that so much as cause me to start psychoanalyzing Leslie. This was frustrating, as she was such a one-dimensional character that all I could think was, "Yup. That makes sense based on her back story." And that same though repeated ad nauseum because that was all that was there to think. The end of the story is the only time when I felt happy with the story and Leslie's choices, but it wasn't enough to save the whole book. I just couldn't get into it, and considering this was a book I picked up for a light interlude, I'm now disappointed. Meh.
