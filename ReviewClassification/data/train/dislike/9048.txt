2.5 starsI feel a little torn about this book. Can't say I didn't enjoy it in some way, but at the same time I can hardly say anything in its defense.What I liked:1) Spunky dialog.2) Dirty talk.3) Steamy hooking-up - Bones is a very generous, attentive and giving lover, if you know what I mean.What I didn't like:1) This is not urban fantasy, this is paranormal romance. The majority of the book is dedicated to flirting, snogging, hooking up, and love confessions.2) Many complain that Bones is Spike rip-off. Not sure about that, as I have never watchedBuffy, but the story certainly reads like an indulgent fanfiction. It is a mix of non-stop snark/action/sex scenes (guess which ones I was constantly flipping to) with almost no character development or world-building to speak of.Halfway to the Graveis filled with cutesy gratuitous scenes of jealousy, sex on the stairs, and proclamations of love - the stuff that any fanfiction is full of. The characters are defined exclusively by snarky/sexy dialog with almost no back-stories - Cat, for instance, has no friends, hobbies, interests, etc.; and the story fails to create any kind of sense of place - there is barely any description of anything - clubs, apartments, cities.I understand the appeal of this series, I honestly do. I enjoyed almost-blushing-virgin Cat and dirty-mouth Bones conversations and flirting very much. But you can't sustain a book, let alone a series of books on just dirty talk, no matter how entertaining it is. As for literary quality,Halfway to the Gravehas none. Not really interested in reading the sequels.
