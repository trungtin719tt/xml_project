I have to give the author props for a wonderful premise to a book, and after reading it, I took nothing in my life for granted (a drink of cold clean water).I have huge problems however with making fun of the President only to solve the problems in the book ... HOW? Yea ... count on the government to get food for you. Last time I checked, the PRESIDENT IS THE GOVERNMENT! How can we count on the GOVERNMENT for the food if the PRESIDENT (who according to the narrator totally messed this whole thing up) is RUNNING THE GOVERNEMNT!Oh, and the churches? They are all run by people who let little girls starve while they eat all the food. Last time I checked, tons of churches stock food pantries all over the world; not necessarily governments stocking food pantries.Huge problems with the way the story came out. Then again, maybe it is just somebody with a problem with churches. Me? I would rather count on people that I know from church than people who I don't know (government). That is just me.
