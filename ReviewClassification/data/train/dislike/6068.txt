I didn't hate this book because it was too sappy. I like sappy sometimes. Here's what I didn't like about the book.Where do I even begin? How about the cover? The cover makes it look like it's some sort of book about potty training or something. Awful choice.Secondly the illustrations are hideous. Simply hideous.Now lets talk about the writing. Repetitive and long-winded. "I'll like you for always" is just a terrible phrase.The overall general creepiness is another reason I didn't like this book. I realize that the mother sneaking into her grown son's house via a ladder is supposed to be kind of funny (at least I hope it is), but it is still creepy and weird!Finally the overall message of the book. The intended message I'm sure is about unconditional love, the reversal of roles, etc. etc. But here's the message I got.I love you because you're my son, but I really don't like you very much.She sees her son as a deviant. If he's not flushing her watch down the toilet at age two, he's swearing in front of his grandma at age 9. She says he drives her crazy and wants to put him in a zoo. It's when he's asleep, and only when he's asleep, that she can express her affection. Why does he have to be asleep for her to do this? Because it's the only time he's peaceful and quiet and not"driving [her] CRAZY!"
