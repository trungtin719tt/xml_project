I bought this book based on the lists that it was on and the number of 4- and 5-star reviews that it received. I mean, really. Look at the lists it is on on Goodreads:Books Everyone Should Read At Least OnceBest Books EverCouldn't Put the Book DownBooks That Blew Me AwayBooks You Wish More People Knew AboutBooks With Unforgettable CharactersBooks That Exceeded Your ExpectationsQuality Dark Fictionand the list I could not resist:Books I became so obsessed with I stopped everything else in my life to finish.I was sorely disappointed and baffled. The way people went on about this book, I was expecting more soul searching, more...more everything. While I did finish the book, I found myself speed-reading and even ( *gasp!!* ) skipping pages.Even by the end of the book I did not feel that I had ever really gotten into it.Maybe it would make a good movie? Since it was also on the list:Books That Should Be Made Into MoviesI didn't feel any connection to the characters. It was quite possibly the story, as I don't generally read books to live vicariously through drug dealers and murderers. In my opinion, this fell incredibly flat and far from the praise other people seemed to think it deserved.
