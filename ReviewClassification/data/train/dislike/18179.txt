2.5 StarsEmpire Falls by Richard Russo is a story about relationships and life in a small town called Empire Falls in Maine.The stroy is extremely well written and the characters are very well developed. I felt at times I was looking in the windows of the characters homes and watching them live life on a daily basis. The relationship between the characters was so well portrayed and a wonderful sense of time and place comes across in the novel. Having said that I still just found the NovelOK. I think as the story unfolded and the details of small town life played out it seemed to drag on forever and I became bored and found myself page counting about 3/4 way through the book. What started out as an interesting and entertaining read became tedious and I looked forward to finishing the story.To sum up I found the writing and the character development excellent and I enjoyed how he portrayed relationships in this small town. I just needed a little more drama to to keep me interested.
