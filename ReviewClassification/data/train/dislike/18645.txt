I told myself I'd read enough WWII stories, but something had always drawn me toDarkness at Noon, so I started it anyway. Maybe I was meant to abandon it from the start.Try as I did, I couldn't find anything to get excited about in this story. Still, I didn't hate it. Honestly, I wish I did. I felt nothing toward it -- something a story hasn't ever done to me. If nothing else, I'll always remember it for that.AlthoughDarkness at Noonseems clearly set in Soviet Russia during the 1930s, the narrator never states specifically where or when the action takes place. The entire story was like that, ambiguous as hell, and finding meaning in any of it was a challenge. Connecting to it was impossible. It was always unclear what the main character's goals were or how exactly he ended up in the preface of the story -- a prisoner of an unnamed totalitarian state.
