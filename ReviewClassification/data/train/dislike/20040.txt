Oh Katy Evens, you made me laugh so hard today. Your brilliant satire on the state of modern women in their early 20s is an insightful critique of the unabashed shallowness and anti-feminist behavior spawned by such books as "Fifty Shades of Gray." Your tongue-in-cheek references to pretentious pop culture icons, and your commentary on the recent abundance of literary misogynists was riveting. The way you crafted your prose eloquently showed how hyperbole and hyper-erotic imagery can be used to destroy the innate sensuality of a character. Bravo for such a smart, funny, poignant work of art. It...Wait, what?This ISN'T a joke?No way, are you serious? This is for real?No, I don't believe you. There is no way she meant some of these lines non-ironically. No way.You think so, do you? Well, let me see what other people thought.Holy crap, people like this book?! Like seriously? They liked this slut-shaming, stereotype-reinforcing, panty-soaking, womb-clenching drivel? Huh...Well, a round of applause for those of you who made it through this book. I only got through 25% before I gave up. Maybe it improves... and maybe pigs have started flying and bunnies have started conversing and unicorns have starting lobbying for somerespectamong the supernatural animal community. All I know is that I'm significantly dumber than I was when I woke up this morning.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**
