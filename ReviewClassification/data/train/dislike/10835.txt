My wife says watching me readThe Art of Waris like watching Danny DeVito readThe Joy of Sex. I'm not sure how to take that.Bottom line, I'm a lover not a fighter. I started this because I know that many people love this work and say they get a lot out of it. But it became clear to me after quite a few pages thatThe Art of Warreally is about fighting a war no matter what other people might interpret it to be. So I'm not interested.Besides the two things I need to know about fighting I learned fromThe Princess Bride...1. Never get into a land war in Indo-China.2. Never make a bet involving death with a Sicilian.
