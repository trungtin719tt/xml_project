The way I felt about this book entirely changed once I found out that it wasn't a real diary, which provided insight into how much the background story of a novel affects my enjoyment of it. Does it make it any worse a book? Yes. What struck me the most about the book in the first place was the supposed 15 year old's ability to be honest with her diary - I constantly lie to my own, never trusting it with the truth, or trusting myself with it - so when that need for someone to be honest with it fades away as the purported author isn't the real one, so does the sheen with it. The voice is unrealistic, and in many ways reminds me ofGirl Missingas the author assumes she knows what teenagers sound and thinks like. So yes, the change in my knowledge of the back story and author has made a world of difference.
