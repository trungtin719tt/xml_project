OH. MY. DEAR. SWEET. . .I don't even know, honestly. After reading Twilight I could kinda see how Edward the sparklepire could be appealing to teenage girls in his prissy diamond way, but after I read this? This pretty much reads as the Future Abusive Boyfriends of America Handbook.Oil her window so you can sneak into her room at night without her permission! Force her to spend time with only you, isolating her from friends and family! YOU ARE NOT DONE WITH HER YET!!!I was so creeped out. I may have had to boil myself before being able to continue on in life and not feel dirty.
