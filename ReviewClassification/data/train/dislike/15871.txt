This book is based on the premise that everyone has a "love language". Things others say or do that make one feel "loved",they are follows:-words of affirmation.-recieving gifts.-acts of service.-physical touch.-quality time.Personally I want you to tell me how great I am (words of affirmation) while walking in the house with a collection of poetry for me (receiving gifts), make a beeline for the trash that needs to be taken out (acts of service), then come back in and read quietly next to me (quality time) before I ride you like the wild stallion that you are (physical touch) so where does that leave me? Which love language am I? This book was not helpful (as indicated by the shelf it's on).
