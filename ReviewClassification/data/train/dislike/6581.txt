I'm sure I'll get hate comments for this rating. But I just was bogged down by Paolini's formal and dry descriptive text. Maybe I'm just too far removed from the other books these years later. I really liked the first two, I just couldn't get into this one. I feel like the story just sort of meanders around.(SPOILER ALERT) The wedding scene was particularly terrible. It was so long and drawn out. I don't like to go to long drawn out weddings in real life. Reading one was that much worse. (END SPOILER)There were a two things that propelled me through the book. 1. what happens with Murtagh. 2. Do Arya &amp; Eragon get together. Yet again, I feel as if things just sort of meandered about, story lines just got smooshed and pushed together.Also, Eragon was so whiny. It reminded me of one of the Harry Potter books (maybe OOTP) Where Harry's character just got on my nerves. Eragon was on my nerves throughout the book. I felt like he was sort of having himself a little pity party.Maybe this is all because Paolini is so young and started these books so young. The first book was sort of carefree for me. It was fun and exciting. The second began the bogged down descriptive nature of what has apparently become Paolini's adult style. It's very disappointing.Perhaps if the book lost about a third of it's over descriptive text it would have been a much better, and tidier read. I rarely give up a series, but I think for the next one I'll just ask someone how it ends, instead of trying to force myself through what is likely to be another 500 pages at minimum.
