I have to say that I was generally disappointed by this third book in the series. I was SO excited to read it, but the first half dragged and the second half was just ridiculous most of the time. I'm ok with SOME unlikely siuations (after all, the whole premise of the book is unlikely!) but this was just non-stop. She kept resurrecting characters from earlier in this book or previous books and it often made little sense as to why they suddenly appeared. I felt like the last 200 pages were the foundation for the next Pirates of Caribbean movie - adventure! danger! love!. It was definitely MUCH longer than it needed to be. I felt like she kept adding these ridiculous situations just to make it a longer book but not for the purpose of the story.I'm really not sure I can go on to the 4th book --don't really see the point. But I am just a bit curious if its gets better?
