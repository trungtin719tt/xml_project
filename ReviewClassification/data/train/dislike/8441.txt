Overall, I was disappointed by this book. It could have been amazing, but Guterson doesn't seem to be able to create a compelling story or fully flesh out his characters. His greatest strength may be his ability to convey place - not in his occasionally overwrought, almost painfully flowery metaphors and similes, but in the rare moments where he captures the essence of the Pacific northwest in small but important details, simply stated. His language is evocative and moody, and there's no question that he knows what he wants to accomplish through his setting.His characters, though, are another thing. The major players - Ishmael, Hatsue - are pretty fully formed and complex. Though the end of the book doesn't find them obviously transformed, this is for the best because it's truest to who they are. The rest of the characters are mostly embarrassingly stock stereotypes of 'town folk'.The book moved slowly, which didn't bother me too much, but the resolution was underwhelming. It would have been problematic in many ways for Guterson to give us a ending like "the whole town learned an important lesson about diversity and tolerance" but at least that would have been an ending. The story ends timidly, afraid to explore anything too daring.
