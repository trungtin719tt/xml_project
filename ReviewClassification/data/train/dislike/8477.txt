Oh. my. gosh. WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY???????!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!??!?!?!?Rick Riordan you are a cruel man! Why must we wait a whole year!!!!!! you no longer have to write the Kane Chronicles!!!!!! grrrrrrrrr....(view spoiler)[ First off, TMOA is an awesome book. I think its the best one yet. it's a lot darker than the other books but that added to the awesomeness. It is a whole lot longer (yay!) than the other books. RR keeps making them longer so hopefully THOH will be like 698 pages.Percy and Annabeth get back together!!!!!Finally! TLH and TSON were torture!The cliffhanger was AWFULL! the last scene of the book was so sweet and sad and then it was like "Percy and Annabeth fall into Tartarus. the end" I have to know what happens! hopefully RR will write another book like the Dimigod Diaries to tide us over.Hopes and Predictions for THOH-Nico. the poor kid has been in the picture since The Titan's Curse, doesn't he deserve to narrate?-Clarisse. whatever happened to her? at some point I would like to know the rest of her story-Reyna. She should narrate too! and she and Leo should totally fall in love. that solves both love triangles and gives poor Leo a girlfriend-Piper should NOT narrate. She is just annoying when she narrates. I dont mind her when shes not constantly talking in my head.-NO MORE PROBLEMS!!!!!! Percy and Annabeth in Tartarus is just cruel!-I have to know what happens to Annabeth and Percy!!!! Gah! its driving me crazy! they're falling into tartarus, have no weapons, and Annabeth has a broken ankle. IT HAS OT BE RESOLVED! One of them has to narrate!-I really want to know whats happened to Grover. HE ISN'T EVEN MENTIONED!!!!!!!!!!! I miss him! the next one should at least say how he's doing!-Thalia needs to be in this one too. She should come and help Percy and Annabeth open the doors from the inside because seriously, how can just the two of them open the doors from the in Tartarus where it's very very very very very dangerous, much more dangerous than the outside, if it takes like 10 people to open them from the outside?!?! I mean come on!-Percy and Annabeth should meet some monster in Tartarus that decides it wants to fight with the gods and it should help them get out. this is way out there but it would be cool-Percy should have a little sister that he never knew about that is Roman. this is also out there but it would be SO STINKIN COOL!-Annabeth should find her dagger. It's so important! she always has her dagger! and her hat needs to be fixed too. I mean she's practically not Annabeth without her dagger and hat!-Rick Riordan will end on another, worse, cliff hanger. period. it will definitely happen. no questions asked. because Mr. Riordan enjoys torturing his fans with awful cliffhanger endings and then making us wait a whole year before he resolves them. if you think that he will end when it is all resolved and everyone is safe...-RR will surprise us and let the book come out in the spring. this will probably not happen *sigh* but I can dream!This is all my personal opinion(hide spoiler)]AHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!! I can't wait! Mr. Riordan HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRYHURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY HURRY! please :)another whole year... *moan* oh well, I will just read TMOA over and over again until then :)
