WORST. ENDING. EVER.I mean, seriously? The happiest ending possible is for everyone to die and go to heaven? At first I thought that since Susan had stopped believing in Narnia and Aslan, she didn't get to go to "heaven", but then I realised she wasn't actually on the train so she's still alive. How absolutely horrible, losing her siblings and her parents. But you know, better that than being dead. Sorry, C.S. Lewis, I'm not converted.
