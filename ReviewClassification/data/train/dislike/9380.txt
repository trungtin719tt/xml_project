One of the few things I like about this book is the wits and sense of humor, and some of the characters manage to make me laugh, but I admit I would have been a lot happier with this book if only I could pretend it's a story about any one of the other Darkhunter and not Acheron himself.IhateAcheron's sorry ass backstory---it took at least 400 pages before his torment comes to an end and I can't stand a second of it---not because I feel sorry for Acheron but because the long series of torments bores me to tear and this part of the story has no sense of humor, and without humor, Sherrilyn Kenyon's novel is NOTHING.Another downside of the book is that it's so filled with cliches and people are acting quite unrealistically.Of coursethe female lead has to be a virgin before she meets Acheron,of coursenot only an adult woman would never have sex before she meets THE ONE, she also had never done anything about her sexual needs like jerking off or staring at porno or writing smut fanfics, etc.Of coursethe male and female leads have to have unbelievably amazing sex together,of coursewhen a man is horny, all he can think of is to pin a woman on the wall/bed/floor/whatever and ravish her...cliches like these go on and on and on. I can't stand it.I'm so sick of these cliches, in every single romance novel, it has to be a VIRGIN WOMAN having sex ONLY with the male lead. How about a VIRGIN MAN getting it on with an experienced woman!? How about two NON-VIRGINS finding true love and having awesome sex!? No, we have no such luck.For most of the time both Acheron and Tory are boring as fxxk, they're good, they are brave, caring, full of kindness and acceptance and they are just wonderful---who wants to read boring characters like these!?Oh no, Acheron isn't perfect, he really isn't. It had taken him 11,000 years to grow a backbone and said no to his abusers. It's laughable.By the way, the goddess whom Acheron first fell in love with as a mortal is being painted into so big a total bitch that I think she isn't making much sense.(view spoiler)[ Acheron is like, the most dangerous creature on earth and the goddess still treated him like crap, beating and humiliating him like no tomorrow? How stupid can she be?(hide spoiler)]Plus, by the end of the story,(view spoiler)[ Acheron nearly kills Tory by draining her of all her blood, but she acts like it's no big deal, she doesn't even act as though she's scared---I'm sorry. But as a mortal, DYING is not okay, you know!(hide spoiler)]If you felt like having lot of LOLs, eyes-rolling and unable-to-suppress-your-disbelief, and if you are ready to see Acheron---the once mysterious, interesting and attractive character of the Darkhunter series be ruined right before your eyes, read this book.
