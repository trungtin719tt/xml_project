I'm listening to this one. I'm about half way and getting annoyed by how clueless and self-absorbed Ever is. She has a right to be in the beginning, but the time has passed for her to "wake" up. Plus she's mean to her little sister, considering what happened to Riley, she should be A LOT nicer.I'm willing to keep listening. The actress/reader is excellent and I'm thinking that I might not have lasted this long if I were reading the book...but that's a hard one to call :)Ugh - I did finish and it was a struggle - between the villian's monologing and Ever's flip floping and whining, I almost called it quits a number of times. By the end I was routing for Drina (not a spoiler because...duh!). Needless to say, I won't be reading any more.
