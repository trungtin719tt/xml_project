After reading the first story I felt I might not be quite brilliant enough to read Borges works though I was able to appreciate the story itself. After trying to work my way through the next two stories, I felt these were obscure and abstruse. I don't have the time or patience to devote to the detailed reading which is apparently required in order to fully comprehend them or follow the inner workings. I tried one more but then realized I have shelves full of books and libraries also available to me loaded with works I'm really anxious to begin. I will not be finishing Ficciones.I have no idea about a rating. I'm unsure about giving it 1 star. Maybe at another time in my life I might like it a bit more. For now, I'm going to leave it blank.
