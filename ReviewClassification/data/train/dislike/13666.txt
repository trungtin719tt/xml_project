DNF - 25%Consider checking outTatiana's reviewbefore reading this book, as I should have done. Because there's nothing terribly wrong withRuby Redother than the fact that it feels very young and immature. I think I would have loved this about 10 years ago, but now the silliness and mental age of the narrator is off-putting.The characters are in their mid-to-late teens but all of them feel like middle school kids. Take these two early scenes:Mr Whitman took Gordon's test back from him, turned a page, and read out, "Elizabeth I was so ugly that she couldn't get a husband. So everyone called her the Ugly Virgin."The class giggled.And:"Lesley thinks it may be a good thing that James died young. With a name like Pympoole-Bothame, how would he ever have found a wife?" I said, after making sure James was out of hearing distance. "I mean, who'd marry a man with a name that sounds like Pimple-Bottom?"The dialogue was all a bit inane.
