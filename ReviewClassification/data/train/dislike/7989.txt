June 15 Buddy Read with Steven and Melissa!2-2.5 starsIn comparison with Angels &amp; Demons and the Da Vinci Code, this book was disappointing to say the least. The ending felt extremely anticlimactic, and overall the book dragged ass and there were whole sections where I'm pretty sure I either spaced out or could have spaced out and not noticed a thing. I figured out the BIG REVEAL before the halfway mark-- does that mean I'm getting better at guessing or is this just a shitty book? Likely both. The whole Freemasons storyline was done so much better in National Treasure (which I'm now watching in an effort to cleanse myself of this book).Okay, fine. We'll go slightly in-depth with our characters for a moment. WHY DID NO ONE CARE ABOUT TRISH?? That pissed me off. Katherine asked about her a few times and then there was no mention of her ever again, poor thing. Nice of you to pretend to care, Katherine.And speaking of pretending to care, I was astounded that Peter could give Langdon a tour of DC and be so coherent after the rediscovery and second loss of his son. Prior that... I dunno, I always think that parents have a sixth sense about their kids. That in mind, I found it extremely implausible that Peter wouldn't recognize his own son in SOME capacity until the very end.And Langdon... Langdon just comes off as pretentious and two-dimensional. Yes, he has a Mickey Mouse watch. Yes, he's extremely claustrophobic because of an incident that happened when he was a kid. Other than that, he doesn't have many defining characteristics (or else the rest get blotted out because those two things are rammed down the reader's throat CONSTANTLY). It's annoying.2 stars, 2.5 if I want to be generous. Here's hoping Inferno is better.
