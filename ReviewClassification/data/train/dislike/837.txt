I'm having one of those awkward moments where I, um...I just don't get it.Look, I've never been good with metaphors and absurdism books. I just get left in a small puddle of confusion. I think this book just wanted to say that adults suck because they don't listen to children. Which can be true. But being an adult doesn't always mean you've lost your imagination. (Hello?? Artists!!) So I don't know. It's either an allegory or a big metaphor or just one of those whimsy classics that are talking about beautiful flowers but REALLY talking about something else. #helpme
