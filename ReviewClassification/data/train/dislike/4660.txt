I feel deceived. I was really enjoying this young adult novel, and enjoying the story of the survival of a girl alone on an island off the coast of California, until I finished the book and read in the Author's Note that this book is based on a real woman, who survived all alone for 18 years on San Nicolas Island off the coast of southern California from 1835 till she was "rescued" in 1853.Since the author named her as "The Lost Woman of San Nicolas" I did a search to learn more about this fascinating, strong, brave woman. Then I became sad, and almost horrified, to learn that this fascinating, strong, brave woman died a scant 7 weeks after being "rescued" due to dysentery.If only they had left her alone. If only they had allowed her to be. She survived brilliantly for 18 years, then died in weeks. Her death is not mentioned in this book or author note at all, which is why I feel deceived. Apparently, this book is required reading for many children, especially those in California. Are they ever told the complete truth of this brave woman? Or do they only get this novel's sanitized version?
