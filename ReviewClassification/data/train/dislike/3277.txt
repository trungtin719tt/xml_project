Today, a seagull pooped on my head.I hate seagulls.But, they say it brings luck, and this I found on the internet : "Your luck runs for only a day. Unless you were shat upon on a Saturday, then you have until the next business day for good luck. So lets hope you were shat on on a Saturday of a long weekend!"Yep, it's a saturday of a long weekend, so I guess I'm lucky!Still, I hate pooping seagulls.
