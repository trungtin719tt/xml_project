This book is very likely made up from start to finish. The events in it read like Pelzer imagined the worst child abuse possible and then said, "And it all happened to me!" Yeah, right. His brother and grandmother said in an interview that it was all rubbish, too, which casts more doubt upon the whole thing. Pelzer also bought his own book in bulk so the sales numbers would put it on the bestseller list -- he just doesn't have a whole lot of credibility. Perhaps worse than the fact that Pelzer is, shall we say, probably somewhat fluid with the truth, is the fact that he's a dreadful writer. I no longer own the book (didn't put it through a shredder, like I did with "A Million Little Pieces," but I got rid of it as quickly as I could), so I can't list any examples here, but I do recall that I've seen better writing in sixth-grade themes.********After deleting I don't know how many comments calling me names, I'm adding this note, because it will save both me and a bunch of other people from wasting time: I'll delete any comments that I consider abusive or that I think constitute ad hominem arguments, so do keep that in mind if you're thinking about composing a long screed. Thanks.
