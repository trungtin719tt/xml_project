Don't Judge Me.I really wanted to like the book. I really do. However I was really disappointed. Maybe it was due to:a)awful writingb)cheesy dialoguesc)annoying charactersd)unbelievable mix of plots from Twilight, Hush Hush and Evermoreore) all of the above*sigh*It was just OKAY for me so I gave it 2 stars. It's just that the whole book is pretty damn boring and I really don't get it (the whole shadow thing and the war thing).I don't know maybe I'm abnormal or whatever, because my friend really love this book and they will also make a movie out of this book. And what was really disturbing for me is Disney will be the one to make this into a movie and after reading it I felt like: ARE THEY SERIOUSLY MAKING THIS BOOK INTO MOVIE!!!(Sorry for the Caps Lock) I mean, come on there are much more great books out there! Hush hush is much even better book than this one!And there's also one scene wherein Cam like insulted the souvenirs made from the Philippines and that really made me hate this book even more. Yeah enough said. Gosh I don't even know if I'm still interested to read the sequel._____________________________________________________________________________Disney will make a movie out of this, here's the link:http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/c...
