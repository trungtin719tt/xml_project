Melodramatic historical novel set in late medieval Paris.Read it once some years ago, it was a Christmas gift, and was disappointed by it - I was expecting something different I suppose, in my innocence I could not even conceive then that Victor Hugo was none other than the fabled Mr Melodrama himself, which is possibly why in his house on Guernsey he had carpet on the ceiling. On the one hand the elder brothers infatuation I felt should have lead to something more psychologically intense while on the other the description of the bandits and of the King with his captives kept in cages hanging from the ceiling of his great hall had more of a comic tone. I felt the book was stuck somewhere uncomfortable between the irrepressible exuberance of Robert Louis Stevenson and the Romantic tartan nostalgia of Walter Scott. Mind you I also dislikedLes Miserables, at some point you do need to learn from your own reading experiences.Something you have to be at the right age or in the right mood to read possibly.
