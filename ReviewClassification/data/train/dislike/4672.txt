I personally believe this book would have been Stephenie Meyer's masterpiece. Edward knows everything so a book from his point of view is just so cool. I read her rough draft on her website in one sitting and kept mumbling, "Please go past the meadow scene, please go past the meadow scene," over and over. Of course, it stopped just before the meadow scene so I was sad. I really hope she finishes it someday because its amazing.
