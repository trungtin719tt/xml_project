Honest to God, I don't even know what the hell I read.Before I begin, you'll realize I've referred to this book as JelliNOE Road. Because that's what is: A NO.Don't ask me what this book is about, because 1) I don't know what it's about, and 2) I'd like to forget this book exists.Thank you.JelliNOE Road has been on my TBR for a while. I added it becauseMAYBELINEadores it. I only decided to pick it up last week because May and I had a deal. She fulfilled her part of the deal and me reading this book was fulfilling my part. LOOK HOW THAT TURNED OUT.If you love this book, I'm glad you did! But I highly doubt you want to continue reading this review.I'm aware I'm a minority here but I was literallysufferingas I read this, because 1) Boring 2) Boring 3) Boring 4) Confusion level 10,000 6) HUH? 7) ????? 8) ?????, and 9) WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON?Listen, I don't have a problem with confusing plots, as long as Iat leastget atiny bit of senseof what's going on and it gets me hooked, but in JelliNOE Road... I don't even know, guys. NOPE. NOPE. NOPE. Literally, the only thing I can tell you about this book is what's written in the blurb and the characters' names.I started reading this book last week, but I was in a horrible slump, and apparently this book is not the best book to read during one. So, I stopped reading it for a few days while I fixed my slump. It was basically over beginning of this week and then I picked JelliNOE again two days ago. DID THINGS GET BETTER? NOPE.JelliNOOOOOOOOOE.Guys, please, someone tell mewhat was happening in this book. Why did everyone cry over it? What was the point? WHAT DID I MISS? This is actually stressful because I had high hopes????AND NOW I JUST WANT TO BUY A PHYSICAL COPY SO I CAN THROW IT OUT OF MY DAMN WINDOW.Also, ZERO connection with the characters (Jonah was okay, but whatever). Our MC, Taylor... Queen of Whining and Crying. That's her new name.In conclusion, JelliNOE Road is my first AND last book by Melina Marchetta.
