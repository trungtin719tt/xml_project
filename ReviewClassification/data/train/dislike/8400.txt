I HATED this book more than I think I ever hated any other book in my life. Zoey is an annoying slut. The Twins are dumb bitches. Don't get me started with the love interests. Zoey thinks that anybody who has even a small dose of sexual desire is a hoe-bag, but yet throughout the series she had seven boyfriends (I kid you not). Talk about hypocritical, bitch. I strongly disliked Erik, Heath, and Loren. But Erik won me over at the scene when he called Zoey a stupid slut and a filthy hypocrite, among a bunch of other things. At this point in the book, I'm rooting for Erik to dumb her sorry ass and find someone who might actually treat him right. The one good thing about this shit was Aphrodite. I loved her sarcastic bitchy self, but unfortuanately, she was shamed by Zoey as a slutty hoe. And yet, in the first 3+ books, APHRODITE WAS NEVER REALLY DATING ANYONE. That was enough to make me want to barf out my lunch. I am not, in any way, joking when I say that Zoey is the most hypocritical, stupid, irritating, slutty, bitchy protagonist I have had ever had the misfortune to read about. Hell, she makes Bella, Luce, Nora, and Ever look like beautiful, amazing, well-thought out characters. If I ever see Zoey on the streets, I won't think twice to wring her neck, because I have never heard of a more useless, retarded character before.
