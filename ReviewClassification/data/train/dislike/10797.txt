Gone is not equal to other books I've rated two stars, but I also don't think it deserves one star, so I guess Merry Early Christmas Michael Grant.This definitely falls into the "overrated" category for me. The writing is... not good. Many long conversations where each sentence ends in "he said/she said" and a lot of telling but no showing. I didn't like any of the characters very much, Edilio was probably my favorite, and they weren't written realistically. You're telling me a bunch of 14 years olds who are about to get their learners' permits have no supervision and would rather walk 10 miles than attempt to drive a car? Then there's the superpowers and talking coyotes and the tentacle arm and ugh... just stupid.I listened to more than half of this book on audio to get through it faster because it's sooo long (again, unnecessary and due to poor writing) and I hated the narrator. Sure, he did a different voice for every character and I know a lot of listeners love that, but the voices were awful. The boys are little pipsqueaks and the girls sounded like morons, and one 13 year old girl had a deeper voice than Ving Rhames! I wouldn't recommend that format, or any format if I'm being honest. Watch Between on Netflix instead. It isn't great but it's way better than this book. The storyline is pretty similar but the plot is just so much more well thought out and honest.
