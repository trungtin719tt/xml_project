This is one of the few books that I hate. I'm a feminist and I love King Arthur stories andThe Mists of Avalonmakes me vaguely nauseous. I read the whole thing hoping it would get better, and it didn't, though there are a few good bits. Overall I found it offensive to the Arthurian legends, to history, and to women, and being a 15-year-old girl who liked fantasy novels did nothing to change this opinion.
