Now this was a big monster of a book.Swan Songis huge, huge like the Xbox. My copy spans 850 pages and is hard to carry around because of its size - it'll never fit into a pocket and will take significan space when deposited in a bag (why it was released by a publishing house named "Pocket Books" then?).It's about the end of the world. Written in the 80's, when words like Cold War were used often, it's no wonder that in the novel the relationship between Soviet and American governments has deterioriated. Soviet and American submarines play cat and mouse, India and Pakistand destroy each other with nuclear weapons, and when reports of more and more Soviet submarines reach the Americans every base swtiches to DEFCON 1, and then everything goes to hell.And I mean literally.Swan Songopens with wild, vivid descriptions of the end of the world. And the world ends with a BANG. Everything explodes, buses with charried bodies fly through the air, DJs at radio stations scream into their mics as cities become obliterated. Borders disappear, and the whole of America (because that's where our story is set) becomes one big wasteland.Obviously, there are survivors. The picture looks grim, but cockroaches aren't going to rule because few of our kind are still walking. The characters that we met seem to be tad a little too banal and stereotyped, but the adventure, the adventure they set on is grand. Similarly toThe Stand, a group of people needs to contact another group of people, while trying to stay alive and not fall prey to scavengers and the lone Dark Figure, which seems to relish in destruction that just took place.McCammon is a terrific writer and the pace he sets up is an achievement in itself, as there's no stale moment in the first section. His imagination is broad, and he shares it with us generously. His prose is unpretentious and delivers exactly what it promises - a gorgeous painting of a postapocalyptic America, and the people and creatures that inhabit it. The story just mounts an mounts and mounts, and although there are cliches and a few schmaltzy moments McCammon pulls no punches and there are shocks that put a succesful shadow on any eye-rolling moment.HOWEVER, in approximately half of the text, the novel takes an unexpected jump of seven years to the future. And it never really regains the thrills and sheer imaginative achievement of the first part, though it keeps a steady level of suspense. But the outcome becomes more and more predictable, and the suspense slowly starts fizzling and gradually disappears completely. The ending reaches just a bit too far into feel-good territory for me, and was a culmination of all those moments of schmaltz which I disliked.If I were 13 and haven't readThe Stand- which has to be named here, and I'd say why in a moment - I would have loved this book. Loved it! But now aspects of it irritate me, especially considering the writer's talent and skill at constructing and pacing his tale. As forThe Stand, aside from the basic premise - survivors of a nuclear holocaust try to live in the charred world, and there's a Big Evil Guy to stop them - the similarities are largely superficial, and save for a few scenesSwan Songis a much different work. Much more...optimistic, much simpler in characterization. It's not bad, it just didn't meet my expectations, as I've read that it's a favorite among the author's fans. McCammon is a terrific writer, and bothBoy's LifeandGone Southare gorgeous efforts.Blue Worldis a great collection of short tales with one sublime novella.Swan Songwas his breakthrough novel from the horror genre, and it is an impressive achievement when you consider the theme and the size, but in the end it went out with a whimper, not a bang, and I don't think a re-read is in order.
