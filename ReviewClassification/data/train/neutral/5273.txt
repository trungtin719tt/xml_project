I was all over the place with this book. I think every star was represented. But all things considered, I think three stars is all it was for me.The beginning was the worst part. The author seemed to have a pubescent obsession with a certain piece of male anatomy. This word was so overused in the first 20% of the book that I started keeping track and even before I hit the 20% mark, I had lost count. I am not exaggerating. He continued to use this word throughout the whole entire book,(causing much eye rolling) but thankfully he did so without the zest used in the beginning. I started this book yesterday, and when I put it down, I could not fathom why on earth anyone would turn this into a movie.No doubt, the writing of John Irving was absolutely beautiful. His descriptive style was rich and detailed. I just wish he used his talent to describe some good things, but this was truly a most depressing book. Nothing good happens. It is sadness followed by more sadness. There are very few books that I can actually walk away from, and since I was half way home with this book, I continued reading the next day.As far as the characters go, they were very well drawn. John Irving brought them to life in such a vivid way. I liked Homer and Wilbur and the nurses at the hospital. By the middle I was hooked, mostly because of the characters and their development.I loved the writing style. That part was a definite 5 stars for me. But I can't say I liked the story nearly as much.
