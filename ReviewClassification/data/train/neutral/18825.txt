Sometimes you just want to read a book with a happy ending. This is not a novel I would recommend to others, and yet, I enjoyed its sweetness."Garden Spells" is the story of Claire and Sydney Waverley, two estranged sisters in Bascom, North Carolina. Claire is a gifted caterer who knows how to create special dishes, and she is surprised when Sydney and her daughter, Bay, suddenly show up on her doorstep needing a place to stay. Sydney's arrival stirs up some drama among her former friends, and Claire is finally forced to deal with some old family issues.Like other Sarah Addison Allen novels, there is romance and magic. Each Waverley woman has a special gift, even if they don't know it yet. And they have an enchanted garden of herbs and flowers and fruit, which Claire uses to enhance her cooking.I must have been in the right mood when I read "Garden Spells," because even though the story was silly, I wanted to keep reading about those women. I have read Allen's other novels, but was pushed to finally pick up this first one because a sequel about the Waverleys was just published ("First Frost").While I didn't enjoy "First Frost" as much, I was content to spend this time in the Waverley's garden.My rating: 2 1/2 stars rounded up to 3
