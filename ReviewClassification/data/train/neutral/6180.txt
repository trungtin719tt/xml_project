Welcome to TheDystopianRepublic of America..The U.S.A now divided, aRepublic&amp;Colonies..each side in constant war..The Republic has certain sectors suffer aPlague..only the wealthy survive and got the cure..The"Elector Primo"of the Republic is the president for his life, his successor is mostly his son..This typical Dictatorial Republic System is already a Dystopian..So, as I started.. Welcome to The Republic of America..Welcome to 'Legend'.A nice idea The authorMarie Lu, shows a typical corruption of the Republic Military government system, just like in some legendary novels from1984toThe Hunger Games.Or even in real life .. There's some elements you can find similarity in some countries even in Egypt, some Arab and African countries, Even China..=====*****=====The Story and the Characters-----------------------D A YThe Boy Who walks in the Light*********************Living on the run, his family think he's dead, only his older brother knows and communicate with him.Fighting the Republic, not for a side, just for ...justice !!?..never caught that's why he's aLegend..Attack a hospital and an officer to get a cure for the plague his little brother suffering..Meets a girl in a fighting club..save her from troubles; she arrests him...J U N EThe Girl Who Shutters the Shinning Glass**********************Living happily with her officer brother.. study to work like him till she hear the sad news..Her brother get killed in an assault.Start working for The Republic in her young age..not just cause her brother,But cause her intelligent made her aProdigy..Goes in a mission to hunt the boy she knows he killed her brother...and that what turns her life upside down..And between the two narrators ,Day and June , The story goes in the republic of America..It was the main reason why I got the trilogy the first place , the narrator is both male and female.. and it was nice.. along with the good setting it was suppose to be perfect..BUTSadly it was after all -for me- just okay..==========**********==========Somehow the characters felt "too young to do any of that" if you know what I mean..may be I'm getting too old for that"Damn I hate when a book makes me feel too old"May be it's because of the "Manga" style the novel was advertised by which makes me feel so..But even the description of the characters in the novel also felt like the "manga drawing" pictures -long hair for the boy, some hint of Asian eyes....anyway I wished for more mature characters or a bit deeper ones that are unpredictable.But the main problem for me which made me see it just as "2.5 Stars of 5" is that the whole Book One felt more like a "TV Show's Pilot Episode" ,just like one episode with some fillers..For me I always like the book one makes me want Book 2 not because I didn't get enough,but because I get enough AND I wanted more..I can't explain well about that but I -for example- like the Part One of Books likeHarry Potter"of course, and it's the best example of Book Ones",The Hunger Games, The Maze Runner..All those books you can just stop after reading book one with a somehow complete story..But it's not that much the case of here..as well asDivergentwhich almost end like this one.I'm okay with a cliffhanger ending ,But I prefer book one would at least gives me a more powerful start..something epic to force me waiting for book two.==========**********==========Finally*******It is for sure very goodTeenbook with elements from older Dystopian novels and even Revolution ones..But for me ...as I said,made me feeling too old.May be my rating is harsh a bit "2.5 Stars" But I'm hoping it'd be up to 3 when I read Book Two hoping I'd even like more and get better rating to raise this one's.I was almost giving this book 2 stars in Goodreads, But for now I'll just give it 3.."They must start giving us the option of the half stars"and I hope Book two would not let me down..Till then..Mohammed ArabeyFrom 20th April 2014To 23rd April 2014
