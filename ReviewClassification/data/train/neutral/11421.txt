3 starsI seriously don't know how to feel about this. It's a total mess.I loved the first book, but I am not sure I like this one that much.I don't enjoy the writing style at all. I didn't mind it in the first book, but in the second it just became more unbearable.I loved the characters in the first one, now I don't even care for them at all.Not sure if I will read the last one.
