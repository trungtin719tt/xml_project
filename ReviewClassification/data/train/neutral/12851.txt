Only a reader not familiar with Dickens, especially "Great Expectations," will find the book amusing, even good.But while the conventions are indeed laudable, I cannot help but find the ultra-cool character of Boris an avatar of Fagan; the tale of two cities revamped into a dull threesome of perhaps the three most exciting cities--NYC, Vegas, Amsterdam; the teenage dawdling akin to Oliver Twist's-- they are, ultimately, safe &amp; unoriginal. Where's the innovation, 2014's Oracle? This is a marble cake novel (the parts are extremely long, but, yes, contrasting enough to be, well, readable), &amp; something a tad... unspecial.In the grand recipe of Pulitzer recipients, the paint-it-by-numbers kind, it doesn't take a genius to understand that key ingredients MUST exist in the beloved monster. Take incidents of terrorism ("American Pastoral"), incidents with goons of the underworld (alas, not "Goon Squad", but most definitely "Humboldt's Gift") &amp; an overlong, overcooked, just preposterous ending ("Rabbit at Rest")--meditations on art, life, etc. etc. Gag. Gag. Gag.To keep it concise (a mercy sadly not granted to the reader of the latest Donna Tartt): It's a must to the Canon-&amp;-Literary-Prize aficionado, and will be lauded as "great." But know, dear reader, that all the hype remains bafflingly undeserved.
