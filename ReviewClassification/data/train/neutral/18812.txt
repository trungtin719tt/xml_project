I read the first six all in a row, and then waited several months for the seventh to come out. So it's no real surprise that it took me a while to get into this one, and that I didn't remember all of the characters referenced throughout. But I will say that I got the impression Gabaldon was writing this book with more than her Outlander readers in mind; the focus on Lord John and his espionage career smacked of crossover. Which I didn't really love, but I can respect her making a play to get more readers for those books.The book is choppier than some of her previous ones, and I believe that if I read it again I'll skip all of the Bree and Roger bits to get to more Claire and Jamie (like how you skip all of the Frodo and Sam scenes in The Two Towers), at least for the first half of the book. But by the end I really only wanted to know what would happen to Ian, and to a lesser extent William. Also she seems to be getting a bit far afield with the allusions to Roger Mac's dad disappearing in time and then Buccleigh showing up in the 20th century. At a certain point time travel loses its mystique when you've got every single character doing it at some point in the series! I will definitely be happy when the final book comes out, and I liked this one, but it didn't have the emotional immediacy for me that the earlier books in the series did.
