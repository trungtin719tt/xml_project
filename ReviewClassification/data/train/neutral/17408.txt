If I may borrow ( steal from Dickens), it was the hardest book I've ever read, it was the easiest, it was the most enlightening, it was the most obscure, it brought daylight to the world, it brought in the darkness of the night.. Reading the upside- down words, trying to decipher the silly footnotes, and the crossed- out comments, making sense of the narrative, both of them on the same page, well you get my drift, some will be frustrated, the rest amused; good luck...All the above is true...House of Leaves, love or hate you will not forget...Johnny Truant, in his early 20's, works at a tattoo parlor, a drifter, junkie, plagued by bad, horrendous dreams, waking up dripping wet in bed, very afraid, maybe inheriting a family curse, he needs the drugs to function. Mr. Truant has many problems, seeing things not there, is one but he will soon get more. Still his stripper girlfriend is loyal and thought six years older, quite lovely. Nevertheless he has a roving eye and finds plenty of women, they like the attractive man.An insane mother who has recently given up the ghost; at the age of four she tried to strangle the boy, saved by his gentle, late father, ( a former pilot who had been grounded because of health) his wife was placed in an institution for life. Alone, a foster parent who assaulted the boy, the marks on his face did not prevent, in reality encouraged him to fight and lose to older boys...Going from home to home, job to job, arriving finally as an adult in Los Angeles. His best friend Lude, just Lude and nothing more, brings him to a dilapidated apartment, an old, blind man died there, Zampano, left behind countless manuscripts, purportedly a true tale of a house that has bigger inside dimensions than outside, an expanding evil, halls, numerous empty rooms, a staircase of enormous size, descending, mile after mile to infinity ?... Strange noises heard, and unstable walls. They grow and shrink, terrifying a family of four, living there, Will Navidson, a famous photojournalist and his girlfriend another celebrity, former fashion model Karen Green, with their two children, Daisy 5 and Chad 8. Will Navidson, is a brave man, wants to explore the building, not a wise idea . The house on Ash Tree Lane, in the Virginian suburbs, away from the bustling city of New York. The big question is this...fiction or non-fiction, some believe others do not, a documentary film is made, The Navidson Record, causing a cult following to develop . Articles are written in magazines debating it, college professors discuss the merits of the case, the pictures are unclear, so is the truth...hoax or authentic ? The author has talent but gimmicks and fads quickly fade , one- trick ponies don't last long...
