I read this first at least three decades ago. At the time I thought it a nice tale, a little light, but with an uplifting message, when most stories were tragic.Rereading it this year, I felt exactly the same. The plot is simple: a seagull wishes to no longer squawk and squabble, but rather soar out in the more pure ocean waters - and teach others in turn to do the same.Like before, the story is a light, uplifting read. I suppose if I were to be critical, I'd say that the whole metaphor is heavy handed and the symbolism throughout is also overtly omnipresent. I think perhaps the story is more a product of its time rather than a true masterpiece.Still, it's nice to see some positivity in literature. The easy read might still impact younger adolescent readers today with regards to self-growth and individual choice.
