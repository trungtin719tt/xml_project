3.5 stars - It was really good.Much like on the movie screen, Ruby's character stole every scene in the book. I enjoyed how her characterization was so vivid and memorable and also appreciated the great atmospheric quality this novel held.Normally the author narrating their own book really adds an extra spark to the story, but in this case, I wish the publisher would have utilized a professional narrator. Had I read this one traditionally instead of listening to it, it may have resulted in a higher rating. The author reads in a very rhythmic, monotonous tone that is unwavering regardless of what is currently developing in the plot, and detracts from the story.I look forward to reading other books by this author, particularlyNightwoods. I'd recommend this one as well, but skip the audiobook.-------------------------------------------Favorite Quote:As was true of all human effort, there was never advancement. Everything added meant something lost, and about as often as not the thing lost was preferable to the thing gained, so that over time we'd be lucky if we just broke even. Any thought otherwise was empty pride.First Sentence:At the first gesture of morning, flies began stirring.
