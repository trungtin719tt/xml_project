*I received an audio copy of this book from the narrator through Audiobook Boom. All opinions are my own.*While I really enjoyed a lot of things about this, I do think that it could have been more powerful. I learned a lot about WWII and the flight crews from the US who were involved. There were many tidbits of information that I had either not thought about or never realized and I appreciated having them brought to my attention so I could think about them more.I really enjoyed the narrator. He has the perfect voice for this type of book. It's the kind of voice that I associate with WWII for some reason. I wasn't crazy about the voices he did for the various people within the book though.If this had been shortened and focused more on a handful of individuals it would have been a more powerful account. It felt more like a broad overview of the war than the tale of the Susan Ruth's crew.There were also a few things about the writing that I found somewhat off putting. Had I been reading rather than listening I'm not sure that it would have mattered to me, but the quotes at the beginning of each chapter were really destracting.This was an informative read and I enjoyed the narration. I only wish it had more of an emotional impact on me.
