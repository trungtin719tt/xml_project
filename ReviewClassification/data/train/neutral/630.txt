I don't know how I feel about this book so I'm going for the 3 star okay for now. I saw the movie a long time ago and loved it, then liked it, then I don't know. Now I feel the same over the book. I love a lot of the characters but I just don't know.And does it really matter what I think?I will finish the box set I own to see if I change my mind.
