3.5 StarsThis was a re-read of a book I was forced to read in middle school. I recall liking it but not remembering too many details. Reading it as an adult, I definitely think it's a great book and a good adventure story.To Build a Fire Meets Castaway (minus Wilson) is what was running through my mind as I'm reading this story: 13 yr old Brian is in a single-engine airplane on his way to his father's for the summer when it crashes into the Canadian wilderness. He is all by himself with nothing but a hatchet that his mother had given him, and he must figure out how to survive while maintaining hope that he will be rescued.I love reading these stories, but they also give me a bit of anxiety since I always try and put myself in that situation. I think, "What would I do?". Well, considering my idea of camping is a working toilet and an air mattress, I would be a goner for sure.
