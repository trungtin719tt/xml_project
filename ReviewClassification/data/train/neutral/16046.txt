This series is basically Gossip Girl meets Twilight. Melissa de la Cruz is obviously a great author...However, she does not follow through with this series. She spends more time talking about designer labels, and what the elite are wearing...than she does building up the plot.I felt completely let down, because many people had suggested this series to me.Having said that...I still want to know what happens, which means I will give Melissa de la Cruz a second chance by reading the second installment of this series.Melissa de la Cruz writes well, but this book is lacking in the plot...
