Still thrills to this day! Yes, it's dated and compared to other sci-fi it will look like child's play, but there's a genuinely creepy moment or two withinThe Time Machine. And by now, reading this is sort of like reading a sci-fi history book!A Victorian-era scientist reveals that he has created a time machine and goes on to relate his harrowing adventures into the future, where he meets a race apparently so advanced they've stop doing anything, as well as a monster race of subterranean dwellers with a peculiar connection to the others.Eloi and Morlock, together imperfect harmony...Wells created a cautionary tale for an ever-evolving scientific world. Yes, even in the Victorian area it was apparent which way the human race was headed. It's that easy living life-style that we've strived for since the earliest invention. It can be taken too far, says Wells. Granted, he doesn't think that will happen for another 800,000 years, so until then I say, smoke 'em if ya got 'em!
