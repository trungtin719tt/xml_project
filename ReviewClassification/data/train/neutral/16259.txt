SUMMARYThe Greek and Roman demigods must unite.Ifthe Greek and Roman demigods do unite, the Gods will be healed.Ifthe Gods will be healed, the giants can be killed.Ifthe Giants can be killed, Gaia may not rise.With a rather lofty to-do-list at hand, two sets of questing demigods head out to save the world.Do they succeed or does Gaia go Organic Mother Nasty on a dystopian world is whatThe Blood of Olympus (The Heroes of Olympus, #5)is all about.So there.-------------------------REVIEWDo you detect a slightly sulky note in my rather abrupt book summary?Yes, I am a tad miffed. Disgruntled.And not a very happy Camp Half-Blood camper.REASONS WHY I AM BREATHING FESTUS FIRE :1)No Percy Jackson POV. No Annabeth Chase POV. No Hazel Levesque POV. No Frank Zhang POV.Rick Riordan, you just denied me the mental upheavels of my four favourite and most loved characters. How could you?HOW COULD YOU?!?2)Piper McLean's POVReally?REALLY?!?3)Piper McLean is a better strategist than Annabeth Chase.In which twisted, soul-seared, brain-addled world is Annabeth helpless?Annabeth Chase. Annabeth Chase, daughter of Athena. Annabeth Chase who fought beside Percy Jackson to defeat the titan Kronos. Annabeth Chase who was the first ever child of Athena to survive and reclaim the Athena Parthenos from the clutches of her deadliest enemy, Arachne. Annabeth Chase who fell into Tartarus and returned. To fight on.And she can't face FEAR and PANIC?!!!!REALLLY?! OH MY GREEK GODS, Riordan. HOW COULD YOU?4)Nico di Angelo's change of heart*humph* and also *p-shaw*.How does gloomy, angry, pain-ridden Nico, who has allowed his unrequited love for Percy Jackson to colour his entire existence, suddenly decide to move on?"Percy Jackson makes corny jokes. I don't like him. Let's move on and find Solace elsewhere."Yeah, not buying that. Not buying that even if it comes with a free gift.Nico diAngelo is the orginal goth-emo child of the Grand Poobah of goth-emo, Hades. What he felt for Percy was a blend of respect, awe, hero-worship and undeniable love. It wasn't a mere crush. It wasn't a fly by night emotion (gaa...unintended pun). It was a love that could have made or destroyed the world. It was an epic twist and one of the main reasons why I couldn't wait to lay my hands on the last instalment. We all knew there would be heartbreak involved. The scene between Jason and Nico when they encounter Cupid back inThe House of Hadescaptured so much of Nico's angst and helplessness. It laid the groundwork for Nico's struggle.Sadly, in this instalment, it fizzled out like a damp squib.You don't just emo and then not emo. Sorry. No.5)No Frank Zhang awesomenessFrank Zhang didn't transform from a baby faced, self-doubting demigod to a ripped fighting machine just to act as everyone's handy shapeshifting mode of transport. You don't do that to a son of Ares.ANDGaia never thought of exploiting Zhang's one fatal weakness? Never? Not once? Grrr.6)No Hazel Levesque brilliance.I love Hazel Levesque. I have burst with motherly pride whenever Hazel Levesque has blanketed her aches and pains and moved like a fiery heroine. I have rooted for Levesque through thick and thin, between Frank and Leo, atop Arion and off it. How could you not give me more Hazel time? How?I PROTEST!And I will cuss louder than Arion, I tell you.7)Leo ValdezNow what's my problem with my favourite spark-plug? He saved the world didn't he? But I don't know why....the vintage Valdez touch was missing. Leo Valdez hid a world of insecurity behind his quick quips and mechanical genius. His jokes were silly but he always made me smile. But here....it all sounded a bit too contrived. Even Leo's epic moment wasn't a big surprise. I feel short changed. Don't ask me why.8)Not enough Tyson-Ella timeI love Tyson and Ella. I wanted to read more about them. But I got nothing.9)Gaia's returnGaia's return was supposed to be the stuff of nightmares. Epically scary. Scarily epic.Yeah, this is an accurate representation.But the thing that really gets my Satyr is,10)Percy Jackson being pushed to the sidelinesYou cannot place a sentence like"PERCY JACKSON'S FINAL BATTLE BEGINS"on the cover of a book and then treat him like an also-ran. You don't sidetrack the most powerful demigod in recent times. I understand the concept of seven half-bloods fighting unitedly to battle Gaia. I understand the aspect of not letting their individual egos and past victories get in the way of presenting a united front. I get it. I do.But this is ol'Seaweed Brain that we are talking about. He is the lodestone around which the rest of the new demigods are shaped and developed. He is the prime reason why a massive wave of the fandom has loyally stuck to this genre.The Son of Neptunemay have been "his book" but when it comes to the crunch, we expect the freakishly awesome powers, the humility and the kindness of Percy Jackson to shine through.Above all, we expect his one fatal flaw to come into play: Loyalty to the people he loves.For about Percy Jackson, it had been said: To save his friends, Percy would let the world burn. That was the moment I was waiting for. The epic moment when Percy Jackson...perfect Percy Jackson will make an impossible decision.But, I had a flashback to this scene:Percy got a mental whack too. Nothing happened.I am very very angry. I am very Smaug-like in my anger right now. I need to move on.-------------------------REASONS WHY I BEAMED LIKE APHRODITE AFTER A RELAXING FACIAL1)Coach Hedgeand his Chuck Norris inspired bravado. Coach Hedge, you are THE.GOAT.2)The relationship between Nico and Reyna.Nico is my homeboy. I have always rooted for him. I wanted a strong sisterly presence to unwind the bundle of pain that is Nico diAngelo. And Reyna does just that. It was heartwarming and left me witha-piece-of-ambrosia-in-my-mouthsensation.3)REYNA RAMIREZ-ARELLANO gets things doneSO.MUCH. LOVE.Reyna is the true shining star of this book. She is (not to digress from her abilities) the Percy Jackson of this instalment. Many a times, I was tempted to skip straight to Reyna's POV because those chapters were unflinchingly good. Reyna can do anything. And she does it with style, heart and dignity. Reyna supporting Nico, Reyna battling alongside the Amazons and the Hunters of Artemis, Reyna's epic standoff with Orion and a personal A+ for me, Reyna's true affection for her horse friends made me brim with vicarious pride.Epic REYNA MOMENTS:'Reyna, get up here!' he yelled.She slammed another wolf in the head and ran. In mid-stride, she flicked her sword, which elongated into a javelin, then used it to launch herself up like a pole-vaulter. She landed next to Nico.'What's the plan?'she asked, not even out of breath.'Show-off,' he grumbled.---'Jason Grace scorned you. Percy Jackson refused you. Haven't you been.....what's the word...dumped enough?''I don't define myself by the boys who may or may not like me.'-------------------------Gathering up all the loose ends and bits,The Blood of Olympusis a good, meaty read if you like an action packed mythological fest with twists, turns, explosions and chaos. It doesn't disappoint along those lines.But, if you have stood, for many many books, beside a boy with rumpled hair, sea-green eyes, a talent for finding trouble and an even greater talent for saving the world, only to watch him being reduced to a fairly competent but slightly silly demigod, then you will be a tad disheartened.I want....nay....NEEDto return to a world where Percy Jackson set the world back on it's axis with a line,"Hope survives best at the hearth. Guard it for me and I won't be tempted to give up again."Give me back my blue-food eating, wise girl loving, Titan slayingPercy Jackson, Mr.Riordan.You owe me that much.
