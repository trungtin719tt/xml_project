i was thrilled by the thought of a new version of Pippi illustrated by Lauren Child. i grew up on Pippi. besides my wild hairstyles, she also taught me how to be spunky and lie extravagantly.perhaps i'm hard-lined. but, certain aspects of this new translation leave me cold. Ephraim Longstocking being a "king of the natives" is too much to bear. too generic to process. he is obviously a king of the CANNIBALS, as anyone with an ounce of sense can recall. also, Pippi's full name changed from "Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Ephraim's Daughter Longstocking" to "Pippilotta Comestibles Windowshade Curlymint Ephraimsdaughter Longstocking". perhaps i'm bitter as i was one of ten people in the U.S. that could rattle off Pippi's full name without thought. i frankly don't care if the new translation is "more correct". you don't change someone's name or their father's profession. end of story. furthermore, several of Pippi's lies seem vaguely racist in this new translation, which was not apparent in the old.that spouted, i do appreciate Child's illustrations. and, although her socks are striped, they are the proper shades of black and brown (not striped red and white). i do hope this book brings a new generation to one of my favorite heroes. one of my favorite heroes, whose father is a cannibal king, goddamnit.
