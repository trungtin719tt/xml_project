Brave New Worldis a classic written to make its readers uncomfortable.It accomplishes its point well. Still, it is only getting 3 stars from me, as I rate books based on my personal level of enjoyment rather than literary value.The characters of this book were not meant to be likeable - I am fine with that concept.The first few chapters made me want to curl up in the corner and cry- that's how repulsive the design of this universe was (mission accomplished, Mr. Huxley). But as we plunge into the depths of the neverending moral message of the story (basically the entire last third of the book), I felt my patience stretching thin.I get the message, no need to beat me over the head with it.I did chuckle at the ridiculous consumerism of this world (inspired by America of the turn of the century) in which, unexpectedly, most characters have distinct socialist names - Lenina, Trotsky, Marx, Bernard (as in G.B.Shaw). I just think it's funny how both of the enemies of Huxley's ideal world - the competing ideologies of socialism and rampant consumerism - were dealt with in one blow. Good try - butcome on!I liked the description of the effects of soma drug on the mind. No wonder, as this was written by the author ofThe Doors of Perceptionabout mescaline effects on the mind - an interesting read, by the way.Of the classic trio of dystopian books (this one, Orwell'sNineteen Eighty-Fourand Zamyatin'sWe) this one is my least favorite (Weis the best, in my opinion, and may have actually inspired this one).Brave New Worldsucceeds at portraying dystopia at its worst and making the reader think, but stilted language and moral heavy-handedness take away from the enjoyment.Yet it's a classic, and should be read, even if not for fun.3 stars.
