OMG, how to rate this book?How can we be able to love a book so much but at the same time completely hate it? It was just so frustrating...I know, I know, I'm a sucker for HEAs and it makes me insane when I don't get them or when it takes too long for the main characters to achieve it. And this is definitely the case here. Be sure you are in a very patient mood before starting this read because you'll get many and many impediments on that HEA's.Don't get me wrong, I really adored this book and I definitely don't regret reading it. It's just that I can't rate it any higher as most of the time I kept thinking:please, somebody just kill all this irritating characters already (not the main characters, of course) as they are annoyingly in the way of my beloved and awaited HEA. I guess when we get to think like that (repeatedly) we must admit the read just wasn't working as one could expect and things didn't develop as smoothly as one would want them to. I'm all about making the main character suffer a bit, but I think this was too much.Still, I think this book will make an amazing movie one day. Probably because it's easier to suffer a couple of hours than 2 days of frustrating long reading, lol.
