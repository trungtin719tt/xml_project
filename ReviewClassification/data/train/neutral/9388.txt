Although I really do much appreciate both the story (the presented narrative) and the accompanying illustrations, Chris Van Allsburg'sThe Polar Expressultimately does indeed feel but mildly entertaining and actually also manages to leave me rather flat and strangely unsatisfied.Now Van Allsburg's text reads sweetly and to a point evocatively enough (but also rather on the surface, rather removed from what I would label as personal emotionality) and so much so that I never do feel all that engaged in and withThe Polar Expressand thus more like a dispassionate and even somewhat apathetic onlooker, with not all that much of a sense of Christmastime magic (and while the latter indeed might well be present, I personally have major trouble both feeling and even mildly sensing it).And as to the accompanying illustrations, while detailed and expressive (and spectacularly highlighting Chris Van Allsburg's artistic talents), they are simply much too dark and gloomy, and actually even bordering on being potentially depressing for my personal tastes (and that is even considering that the main, the essential storyline ofThe Polar Expresstakes place at night). And while I can certainly understand and even appreciate why and howThe Polar Expresswon the Caldecott medal, for me personally, the book has simply not been all that spectacular and in any way special (and I guess for all intents and purposes, Chris van Allsburg and I are simply not that good a fit, as it generally seems to be the case that while I can and do appreciate his work, both text and illustration wise, I never seem to be able to truly love and in any way cherish it or consider his picture books as potential favourites). Three stars (and indeed rather grudgingly given, for if half stars were possible, two and a half stars would be the highest rating forThe Polar Express, as I am sorry to say, I just do not find this seemingly rather universally popular Christmastime offering all that special and all that wonderful, and rereading almost a year later has not really changed this either, and has, in fact, but cemented and strengthened my attitudes, my views).
