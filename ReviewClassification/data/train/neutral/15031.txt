Faefeveris the third book in the Fever series and I must conclude: I'm liking Mac less and less.People warned me I would hate her in the first book but that she'd grow on me as the series progressed. The exact opposite seems to be happening. Sure: in the first book Mac was annoying and completely self absorbed, but she admitted to it. She came out and said she could be totally dense and insanely vain.Now though: the self absorption is not (only) about how pretty she is, but about her self proclaimed martyrdom. Whenever something happens to someone else: it's always about how it makes Mac feel. Mac feels alone, doesn't trust anyone, feels the weight of the world on her shoulders. This is understandble... to a certain point. But I just don't understand why she needlessly tries to make everything more difficult. Nobody told her to save the world. She just needs to find the book. Nobody told her to do it alone. I get that she doesn't trust V'Lane. I reluctantly understand that she keeps finding reasons to distrust Barrons. I full-heartedly agree that Rowena is a bitch. But seriously: better have some help in stead of half assing everything yourself, I'd say.Besides that: the constant rehashing of the world is starting to annoy me. There is refreshing your readers' memories and then there is telling everything all over again. Multiple times.This time around: I did like the ending. Those last chapters had me on the edge of my seat. But a few chapters aren't enough.There are things I really like about this series, but I can't shake the feeling that it could have been more. More to like Mac, more tension between her and Barrons, more reason for me to be scared of the Fae.Again: 3,5 stars.My current Barrons theory.(view spoiler)[ He's the Unseelie King(hide spoiler)].
