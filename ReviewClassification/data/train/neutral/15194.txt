Definitely not my favorite Sarah Dessen book, but I still enjoyed, especially the second half. It was a light and fun read, with an easy to read writing style.The story follows Remy. She just finished school and is going to collage in the fall, so she isn't looking for a serious relationship. Her mother has been married countless times, so Remy doesn't believe in love anymore, seeing how her mother's marriages fail every time. Then she meets Dexter. He is the total opposite of every guy she has dated before.I still liked this book, but the main reason I loved some of the other Sarah Dessen books was that I found them really relatable. With Along for the ride I could relate and that's what made the story so special to me. This book was and sweet, but without being able to relate, I couldn't enjoy the book as much as I wanted to.The characters were fun. I liked Dexter, apart from the beginning, when I found him a bit creepy. Overall he was really sweet and I liked his friend group. The potato song might have been a bit ridiculous, but it was fun.Overall it was a really entertaining and cute read. I can't wait to read other books by her.
