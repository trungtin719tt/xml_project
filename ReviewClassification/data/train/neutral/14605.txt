In 1993, this novel topped the Bestselling Novels List in the US. Why? Check the others in the lists around that time. They were novels by Stephen King, John Grisham, Tom Clancy, Daniel Steele and Robert Ludlum. It reminded me when in 2001, the soulful operatic voice of John Groban made his first waves in the music industry. The market was then dominated by the likes of Limkin Park, Eminem, Avril Lavigne, Nelly and Shakira. On that same year the simple, acoustic yet heartfelt songPagdating ng Panahonby Aiza Seguerra topped the Best-Selling Albums list in the local music industry leaving by miles the likes of belter Regine Velasquez and the local bands Parokya ni Edgar and Eraserheads.The Bridges of Madison Countyis a sensitive simple tragic love story. Yet it is not overbearing, cheesy nor mushy. It is a story ofFrancesca/Frannie, a lonely (but not sex-starved) housewife who did not think that at the age of 45, in just 4 short days, she would find her one true love. The man,Robert Kinkaid, a 52-y/o divorced travelling photographer also felt the same for her. What happened on those 4 days: each moment, each sight, each word, each action, each kiss, each time their bodies touched... they carried with them as treasured secret memories for 22 years living their own separate livesThe narration is simple, poetic yet effective and incandescent. Each sentence is carefully worded and you cannot help notice some symbolisms. By design, Waller knew what he wanted: a simple yet heartfelt love story maybe to differentiate his work from the horrors of Stephen King, courtroom dramas of John Grisham or the espionage adventures of Robert Ludlum. One can likenedThe Bridges of Madison Countyto the description of the tune Robert's friend composed for him after Robert told him Francesca's story:I wanted to keep it simple, elegant. Complex things are easy to do. Simplicity's the real challenge.Like my favorite novel at all times,Le Petit Princeby Antoine de Saint-Exupery. Sometimes, we don't need a complicated story to be happy with what we read. Sometimes, a simple yet sensible heartwarming story is what we need to cuddle ourselves in bed on a cold October night.
