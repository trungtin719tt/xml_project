So far this is the weakest John Irving book I have read. His books are always crazy and slightly unbelievable, but this is the first time I didn't believe. Spoilers ahead. First off all I just didn't believe the plane death. Who travels in plans separately, did people actually do this? You drive in the same car together, going separately just doubles your risk. Plane crashes are just so unlikely that I didn't buy this for a second. I really liked Egg and Mother, but wasn't sad when they died because it was so unrealistic. Too many of the characters in this book die that I feel John Irving is just ticking them off, plus people don't die of fright as easily as they seem to in this book. Finally his portrayal of the family from Arizona just seemed laughable. They took a trip to Maine and saw the ocean for the first time? Does John Irving forget there is a west coast? Or for that matter lots of places to go skiing that aren't all the way in Maine.For all my complaining I did like many parts of the book, my favorite by far was the middle of the book, the 2nd hotel new Hampshire when they are in Vienna that part is great. Although I would have loved to know more about Frank he seemed like an interesting character who just mostly fades to the background.
