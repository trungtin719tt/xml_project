I never knew how many kinds of phobias there are in the world! I might have half of them! LOL... but the storyline is kind-of like Twilight, with some differences but still, kind of the same. A new girl in a cold town, a new-old car, the hot guy who never liked anyone but her, who can't seem to read her, the girl hates cold weather, then she get hurts and goes to the hospital... You see where I'm going with this?I don't know, the dialog is so bad, they keep repeating everything, and I knew everything before it happened along time ago, and Zara is kind of stupid, I mean she is afraid and she knows the pixies are out there to get her but she still goes out!! She could do as she is told and stay inside until the weather clears or help gets to the house!All in all, it is a light predictable read, not so bad but not good either. I hate that Zara is so mean and rude with her mother, though she is quite nice, and there is no reason for her to act mean.Okay, such a stupid book!! With such a stupid ending!! Pixies can fly, people!! Isn't that the way her dad took her to his house!! How can they be stuck if they can fly!?
