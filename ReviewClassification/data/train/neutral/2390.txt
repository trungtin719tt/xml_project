This was okay but not as good as eitherThe First Phone Call from HeavenorThe Time Keeper. It was a pleasant enough story but it failed to really engross me in the various happenings.Partly I think I found it an extremely weird idea of what Heaven might be like. The five people seemed a strange collection to me and I could understand if Eddie felt a bit miffed by who he got! I must admit I started thinking who I might want for my five people .........Putting any criticism aside I read the book straight through and enjoyed it enough not to put it down for other activities!
