Very similar theme toThe Secret Garden- fresh air &amp; country kid causes incredible cure in rich invalid kid. The parenting is slightly better, but still quite distant. Overall, the story read more like an outline most of the time. The characters weren't very deep, although there was an air of mystery about several which attempted to make them more interesting. Worked a bit for some. Most were just caricatures, though. The ending was predictable.The main character was a cheerful chatterbox that certainly would have been annoying if anything else of interest was going on. Still, she was fun in context.About halfway through, Spyri got more &amp; more into a religious moral message that was as heavy-handed as it was ridiculous. It was obviously what she wrote the book for &amp; yet it felt tacked on (hammered) in places.I can see where this would make a good movie &amp; vaguely recall watching it (parts) years ago. I've heard many say they liked it. That makes sense since the story could easily be updated &amp; filled out for a movie. I'd suggest watching that rather than reading this.
