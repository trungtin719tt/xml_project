"Nothing in this world happens by chance."Veronika believes life is worthless. What's the point of going around to meet someone who would no doubt marry you, cheat on you and force you to live in limbo with two children who will repeat your pattern? The most logical solution is suicide. But even that plan fails. Veronika wakes up in an asylum where she gets a horrible news that changes everything.It was impressive to see Coelho make a cameo in his own book. Of course, the lesson of life and how important it is to let things out in the open, take risks, stop trying to be so perfect, and just enjoy the moments (like orgasm), is current throughout the novel. Sadly, it gets repetitive after a while, and I could see the ending coming a mile away.
