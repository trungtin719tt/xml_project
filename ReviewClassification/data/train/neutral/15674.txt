I probably would not have finished this book if I were not reading it for book club. I enjoyed reading it at times, but mostly, I was trying not to roll my eyes and just appreciate that it was Nancy Turner's first novel and it's good for a first shot (although I have read some incredible first novels before). The book is about a woman growing up in the Arizona territories and is written in diary format.The Good: It's a nice historical novel that really makes you get what life was like then and there. It was a fast and engaging read. The romance was nice and the women characters were wonderful. I was worried there would be a cheesy ending, but the ending made sense and saved the book from total cheesiness.The Bad: I think diary format is cheating a little. The entries were unrealistic as diary entries and not well-crafted prose for a narrative. There are so many parts that cross over into cliche and often the book seemed like it was a romance novel disguised as historical fiction (neither of which are genres I like). I thought all the characters were two-dimentional although I do appreciate what the author does with Sarah, making her strong and independent, yet honest and vulnerable. Most of the language didn't make sense for the time and place the book was supposed to be written in--I don't get why the title is misspelled as most of the book is near perfect grammar. I think the author takes a lot of liberties with the history of the region and also infuses modern ideology onto her characters.I do understand why a lot of people like this book because it IS a beautiful and timeless story, but I am one of these readers that cannot get over bad writing to appreciate even the most touching story.
