I first read this book as a teenager, about 20 years ago. At the time my friends and I considered Magician to be the pinnacle of the Fantasy genre, and I still see it discussed with the same reverence today.A few years back I re-read Magician with very high expectations, but found it a fairly bland read. Neither the story or its characters gripped me, and the narrative structure seemed somewhat clumsy.I finished reading Magician, but didn't rush out to buy the other books in the Riftwar saga.At 15 years old I would have given this book 5 stars, but at 36 years old I only consider it to be an "above average" read. For my money authors like George R. R. Martin leave Magician in their dust.
