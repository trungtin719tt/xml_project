I was honestly surprised by how much I enjoyed this book. I tend to stay away from paranormal romance, because I don't think the genre is for me, but this one was actually decent. I really liked the main character and I thought it was cool that she was a book blogger. She was also sassy and a bit unpredictable at times, which I liked. I also loved the side character Dee, she was a fantastic supporting character. As for the male lead, Daemon, I'm still not sure how I feel about him. He's such a frustrating character, he was super moody and temperamental throughout this book.For the most part I found this book entertaining! The dialogue between the characters was often hilarious and I was surprised by some of the action packed scenes. THEY WERE AWESOME. Something that did make me uncomfortable was the steamy lovey dovey scenes, but that's mostly because I just don't like that kind of stuff. In fact at times I found myself skimming over those scenes. :P Overall this was a fun read!
