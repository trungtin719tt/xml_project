This was a delight. I liked the Disney movie when I was a kid, but after watching "Saving Mr. Banks," which focused on P.L. Travers' childhood and her difficult relationship with Walt Disney, I wanted to read the original stories.Other reviews had warned that the Mary Poppins character in the book is quite different from the Julie Andrews version, but that didn't bother me. I could enjoy both forms.Of all the imaginative stories in this first collection, my favorites were The Day Out, in which Mary and Bert enter a sidewalk painting and visit Fairyland, and The Laughing Gas, in which Mary, her uncle and the children have a tea party while floating in the air. But I enjoyed the humor in all of the stories, and the way Mary would sniff and say something decisively:"Where have you been?" [the children] asked her."In Fairyland," said Mary Poppins."Did you see Cinderella?" said Jane."Huh, Cinderella? Not me," said Mary Poppins, contemptuously. "Cinderella, indeed!""Or Robinson Crusoe?" asked Michael."Robinson Crusoe -- pooh!" said Mary Poppins rudely."Then how could you have been there? It couldn't have beenourFairyland!"Mary Poppins gave a superior sniff."Don't you know," she said pityingly, "that everybody's got a Fairyland of their own?"And with another sniff she went upstairs to take off her white gloves and put the umbrella away.Knowing that Travers was unhappy with the 1964 movie version, I hope I'll be forgiven for being more appreciative of the Disney film after reading this book. The movie had a stronger narrative arc and the songs were so fun and catchy that I admire what the screenwriters and composers accomplished. Plus, Bert was only in one story in the book, and he was one of my favorite characters in the movie.Oh dear, now I'm going to be humming "Chim Chim Cher-ee" the rest of the day.
