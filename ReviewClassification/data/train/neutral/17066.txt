I don't know how popular completos is in America, only that nobody has heard of it here in Australia except those of us who are tight with the ever-growing Chile population.Basically, Completos is madness in a bun.[image error]Sweet, sweet madness...It's a hotdog with guacamole, tomato, mayonnaise, mustard and sauerkraut.See what I mean? Madness! But a good, delicious kind of madness.Well, Cry Wolf is kind of like Completos only not quite as awesome.It's a good book, enjoyable, interesting, nicely written with good pacing.It's just weird. It doesn't seem like it should work together. Does the Sauerkraut romance go with the guacamole mystery and the diced tomato action? Mostly, it does.I can't say I loved it because I found Anna's personality shifts to be inconsistent and frustrating and since the romance wasn't exactly steaming I just took the book for what it was. A good book with elements of romance and paranormal.Now this will be a short review because I'm REALLY hungry and I want me some completos!
