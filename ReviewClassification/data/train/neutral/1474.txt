I'm definitely a victim of modern society when I find this book slow. Had I read it in its day (or even as a youth) it would probably be fantastic, but as it is I'm finding the life lessons saturated in every chapter a little much, not sweet. Which brings me to Beth. Back in the day sweet, mild, submissive were prime female qualities. Now I look at the picture of her on the front cover with her empty eyes and blank stares and she looks sweet in a mentally challenged way. And Jo who is endearing because she is quirky, clumsy, and bold while meaning well and therefore not prime marriage material show prime female qualities for today of intelligence, wit, and assertiveness. So you see, the characteristics that are supposed to endear me annoy me and the ones I'm supposed to find sympathy for, I relate to.I couldn't finish the book. I tried, but it was too much like homework. Plus it bothers me that(view spoiler)[Jo rejects Laurie and that little diva Amy catches him with the shallow characteristics of her looks when he is way too good for her. Maybe I'm tainted with the image of Christian Bale in my head, but I still think Jo would have made such a better companion to him(hide spoiler)]. So I didn't even have motivation to wade through boredom to read a conclusion that upset me.
