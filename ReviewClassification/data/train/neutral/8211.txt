This epitome to the "Theater of the Absurd" is about the meaninglessness of life, about the void of nothingness. Sound cool? Obviously--and yet for some reason there is this nagging feeling that this is one of the greatest jokes of all time--this is as inherently anti-art as dadaism. It has diverse interpretations which is perfectly fine--its as if we are all children sifting some gross turd around to see what kinds of figures it can create! "Godot" begs to be made something of, &amp; that is the best accolade I can give it.It is vaguely moralistic with its Christian motifs and religious symbols. The characters, Vladimir (Didi) and Estragon (Gogo) await Godot and withstand the boredom any human would be crazy to want to experience. Here--boredom at its quintessence. Is it amusing? A lil. Disturbing? A lil. It is a purgatory for everyone but the actors who have to remember such lines rubbish and are, perhaps, amused at a world stripped away from all reason &amp; complexity; where acting perpetually lost means actual talent.
