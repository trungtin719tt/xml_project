Hunted was OK, but I didn't have high hopes since I was disappointed with Untamed. I was very annoyed with the dialogue in the beginning of the book. I know it's a YA book, but it seemed so juvenile to me. Do teenagers really talk this way? IMO, this was a filler book. There was not much going on through most of the story. The ending was as expected, but it was sort of a let-down. I wanted more action, I guess. I know the thing that bothers me the most is all of Zoey's boyfriends. I just wished she would focus on her craft and realize that she doesn't need a man (or boy) to be complete. I'll read the next in the series whenever it comes out though. 3.5 stars
