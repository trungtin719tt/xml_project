I'd been eager to read this book, being that I really enjoy Peller's "To Live" series. This book is WAY different. A friend of mine told me it was like Hermann Hesse's "Steppenwolf," so I read that book first. Loved it! And this book... well I did enjoy it. It was a bit confusing at times, but very well-written and witty. Shawn Michals, the protagonist has morphed into another character. It does indeed give one the idea of being in a fantasy. And the book, especially the ending, is a positive one.
