Loved getting wrapped up in the world of Jamie Fraser and Claire Randall. Fast forward twenty years later after the last book, and Claire decides to go back through the stones to find her long lost love.In the beginning I fell right in and never wanted it to end. However, this was the first book in the series where I began to feel it was all a little much. Over the top- constantly falling into situation after situation that all felt a little too convenient. I also (for the first time) felt that this book was too long. Too many pages spent on details that made me lose interest. Thinking I need to take an Outlander break before starting the next one.
