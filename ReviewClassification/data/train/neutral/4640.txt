The book that I read was," Island Of The Blue Dolphins" this book was great! It is about a girl named Karana, and she is from an indian tribe, she lives on an island called," The Island Of The Blue Dolphins". Her father is the chief of the tribe, she has an older sister and younger brother. One day some people came and battled them, and her father dies. After this some more people come to their island, and try to help them, so the people gather some belongings and get on the ship. Her brother forgets something that he really needs, and goes back to their home tent, he comes back and the boat has already left, but Karana has already jumped out of the boat to be with her brother so she ends up going into the sea to look for him, but eventually she stays in the sea forgetting about her brother and hangs out with the dolphins.The Author's purpose in this book was to show that women can do things for themselves, and women are strong, but I didn't know until I finished the book that it was a true story. The tone of the book was adventurous and mysterious, because it contained adventure on how Karana used to love when she swam with the dolphins her hair used to glow beautifully in the water when she came up for air. The book was also mysterious in a way, because the author never explained how did she end up with the dolphins and how they began to teach,nurture, and protect her from other predators. The strengths of this book is that it engages the reader's interest and paints a picture with descriptive words. My final thoughts of the book are that the author was trying to paint a picture of women being independent, and how women today are independent by working, going to school, and protecting theirself on their own. So my final thoughts of the book was that the author's message was to explain how women are independent.
