What I call a Jerry type of book. Jerry Springer. Jeremy Kyle. Tacky incest stories where privacy has been exchanged for fame. The book has much more of an icky cringe factor than Jerry or Jeremy, where the salacious details are part of the entertainment of fifteen minutes of the tackiest, loudest and most violent people on tv.I went through a Flowers in the Attic phase years ago, lots of people did, a guilty, guilty pleasure. I've gone through a Jeremy Springer one too, mornings in the gym. I'm just embarking on the Jeremy Kyle one. He takes things seriously whereas Springer, who is as tacky as his guests, is tongue in cheek. Also sadly, whilst the participants are equally vulgar, British ones tend to be less loud and violent. The producers need to learn to provoke them more.Read back in the 20th century. Reviewed 2016.
