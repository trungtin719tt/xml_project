Wasn't as good as The Notebook, but it was fine.. Sparks has this effect on me of always being able to shed at least a tear throughout his books, and even in times I think that the story is going to be plain he comes up with a surprising turn in the events.This is a story of the renewal of love, of vows, of compassion, and how it is possible for a couple to learn how to love each other again no matter how disappointed one is in the other.
