This series appears to be a childhood favorite of many readers and I think if I were 10 years old I'd be a bigger fan of it as well.Alanna: The First Adventureis a good book that you would want your small daughter to read and learn from. It is both an entertaining mix of adventure and magic and it teaches all the right lessons of perseverance, patience, hard work, and standing up to adversity. Extra points for writing about periods.However, to me, an adult reader, this short novel had very little to offer. Although the book kept my attention throughout and the pace of the story was very dynamic, it was hardly mind-blowing or very inventive. My desire to read the sequel did not appear until the very end and only because I really wanted to know how Alanna's relationship with Prince Jonathan would unfold, I thought that story line had a lot of promise.BUT, the moment I read some reviews ofIn the Hand of the Goddessthat mentioned Alanna's bed-hopping, my desire to continue on with the story completely evaporated. This sort of thing was definitely not something I cared to read about, and definitely not in a children's book.
