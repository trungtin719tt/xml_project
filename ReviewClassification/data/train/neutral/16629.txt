An extraordinary account of Parental neglect to the point of where I kept asking myself....could All this have possibably happened in one family?I first read this book back in 2009 and didnt even write a review as I found the book depressing and relentless. This time it was nominated for my sit in book club and when the nomination was announcedTHE GLASS CASTLEI took a deep breath, gritted my teeth, smiled and thought Ok might just pretend I read again and wing it when it comes to discussion night. But my friend who knew my dislike of the book encouraged me to read it as but this time as a BOOKCLUB READ with the discussion questions in mind and perhaps I may get more from the book second time around.While reading this book I thought about my own family get-togethers and stories that would get told from our childhood days and while I remember very little to the point where I often asked " are ye sure I belong to the same family"? As I seem to remember so little and this is where I am amazed at how much the author remembers from her childhood.Having said that if my childhood was eventful and full of as many odd characters as Jeanettes then perhaps my memory would serve me better.And while my initial thoughts still remain I did mange to get more from the book, as this time I found the humor and the hope and while I do think perhaps many of the situations are a little embellished for the good of the story there is no doubt the Walls as kids saw some rough times and their parents really were in a league of their own when it came to parenting. How you come through a life like this and come out the otherside a well rounded and capable person really does say alot about this family.Overall I found this an interesting read and there are funny passages and moments throughout the story which second time around seemed to come through better for me than the first and perhaps this is because second time around I knew these kids were going to make it and I could relax a little.Glad I took the time to read it again and looking forward to the discussion on this one.
