There's something a bitRoald Dahl-ish about this book in that it has a fairly preposterous story (children infiltrating an institute run by an evil genious baddie, to thwart his plan to take over the world), and a rather light tone. Yet it's also not quite Dahl-ish in a couple ways; despite the evil genious plot the book is permeated with a sense of kindness and is full of deeply nice people (which is good). It's also long and rambling (less good). Dahl could have wrapped the story up neatly and crisply in one fourth the space. My son (currently nine) loved it. I was mildly charmed and deeply bored by turns; my unoccupied mind kept itself busy looking for holes in the plot as I read aloud. There were many aspects of it that strained credulity and common sense.We actually started it as an audio book for a Thanksgiving road trip, but when we returned home, we had only listened to three of the eleven CDs. So I got a paperback copy, and we picked up where we left off with it as our bedtime chapter book, interspersed with some chapters of the audio version on slightly longer than usual drives... Goodness, it took us nearly a month to get through it. It had its moments, but didn't merit the huge time commitment. If my son wants to read the next one (and he does -- before he even knew therewasa next one, he wanted to write it himself), he's on his own. If he does read the sequel, it will be the biggest longest book he's ever tackled by himself. Curious to see how that will go.
