Don't hate me...please.But I'm pretty sure I didn't like this one as much as most of my friends. I'm guessing the 80's were super rad n' all to a lot of people, but I don't remember them being allthatamazing.Granted, I was only 10 in 1985, butstill...I passed my middle school years during this tubular time period. Ick.Most of what I recall involved a mushroom cloud of hairspray (centered around bangs), lots of plastic bracelets, and tons of really loud colors.Not that there's anything wrong with that!Anyway. All of this nostalgia is really wonderful, but I never liked the shows (like Family Ties) that the book mentioned, I didn't obsessively play any of the old video games (although I do remember playing Centipede occasionally with my ONLY friend who could afford a console), and themusic...*cough*...well, it wasn't any better than the stuff on the radio right now.So.While I found some of the references kinda neat-o, that sort of thing wasn't enough to make me flail around and get all excited.And, unfortunately, there wasn't enough meat to the characters to make me wanna cheer for Wade, Art3mis, or Aech.I mean, what the fuck was the point of the story?Wait.Is this a series? Is there another book that tells what happens next?If so, that could change my entire opinion!Well, not really. But I'd at least be willing to give book 2 a shot...
