This was just as enjoyable to read as an adult as it was as a child. It brought back a little of my childhood but made me realise also how much more complicated our lives have become not because they have to be but because we have made them that way. Life was harsh and difficult back then but it was also much simpler and there was more joy in the every day things. Now we need more and more and we are still not satisified. The story of Laura and her family is one that will be enjoyed by many generations to come, I'm sure.
