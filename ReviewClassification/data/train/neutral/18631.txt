An Announcement Concerning the Class Traitor NotAfter a scrupulously fair trial in the Amazon People's Court, Comrade Not has been found guilty of postingan ideologically unsound review. To protect other comrades from the possibility of being seduced into thought-crime, the review has now been removed from the community area. Amazon has also offered Not a course of reeducation. Their representatives arrived promptly at 4 am yesterday morning, and courteously but firmly helped Not to understand her dialectical misconceptions.Since her reeducation course, Comrade Not's behavior has been much improved. She has not written any more ideologically dubious posts, but sits in front of the TV, watchingHarry Potter and the Goblet of Fireand weeping quietly.It is truly a privilege to count myself a member of the Glorious Amazon Online Republic of Goodreads.
