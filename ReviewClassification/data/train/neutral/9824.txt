I remember LOVING this book when I first read it and so I decided to reread it so I could finish out the series (I've read all but the final book). Wow...now as awesome as I remember. Still a fast fluffy read but there is little to no substance of plot and certainly not in character development, either. This is a 2 star read at best bumped to a 3 for nostalgic purposes. I will be finishing out the series because I'm a glutton for punishment and I want to be able to say I finished it...but yikes.This may not be insta love but it's darn close and the whole swallowing of supernatural repercussions with no real hesitation never sits well with me. So many holes lol. Oh well, it is still a fun mindless read.
