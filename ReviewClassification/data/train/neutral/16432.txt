My first book fromColleen Hoovereven though I have several others on my bookshelf.I decided to read this after I read "the review from the author":Miles.Miles, Miles, Miles.Seven books I've successfully completed.Will? He didn't make me cry when I wrote him.Holder? Nope. No tears, here.Daniel? I might have pissed myself laughing.Ridge? Heart wrenching, soul-crushing. But dry eyes.Miles?Miles, Miles, Miles.He's making me bawl like a baby.(https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)It's not perfect; there are holes in the storyline... but the feelings. It reminded me ofBefore I Fallfor some reason.I enjoyed reading this one, however, I don't feel like I'll ever re-read this book or even think about it again. And despite enjoying it... I don't feel like I want to read the rest of the books by this author.
