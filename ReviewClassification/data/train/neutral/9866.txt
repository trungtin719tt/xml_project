One of my book resolutions this year is to read more classics, including some of Shakespeare's plays. Shockingly, I've only read a couple, but ironically I read Twelfth Night at the tender age of 14 as part of my year 9 English class. I wanted to see how much I remembered etc. Surprising, not much.Basically Viola and her brother Sebastian are involved in a shipwreck, washing up on the shores of Illyria. Both think the other is dead, and Viola dresses up as a bloke to protect her honour or whatever. Hilarity ensures as there's a case of mistaken identity, and some bloke called Malvolio is tricked into thinking he's mental.Sir Toby is awful. As is Antonio and Maria. Olivia is extremely gullible, and probably wishes by the end that she'd married Viola and not Sebastian. I know I would have, she's by far the best character of the bunch and has a way with words. As is The Fool, with his dry remarks and witty repartee.Not my favourite, but it's alright. Props to this copy, which included a modern translation after the original text to help when I couldn't be bothered to think about what was being said. It stopped me from loosing track several times.
