And Then There Were Noneis one of Agatha Christie's most celebrated mystery novels, and purportedly one of the most difficult for her to write.I don'tdislikethis book. It seems to be a favorite among many, but it's very middle of the road for me as far as Mystery/Thriller books go.The Good:I enjoy the setup &amp; how this mystery is structured. It's fun &amp; easy to engage with in a"Gee, I sure am glad I'm not intheirshoes"kind of way.It's written well with an accurate insight on human desperation &amp; how psychosomatic effects can drastically warp one's sense of control.The length (only 264 pages) &amp; pacing of this novel is very appropriate. It gives adequate page space to the mystery &amp; the characters, acquainting the reader quickly with the situation so that we can dive straight into the action.The Bad:I did not care about even one of these characters past seeing the creative ways the author would kill them off. They're developed &amp; believable as people, but I never felt any type of connection or sympathywhich I think can be quite important in a story like this.Sometimes the characters don't matter or can get away with being stereotypical cardboard cutouts, but that tends to shift the over into the torture porn arena &amp; I don't believe for a second that is where Christie's book belongs.Probably the most disappointing part of my experience, I wasnot impressedwith the conclusion of this mystery.Right off the bat, I didn't feel engaged with the actual solving of the problem because it felt as though I was kept at an arm's length from any of the potential clues.Call me an idiot, maybe this was obvious for other people? But I genuinely don't feel as though readers are given a chance to make even an a semi-educated guess about who the perpetrator is.It relies wholly on the very,verylast section of the book to lay out the details for what they are &amp; explain the unknown bits.It's very:"Oh, by the way here's what happened."Anti-climactic to say the least.When I'm reading a Mystery/Thriller, I want to feel as though I'm being challenged to figure out what's happening before the characters do. I'll be the first to admit I almost never guess the truth in its entirety, but that's beside the point.I was to the point where I was almost ready to believe something supernatural was happening.Not a great sign.When the truth is finally exposed, I had a hard time feeling as startled as I'm meant to feel because I've seen this story before in popular media. Now, this came out in the 1930's and so this isn't by any means the fault of the book itself.It probably came first in every instance I'm thinking of. But as amodern readerthis didn't pack the same punch it might have if I were a reader of the 1930's.Anyhow, that's another classic under the belt!
