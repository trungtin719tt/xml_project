After digesting for over a month now, I still feel this autobiography-memoir beyond bizarre and belief....Can all of itreallybe true?Can I believe the doctor depict herein holds a medical degree from one of the most prestigious universities in America, i.e.....Yale? Hmmmmm....pretty hard to believe, and disheartening too.Anyway, it's the 1970's and all hell breaks loose when 12 year old Augusten's disturbed poetry writing mother and alcoholic father divorce and mother dear ultimately sends him off to live in the "sagging pink house" of her psychiatrist, Dr. Finch.His filthy wreck of a house is filled with his children(adopted included)and is open to virtually anyone else who wants to stay for a spell. Most residents are a bit strange, to say the least, including a 33 year old gay pedophile who likes to eat dog food.With zero parental guidance, role models from hell and a continual..disgusting..dysfunctional..environment, of course Augusten's life was in turmoil; and if even half of what I read here is true, it is a wonder AB made it out in one piece....physically and mentally.As for the good doctor....Good Lord! An office visit includes a tour and description of his Masturbatorium that patients are invited to use....the crazy Doctor also believes in evaluating his own sh*t to foretell the future(although, of course, he doesn't scoop it himself)........and well, the list goes on and on including the bizarre family "bible dip" predictions, but you get the picture. The smartest family member was actually the old family dog who decided it best to stay on at the original residence with strangers. Wish poor Freud the starved cat COULD have followed his lead.RUNNING WITH SCISSORSis #13 on the Goodread's Best Autobiography and Non-fiction life stories list. Read it and see what you think. Didn't have a problem withEDUCATED(read back-to-back with RWS)but sure found this one hard to swallow. Yikes!
