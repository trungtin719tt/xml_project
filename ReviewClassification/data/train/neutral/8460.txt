This thing is basically 'The Wire' in togas. It has much of the complex plotting, political positioning, warring and double crossing of that show, with a bit of incest and poisoning thrown in for good measure. A lot of poisoning actually. If the amount of poisoning in this book is at all historically accurate, then the Romans must have experienced the same abject terror sitting down to every meal, which we in modern life are thankfully now only exposed to when faced with no option but to use a KFC drive-thru.Some of the story is a little dry, but more often than not the narrator admits that himself and moves on. Also all the us-es can be confusing to keep track of; himus married herus and gave birth to thisus or thatus but also adopted whatshisfaceus who her son by another guyus (actually that really is one.) It's worth stickin with it I think, just for Caligula who is one of histories great, terrible and I'm ashamed to say, occasionally pretty funny fruit loops. Think Charlie Sheen post meltdown, times a billion, elected President.
