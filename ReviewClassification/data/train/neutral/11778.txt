Phew. Reading this book is like being in a bad marriage but you can't decide if it'sactuallybad or not. It started out fantastic. I was engrossed in it and couldn't wait to get home from work every day to just cuddle up with the book in hand. Somewhere along the way, I lost a bit of interest and started thinking about the other unread books in my list. I was tempted to cheat but persevered and gave it my full attention. Some days were great, some days were bad. Some so bad that I skimmed. There's a lot of sex (and an obsession with breasts) along the way too but what really got to me was the fantastical parts of the book. I wish it wasn't so... silly. Yes, that's the word I choose to use although it may not necessarily describe it. The writing is brilliant, the characters are great, but some of the actual ideas, not so much.With all these ups and downs, I managed to hold on to the love I felt in the beginning and guess I largely succeeded because I did finish it. The translation work is fantastic and often made me wonder how they did it so well, especially where references are made to particular words.I think this book taught me something. I can't commit to a long book fully. I am a skimmer and I am made that way. This book probably deserves a 4-star rating at least, and a better reader than me. So now that I am done, I am going to let go.I hope you enjoy it and know that you are very lucky to have a go at it!
