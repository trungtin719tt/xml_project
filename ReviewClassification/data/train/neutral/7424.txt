I really liked this book. It was cute and OH so funny. Anna is hilarious, and so is St. Clair (I always forget how to write his first name). All in all, it was a great book :). Just four stars because the story didn't really catch me until the last third of the book, and I don't know, I expected a LOT more romance, I really was looking for adorable lots of romance and I only got it AT THE END.
