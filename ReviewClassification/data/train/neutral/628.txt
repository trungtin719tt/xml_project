WHOA!!Everyone....STOP!And make way for this young kickass heroine...Beatrice Prior.'Those who want power and get it live in terror of losing it.That's why we have to give power to those who do not want it.'Okay,so by now nearly everyone has read this book.This is a book which needs no introduction.So,I'll try to keep storyline short.(As short as I can for a book of nearly 500 pages!)This books depicts a dystopian Chicago world where the society is divided into five groups orfactionsas they call it.I would have liked to explain how,when,by whom these groups were formed but frankly it was not explained in this book.So all I know is that people who blamed different causes like selfishness,cowardice,ignorance,etc. for their various problems,formed different groups or factions against it.Now,the system works in a way that people of Abnegation rule the government as they are supposed to be selfless.People of Dauntless will guard and protect because they are supposed to be brave and so on.Anyways,now nearly this whole book is about the process ofINITIATION.So what is this initiation?Every 16 year old from every faction gets an aptitude test which tells them which faction are they cut out for among the five.But that is just meant to help them choose,of which faction do they want to become a member of.Once they choose,they will becomeinitiateswho will have to complete the initiation process to become members.But if they fail,they become factionless.Now,sounds good.Right?But...Not everything is as it seems!!In reality,people who leave their faction and choose others are branded as traitors and they have to leave their families behind.So,we see our 16 year old Beatrice (belonging to Abnegation) in a lot of confusion.Her aptitude test result wasinconclusive.She had a choice of choosing between 3 factions whereas others only got only one.Why?(view spoiler)[Because she is aDIVERGENT.(hide spoiler)]For 16 years she has tried to mold herself in.For 16 years she has tried to beselfless.So,of course she will choose Abnegation (the selfless)!!Or will she??Her choice clearly stuns everyone.And now she will have to undergo this highly competitive initiation and extreme physical tests of endurance and intense psychological simulations.Only if she can pass these, she'll belong to her new faction.Tris is her new identity!And there she first meets withFour.He is the training instructor of initiates who tranferred from other groups.He is intimidating but also very handsome.And Tris feels a strange connection with him.(I wish I could gush a little about Four but can't do so without giving a whole lot of spoilers.)But suddenly a lot of things are going on.All around,there is danger prevailing.Also there is the fact that Tris is a(view spoiler)[Divergent(hide spoiler)]and she has no idea what that entails.Only that it can be very,very dangerous and probably deadly.And of course among all this,she has to make it through the initiation,decide between friends and foes and protect herself from a few other initiates who will do anything to get rid of her.So Readers,you'll have to read this book to find out what actually happens.That is if you have not already!!---------------------------------------------------WARNING - Spoilers ahead!!Now,what bugged the hell out of me...The climax!!OMG!It was a series of whirlwind affairs somehow put together.And what was with Tris kicking the hell out of Molly just to take out her anger?? It gave me a pause.And how the hell did her mother manage to save her in the end??Anyways,inspite of all these,I enjoyed it.Though it could have been a lot better.All that said I will surely read Insurgent!!That's all for now,Readers.Ta-Ta!!
