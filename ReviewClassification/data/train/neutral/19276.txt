Actual rating: 3.5 starsReview: better than 1 and 2, though I find 3 the best one in the series. The ending seemed a bit rushed to me. However, the books do read easily.I can't say that I'm sorry to see this series end. I'm glad I bought them as a bargain, and that I've sold them again for the same price.Nope, I will not read number 5 from Cam's point of view, nor will I read the short stories. I'm done with the series :p
