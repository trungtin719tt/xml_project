She isn't my favorite poet, but there are a couple I really like. When I first read her poetry in 9th grade, I admired her usage of dashes even though I had no way of explaining why I enjoyed them. They're one of the most distinctive aspects of her poetry and the greatest innovation she brought into writing. I also loved her daring usage of slant rhymes which angered my fellow students, but impassioned me because due to my rebellious nature. To this today, I fail to comprehend the enigmas which make up most of her poetry as well as her feelings towards God, Death, butterfly's and love, but when one of her enigmas hit home, my lack of understanding is of little importance compared to my fascination with its mystery. A one of a kind.
