This book is on the 1001 list and as a 1001 lister you might think that this was what prompted me to read this book. Think that and you would be wrong. Want to know what really prompted me to read this?I wrote a letter to Mr SonyI said, "Hey S-sony what's g-going down?I've got a record and I reckon it's wickedAnd I th-think you should s-spread it around."He said, "Hey Tim, I quite like your workHe said, "It's clever and quirkyBut I promise you this:You could be clever as VoltaireBut it won't get you nowhereIf you wanna sell discsClever never made no one richIt doesn't appeal to the teenage marketThe teenage market!"For those of you familiar with his work, you'll be able to directly attribute the lines above to the inimitable Mr Tim Minchin. So, Tim Minchin exerted his comedy super powers and prompted me to read a classic novel. Ah my English teacher would be so proud.Candide is supposed to be one of the great satires of period (written c1759). As with current times, Voltaire lived in a period of great turmoil; politics, geology and religion were all highly volatile at this time and it was these tumultuous events which inspired this short novella.Basically Candide trots around the place, sucking up knowledge, looking for answers and finding many harsh truths along the route. Life is a journey... life is not fair... life takes many unfortunate turns over which you have no control... all themes dealt with here.Apparently Candide is a really big deal. Me? I didn't really get it. But then maybe I just didn't give it a chance or properly examine its historic context.Given the recent events in Britain, the riots in London, Liverpool and Manchester I'm prompted to wonder if they'll inspire any great literature. Well, I doubt anyone near me will be sitting down and writing the next Candide or the modern equivalent, but only time will tell.
