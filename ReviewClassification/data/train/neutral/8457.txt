[2.5 stars]Oh, Claudius. I tried to comprehend , but perhaps my 21st century brain is differently wired so as to make sense of the various intrigues, conspiracies, counter-conspiracies, political friendships which suddenly turn into violent enmity,and often vice versa. I also could not fathom your very intricate family tree, which was rife with marriage between relations, incest, polygamy and polyandry. The way you people changed, added or subtracted spouses at the turn of your hats also confused me.At times I was not sure who was friends with whom, who was plotting against whom, and who was killing whom. I failed to understand the plots in themselves.Still I persevered with your book because I found you a gentle and truthful person, and I wanted to see how you penned the history of the then illustrious Rome.I am impressed by your clarity of mind, loyalty and sharp intellect.But I confess that I am still not much wise about the history of Rome.If anyone asks me to summarise this book, I will just be able to quote names - Augustus, Livia, Claudius, Julia, Germanicus, Drusilla, Urgullania (not sure of this one though), Tiberius, Caligula, Jullilla, and a few others. But who belongs to whom, who hates whom, who fathered/mothered whom, and what is the final tally - my feeble mind remembers not.Some day, I am sure I will again read a book on Rome. And then, if I really wish to learn more, I may come back and read your script. But somehow, I doubt I will do that.Adieu, Claudius
