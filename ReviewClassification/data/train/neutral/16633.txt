I talk about this all the time, so here, definitively, is my explanation of the four categories of memoir.1) People who have had seriously interesting / crazy lives, and who also happen to be terrific writers, able to render their stories in a compelling, original way (like David Small's brilliantStitches, or what I consider the gold-standard memoir, Nick Flynn's breathtakingAnother Bullshit Night in Suck City).2) People whose lives are interesting / crazy enough that it really doesn't matter how well they write, because theirs will necessarily be a compelling, original book just based on subject matter (likeI Am Not Myself These Days, about the accountant-by-day, drag-queen-by-night, who wears fishbowls for boobs and lives with a crack-addicted boyfriend; or, yes,Running With Scissors).3) Really brilliant writers who can turn a "normal" life into a fascinating read (like Sloane Crosley or Alison Bechdel or Lynn Barber or -- fuck off, haters -- Dave Eggers).4) Idiot people who don't write particularly well and who have more or less "regular" lives, but whose inflated sense of self leads them to write memoirs anyway.Right? Any memoir you read goes into one of those categories.Anyway, about this book: I totally liked it, but I feel kind of lied to, having seen the movie first. In the movie, everything was just reelingly insane, but so over-the-top that it was funny, and also it was light, somehow, and sort of fun. In the book, though, it's all so much darker, and it made me feel kind of awful for finding the movie so clever and cool.
