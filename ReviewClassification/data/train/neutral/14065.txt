This is the seventh Jeffrey Archer book I've read and, by far, I've realised that his stories are different combinations of the following constitutents-1. One/two young boy/s as protagonists.2. The boy/s being immensely intelligent and able to pursue what they are after with occasional hurdles.3. Drama of Stock market.4. Politics.This makes the books quite predictable to a point. I may have rated this book a 5 star if this was the first such book that I had read, but the similar pattern in all the previous books of Jeffrey Archer made going through this one a little difficult.Despite all of this, there's no doubting that Mr. Archer is a fantastic storyteller. The characters are good, writing is good, and the drama is good, and all of these things merit the 3 stars that I give to this book.
