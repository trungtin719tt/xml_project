3.5 stars.In my head this played like a soap opera so that was interesting.But what themes there were that I could see for some parts: like purity, relationships, and the possibility that everyone is awful in some ways didn't really work for me.In my own opinion, yes, we are all awful in that we are not pure, but that doesn't make us automatically cheaters, alcoholics, or suicide helpers. We have some flaws, but most don't make us evil.Many of us are not like Blanche, a tragedy waiting to happen.EDIT: 3-21-17I have a small note to add.I believe maybe I took some of my anger out on this story. It's not the story's fault so I wish to fix this.I liked the story because:1. It flowed smoothly.2. I never really liked stage directions in books, but it worked in this book.3. Everything seemed to have a meaning. I didn't look for some, but some I didn't have to.4. I haven't seen the play, but I might see it after this if it's showing later.Now, things I believed could have been better (opinions ahead):1. I understand I said Blanche was a tragedy, and I will stand by that, but I can seewhyshe acts the way she does. However, I didn't feel like she wanted to change. She was too stuck on the past (and I saw the reason) and, yes, I do feel sorry for her, but I am unable to try to feel for one who cannot try to overcomesomething.I need thefight.I need to see that s(he), whoever it is, willFIGHTwhen something goes wrong. Or fight for something theyWANT.I want to see their strength along with their weaknesses.That is why I didn't like Blanche, or really any other character. Her sister didn't even stand up for her. So I feel bad for her, but that's it.
