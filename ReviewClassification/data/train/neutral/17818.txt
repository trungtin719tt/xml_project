I've read a smidgen of Lovecraft here and there over the years, but thought to myself, why not crank through more?It took a while, if only because this excellent collection of short story/novella length works didn't really lend itself to a straight read-through.In part, that was because each "tale" is self-contained, and of adequate length to make for a nice little evening read. More significantly, I found myself with only so much tolerance for the Lovecraftian vernacular...after a while, I do find myself wishing he'd find a rackafrackin' synonym for eldritch. There's a sameness to it all, particularly taken in large doses.Still worth the read, and even more fascinating because--while Lovecraft is technically "horror," he reads more to me like a peculiar brand of sci-fi. These aren't vampires and ghouls and zombies, but *alien* thing, part of a natural order that is so much vaster than our old myth-making that it is almost inherently terrifying.Cool stuff.
