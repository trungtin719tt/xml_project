A little review for little prince:Once you get over the hyped mystique and granduer too often hitched to this little book, I think it's not a stretch to look at it for what it is. The more appropriate title should be: How To Train A Little Fascist. Aside from being obviously sentimental it was also a bit boring. I refuse to let my kid read it.
