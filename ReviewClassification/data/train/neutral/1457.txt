Oh geez.This book fell victim to "It was really great at first but then I had 7 chapters to read in one night so I started skimming it and cramming it was making it less enjoyable and now reading this book feels like a task even though if I was given more time I could enjoy it to its full extent but now after being bored for so many chapters I have no interest in picking it up again outside of class."Genuinely, I like the world. I love the characterization of Sam and Frodo. I like Gandalf, and the action, and the compelling danger of the Ring. But all of the elven info dumps and the politics of "so and so had the ring and so and so can't get the ring" got very tiresome. I listened to a huge chunk of this book on audiobook at 2X speed while cleaning my room, and I only absorbed about half of it, so i'm not entirely sure what's been going on, and that makes me sad. I feel like I need to read a summary of this or watch the movie just because I feel like I really only read half of this book. Hopefully the next two in the trilogy will focus on more action rather than lengthy dialogue scenes talking about ~~how powerful!!!~~ the ring is.
