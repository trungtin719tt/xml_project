After waiting 100 years for book 3, I expected a lot more. The meat of this book could have been condensed into about 100 pages. Very little plot development occurred. There was some character development, but not enough to warrant 750 pages.I probably wouldn't be so critical, but the video he posted stating why it took so long to get to book 3 said that he didn't feel he could do it in one book. Bad news. I bet that if you read book 1, book 2, and 3 selected chapters of book 3, you could go straight to book 4 without any problems.The books in this series seem to get more disappointing as they come out. I'll keep reading because I've invested about 60 dollars in the series so far.
