This novel is about Holly dealing with the death of her husband, Gerry. She later discovers that Gerry left a series of letters for every month for a year. One for Jan, Feb, March, etc. The story was heartwarming. Liked the little twist in the end although I wanted the ending to go a bit more slower. In the end, it seemed like she became a lot more(view spoiler)[ okay with Gerry's death than she was before, it felt like the author did that to finish the book faster :p(hide spoiler)]I really appreciated the writer not adding unnecessary details to make the book bigger than it was. Even if the writing style was simple, she had a flair for simple writing (does that make sense?) unlike those who write simply because they don't have any skill.......but this writer has the skill to keep things simple....like a pro? Don't know how to say this, I ain't no writer) But I was really glued to the book by the last 1/3 and I cried there.
