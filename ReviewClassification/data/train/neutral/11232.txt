I FINALLY finished this! I just don't have time to read long books in print any more, but I've wanted to read this for a while &amp; found it worthwhile. It's certainly not a perfect book. There's a lot of convenience, especially Marie's love &amp; expertise. Several times there were silenced revolvers, too. I hate them, but the plot was twisty &amp; the psychology was good - better done than the way amnesia &amp; all is typically done. Well, for me, anyway. My knowledge of psychology &amp; amnesia are practically nonexistent, at best. Still, it worked well in the story &amp; retained its logic.It was nice to finally see what the movie was based on. As usual, there isn't much in common beyond the names of the characters &amp; the non-stop action. It read pretty well &amp; was a nice change in pace from my normal reading. I don't think I'll run out &amp; read another of Ludlum's novels any time soon, if ever. I certainly won't read further in the series sinceEric Van Lustbadertook them over. I likedThe Sunset Warriortrilogy many years ago, but he's into writing bricks now. I read one of his ninja books a couple of decades ago &amp; I'm not into bricks of that sort.
