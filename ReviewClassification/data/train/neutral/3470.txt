The Maze Runneris a masterfully plotted mystery. It's intriguing. It draws you in quick and then reveals details at just the right time to keep you turning the pages for more.While many criticize the characters for being flat, which they are, Thomas and his fellow Maze Runners are at the very least likable. They play pranks, they crack jokes, they bond in inventive ways, and most importantly they're just fun in general. You can't help but like characters that are trapped in an almost literal Hell and somehow make the most of it to the point you secretly wish you were part of it. There's something magical in that.A story can only go so far with characters that don't really have any meaningful connection to the plot or the setting, though. Any of these guys could've been replaced for any other personality with barely any notice. I think James Dashner really squeezed the best possible plot he could out of the characters he created.The real pitfall ofThe Maze Runneris the writing. As Dashner might write,It's really, really bad. So bad, it leaves you feeling nothing in a lot of scenes you should feel loss or adrenaline or relief or... anything.
