This third installment of the House of Night series starts to feel a little preachy in its declaration of the heroine's personal values and opinions: I have, after all, listened to the exact same sentiments for three freaking books now. For much the same reason---that is, my experience of the previous two books---my tolerance for the heroine's idiotic decisions and lovelorn melodrama began to wear thin.Yes, I know you're a teenager, Zoey, and yes, I know the plot requires some stupidity on your part to move forward, but really? Do I have to keep reading as you willfully indulge in all manner of selfish vanity and lust? Have you no self control? Maybe not. And maybe that's okay, but it definitely doesn't make me care what happens to you.And yet somehow by the end of the book, once Zoey Got Hers, I found myself still caring enough about the other characters to want to read the next book. I'm just hoping that next book brings something a little new to the table.
