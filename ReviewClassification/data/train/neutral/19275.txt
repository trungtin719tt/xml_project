What I'm hopeful for is that Luce ends up with Cam. I just adore him! Daniel is so cut and dry in his manner. I might be missing the whole point of the series but it annoys me to no end that he won't choose a side. Cam is more shades of grey that I think compliment Luce better. I think there is something more there than Luce wants to admit. Plus I'm so sick of the whole obsessive love that transcends all reason (think Twilight). Plus it is insanely predictable that the "good" guy gets the girl. I'll be satisfied if Lauren finally answers all the questions I've had since book 1. *crosses fingers*
