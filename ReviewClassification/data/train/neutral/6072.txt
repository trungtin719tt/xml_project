I'm not feeling the love, but I definitely am feeling the creeps.I get the point - unconditional and everlasting love, hence the three stars. But that's just not how you do it man. I like what the book is saying, I just don't likehowit's saying it. Maybe, just maybe, I would've appreciated this story more as a kid, when I saw the world through innocent and unspotted eyes, but now I know such words like STALKER, PEEPING TOM, OBSESSIVE CREEP, LOONEY. Nooooooo. I just can't overlook how disturbing this is. I really couldn't enjoy this book. How do I fall asleep now? I just wanted something sweet **sniffs** This is definitely better than Edward Cullen's night watch sessions.Or maybe not. Maybe a lover watching his love sleep is better? But still, mothers creeping across floors and through windows at night, rocking and singing love songs toteenage boysandgrown men.In their sleep.Someone needs a lesson on privacy. There's nothing I hate more than an unwelcome and unpermitted invasion of privacy and simply put, STALKING. And the grown man takes this habit up and suddenly I can foresee it becoming something of a legacy. I love my father, I really do(and besides, even my father would agree with me completely. I don't know about anyone else, but I love when I'm awake and my father says "I love you" becauseAWAKE,like I can hear it, feel it and appreciate it and say it back). But this...justNO. Like bloody hell!You want to rock and sing to me? Wait till I amconscious.
