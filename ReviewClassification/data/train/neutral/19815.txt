I'd heard Hardy was a bit of a chore, so instead of his chunky novels I went slender withThe Mayor of Casterbridgeas my first. I'm not sure it was a wise choice.Not because I thought it was bad by any means. The writing's quite good, the story held my interest, but jeez louise, this is bleak stuff! It's bleaker thanBleak House! Are all this books like this? I'm not normally depressed, but I may have to put myself on suicide watch just to get through another one of his novels!Seriously though, I don't mind a dose of miserable realism now and then, and I liked that peek into an odd and terrible matrimonial tradition. Stories based on drunken missteps that linger into lifelong regrets do not generally lend themselves to frivolity and this book is not about happy happy good times. Back in merry ole England (and no doubt many other places) if a man no longer loved his woman, he could get rid of her and potentially make a profit. What a world...Some day I'll get around to meetingTess of the d'Ubervilles, but I fear by the end of the encounter I may want to get asFar from the Madding Crowdas possible!
