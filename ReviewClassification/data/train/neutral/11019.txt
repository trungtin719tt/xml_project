I wanted to really like this book in its entirety, but I got bogged down in the specific tactics of the battle of Gettysburg. I tried to study the maps and think about the positions of the various divisions....but ultimately realized that effort was detracting from what was really important to me: the motivations for the Civil War, the differences between the Southerners and Northerners, the perceptions each had of the other side, the role belief in God played, the human factor in the winning/losing of the battle, the role leadership (good or bad) played in the winning or losing of a battle, the sadness of fighting brothers or friends.The Killer Angels was a very insightful, inspiring way to learn about the Civil War. I feel very blessed that there were men of strong convictions who fought horrific battles, who suffered terrible injuries and losses, who ended up keeping this country together. In fact, between reading this book and Founding Brothers: the Revolutionary Generation, I feel I have a much better understanding of the fragility of our early country and of the heroism of our founders and the men who fought valiantly to create and preserve a new type of government.
