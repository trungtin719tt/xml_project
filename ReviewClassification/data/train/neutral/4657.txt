I don't know how I managed to go without reading this book as a child, but I finally got around to it. I do wish I'd have read it then though, because it doesn't work well for adults. It's about a young girl who finds herself stranded on an island completely alone. She befriends various island creatures and learns how to make a way for herself in survival. It's written for children, so it can be a bit boring reading it as an adult. But it was still interesting, especially since it's based on a true event where a woman was found on an island alone.
