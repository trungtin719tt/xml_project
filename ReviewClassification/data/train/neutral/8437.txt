A good story ruined for me by the way it's told - too many irrelevant sideshows, a constant flooding of insignificant details, too much flowery prose. The two important themes of this book - the racial prejudice harboured towards the Japanese-Americans during and after WW2 and the damage war does to a man's soul - often get lost in the surfeit of irrelevant detail, the backstories of incidental characters and the endless long passages about weather and landscape. A Japanese American is on trial for murdering a fellow fisherman who he seemingly has a motive to kill. The trial itself is an example of how overly detailed this novel is, the author painstakingly including all the nuances of courtroom protocol and thus dragging it out throughout the novel. We're consistently told things we don't need to know or already know and I eventually found myself skipping entire sections, something I rarely do. Disappointing.
