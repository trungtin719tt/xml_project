It wasn't a bad book, it really wasn't. Had i read this two or three years ago when I was neck deep in the my love for predictable happily ever afters, I would have been head over heels for this book. But sadly that isn't case now.The book was well written and with a melodic drift that made you want to find out what happens next, even though you kinda already knew what's going to happen since the first page. In a simply mediocre kind of way.But all in all I can't really complain, it's not something I would read again, but I did enjoy it enough to want to read the rest of the series. But then again that is debatable, given my limited time to read, and the frankly averageness of this book. The main character albeit, as previously mentioned, being predictable was quite interesting. She has a kindred spark to her spirit that always attracts me like a moth to a flame. And although I'm not particularly a fan of love triangles, this one started of from the beginning as a trio conflict. That I admit was also a source of attraction to me.The ending kind of put me out, because let's face it, boys and their egos don't allow for honest admission of mistakes and then the pledge to continue fighting for a girl that admits she might have feelings for someone else, no boy is that mature. (No offense to the male gender itself, but reality isn't so perfect).And just to be clear, I do not, in any way approve of violence. Not at all, but I honestly wouldn't mind Celeste's head on a pike too much, you know?
