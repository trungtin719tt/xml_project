The Shadowhunters meeting Gossip Girl.I must say, that I liked the main plot, the whole idea of vampires living in some kind of community and being reborn. But I didn't like the writing AT ALL. I felt like I was reading some crappy fanfiction. With all those pointless descriptions of looks, clothing, etc, and all these love stories. Also, the main character (well, actually, there are probably a few main characters) who is the embodiment of all the cliches - her parents are dead, she wears different clothes, has only one true friend and is totally not popular, then some popular guy has some interest in her but it turns out she's different than the rest of her community.But it's a quick read and I would recommend that to people who want to read something that's not demanding concentration.
