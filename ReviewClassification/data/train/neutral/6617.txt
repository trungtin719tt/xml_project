I really liked the narrator of this book a lot. I thought he did a fantastic job! That said, I was disappointed with the ending. Up to the ending the story was good - a little sappy but I like that every now and then. I particularly liked the story with John and his Dad.**Spoilers**Once Savannah broke up with John and married Tim I knew it wasn't going to end in a good way. Tim was sick and either he dies so that John can get the girl or John bows out and gets nothing. Either way it would be crappy. It ended up that John bows out plus sells his coins for Tim's recovery and ends up with no girl and no money. I guess that part makes me sad, especially given that Savannah doesn't love Time like she did John. Which makes me angry at Savannah for marring someone when she loved someone else more.
