Second revived review to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the death of Jane Austen. Sorry Jane, this is rather a feeble review.*****The only thing I can remember about this beloved novel is that I read it on the bus to work. That's it. On the bus. Sorry.The three stars is because I like reading on buses.
