The first book in the Sookie Stackhouse series.I confess - I picked this up at the bookstore for a few reasons:1. The cover was sparkly and I liked the art.2. Vampires! Having spent a huge chunk of my youth hoping the vampires in Anne Rice's novels would knock on my window late at night (shut-up, like you didn't???) I have been looking for the next Brad Pitt with fangs. (shut-up, like you aren't???)And yeah. That was all it took. Sparkles and vampires - SOLD.I opened up the book and kinda regreted it and thought -Well that's what you get!The main character is called (WHAT???) Sookie Stackhouse? And she is blond and a bar waitress and likes to flaunt her tight clothes and tans out in her lawn in a bikini. Hu.But Ineveralmost never stop reading a book once I start so I bravely forged ahead. And suddenly I stopped laughing and the pages started turning and I found myself thinking about the book when I wasn't reading it and wondering how fast I could get the next book....So glad that there were sparkles on the cover of this book. So very very glad.
