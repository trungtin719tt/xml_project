I was intrigued by this book for three things: the pretty cover, the nice title, and the fact that the back cover features a plug fromTamora Pierce. Then I read the summary and learned that it was about fairies, and how they aren't just fun and games - they can be scary, too. Why not? I decided to read it.It's about this chick named Aislinn (kooky name, huh?) who can see fairies (actually, the book spells it "faery" - I guess Marr couldn't decide between fairy and faerie and so went middle of the road). So, she knows when Keenan, who is, as it turns out, no common faery but instead the king of the Summer Court of faeries, starts tailing her. As it turns out, Keenan's looking for a mortal girl who will turn out to be the lost Summer Queen with whose help he will be able to put the tyrannical Winter Queen back in her place. As I'm sure you can imagine, romance ensues, blah blah blah.This book is pretty good fluff. It's enjoyable to read and it held my attention, but I doubt that it will be mental super-glue. Marr's style is just as pleasantly bland, as are her characters. The book reminded me rather ofTithe: A Modern Faerie Tale, only better. It's worth a read, but probably not likely to become a treasured favorite.
