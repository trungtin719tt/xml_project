David Guterson's award-winning debut is set in 1954 on the fictional island of San Pietro, off the coast of Washington state. When the body of fisherman Carl Heine is discovered early one foggy morning, the police are in no doubt that they have a murder on their hands. Suspicion falls upon Kabuo Miyamoto, a fellow fisherman who was known to been in dispute with the Heine family. Home to a large Japanese community, tensions have been high on San Pietro ever since Pearl Harbor, and the ensuing trial only serves to add fuel to the flames. With evidence piling up, thing are looking grim for Kabuo - his wife Hatsue and their children are starting to lose hope. But local newspaperman Ismael Chambers has a nagging feeling that the case is not as clear-cut as it seems, and he begins his own inquiries into Carl's death.A review in the Independent on Sunday praised this novel for having a "page-whizzing narrative" and I can't think of a more inaccurate description. The pace is languorous for the most part, as Guterson gives us an intricate backstory of every major and minor character. Some of these detours I found absorbing, such as Ismael's horrific experiences in World War II. But other chapters, like a plodding reminiscence of his teenage romance with Hatsue almost put me to sleep. Yet I kept reading. The characters are so detailed and believably rendered, I had to find out their fates. So if you're looking for a nail-biting courtroom drama, I'd advise steering clear. However, if thoughtfully-constructed murder mysteries are your thing, then you can't go far wrong with this one.
