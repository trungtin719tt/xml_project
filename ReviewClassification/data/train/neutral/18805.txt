I'm back on the Outlander train...again. Mostly because I just want to finish this series!I definitely dived intoAn Echo in the Bonewithout expectations. WHY? Well, because I already knew it was probably going to be like 100x longer than it needed to be. It might be poring in a ton of parts. I might not like it?What do you get from this book? Well lots of POV's to start! We get Claire, Jamie, Brianna, Roger, Ian, John, William, and so much more! This made me so happy because I was kind of getting sick of reading from Claire's POV. Not that I hate the girl or anything.. but it was getting annoying and boring. Unfortunately, I was kind of getting annoyed with Brianna's POV because it was like reading from Claire's...There is adventure in here too. Plus Claire and Jamie also find trouble.. or does trouble always find them?!? Either way the book makes you think they wont get from point A to point B but in the end they do. They always do.The one POV I loved was probably from William. I don't really know how to explain it but it was refreshing to read from. I was definitely shipping him with Rachel!! Ugh, they were adorable!Overall, I liked the book but I still found it boring and super long. Maybe if it was cut in half I would've enjoyed it more?
