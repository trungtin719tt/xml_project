I can only see this book as a score of missed opportunities.I loved the first few chapters - the quick dive into an absurd dystopian world where delivering pizzas becomes a matter of life and death is particularly brilliant. The book is let down by its poor plot - on a par with a bad James Bond movie - two questionable scenes (in my mind), and a particularly unbelievable resolution of the 'snow crash' mystery. Basically, it all came apart in the second part of the book which also sports a rushed and unsatisfying end.The three stars I gave the book is for the moments of brilliance that transform the book in parts.There are descriptions and passages that are worth reading this book for.*This section contains spoilers*I did enjoy the 'badass' and 'hardboiled' shenanigans and dialogues very much, but there are two moments in the book that I could have done without.The first one centers on the scene where our 15 year old heroine, Y.T. is seduced by arch - villain Raven. During (consensual) intercourse she manages to anaesthesize the guy with a device contained in her vagina. This is given a light treament and we are supposed to find it hilarious. Well, I read something not long ago that I thought was great advice for writers. How do you know your story is sexist (or not)? The advice given was to replace your heroin by a hero and see if you feel the same way about the scene. Now imagine a 15 year old boy in that same scene. I 'll let you make your own mind up on this one.The other scene touches upon the name of one of the refugee that helps Hiro to get onto the villain's boat lair - that poor block's name is Transubstanciacion and we are told that everyone's calling him 'Tranny'. Very funny.Now, let's do the same as we did before. Let's imagine a woman instead, her name is Controversial but her nickname is 'Cunty'. Now, you know were I am going with this.Shame because actually Hiro is a great example of a non white protagonist.
