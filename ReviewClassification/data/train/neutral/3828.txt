3.5 stars or 4. I don't know. Hmpf.I was really looking forward to reading this book. Rose is one of my favorite characters and so I spent the last few months worrying about what was going to happen.Highly anticipated books are always difficult. I can't imagine what it must be like to write a book thathasto be exactly right, because let's face it, nobody wants to be the next Smeyer. But I do know what it is like to read one and I think Richelle Mead pulled it off, more or less. Pretty much. *frowns*The entire book is one long action sequence, and the bond between Lissa and Rose did a good job of letting us keep in touch with all the main characters I like. I didn't get bored while reading this, at all. But the entire thing felt a bit like Rose was yelling "Here I come to save the daaaaaaay!" on every page.I think it was very obvious what was going to happen between Rose and Dimitri in this book. And I don't say I didn't want them to be together because I'm happy they are. But the way Adrian gets treated... I'm sorry but, that'sexactlythe reason why I'm giving this book 3.5 or 4 stars instead of 5. I know, I know, my spot for him isverysoft, so I kinda want to morph into a tigress and bite the head off every person who tries to hurt him,but still, hear me out.I'm not exactly annoyed by the fact that Rose and Adrian broke up, because we all knew what was coming, and Adrian did too if he was honest with himself. But when I realized nothing was going to happen between Rose and Adrian after their last 'conversation' I nearly crushed my Kindle. It felt like he was being kicked off the plane and everybody just stood there and waved goodbye. That wasnotthe wayIwanted to say goodbye to Adrian. *jumps after him and yells "Adriaaaaaaaaaaaaaan"*GAH. I just... *storms off while being airborne*
