My Rating- 3.5I was introduced to Rumi in my childhood through the collection of poetry by my uncle since then I heard so many stories about Mawlana Rumi and Shams Tabrej. One thing I can say, that this book is unable to justify the image that I have of Mawlana Rum in my mind.It was very grasping till the part two and I really enjoyed the flow and the unfolding of events, however, for later parts, I believe, it could have been shown better with more grasping and vivid personality of Rumi.
