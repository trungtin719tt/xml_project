The story is well written, the details are good, the two main characters and their life journeys are impressive enough to keep me reading. However, the secondary characters aren't all that great. And this story also doesn't give us any motto outside of "with enough wits and constant hard work, you can get rich in America!" and I'm like...'what?'Still...I will read more of this author's works when I have time.
