Poetic prose or prosaic poetry?Either way a beautiful work. It has the social commentary of a husbandry lesson and the spiritual depth of a prayer.It's also apparently timeless. Thoreau's ideas about simplicity and spiritual cleanliness are as relevant today as they were in the 1840s.I cannot help but mention a college English professor's description of him: "he lived in a shack out on the outskirts of town - he was a bum". Still makes laugh.
