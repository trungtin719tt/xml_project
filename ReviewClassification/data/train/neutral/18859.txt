Soooo... This is a reread. When I first read it I rated it four stars. But I hadn't really read too many YA books when I read this and since I've read SOOOOO many, much better YA books. So I'm downgrading my rating to 3 stars. While I liked how it doesn't make any of the final decisions easy or trite, I just don't think the teenage girl was written like a teenage girl. Her thought processes are at the grade school level, as if she's ten years younger than she actually is. : /
