Update - NEWS ABOUT the HBO mini-series of "Sharp Objects". Who else has seen it?What are your thoughts? Which did you enjoy more? The book or the series?Amy Adams was outstanding!!! One of the best acting roles I've seen her play.VERY creepy show -- 'excellent' -- All the actors were great. In many ways --I liked the HBO show more than the book. I know --weird --right? --Or??? maybe I was more prepared for just how disturbing this story is! The ending in the HBO series -- was ......................'creepy' as can be!!!OLD REVIEW:I've had both "Sharp Objects" and "Dark Places" for years....but, hey, I'm slow.I picked "Sharp Objects" to read first when I heard Amy Adams is going to be the leading actress in a drama series.I wasn't expecting so much violence. This is a very dark disturbing story...........but my favorite parts were the psychological aspects of he mother/daughter relationship. When a child has a mother from hell - kinda shapes your lifefrom the 'get-go' and not in a pretty way.I can already see Amy Adams playing the role of reporter Camille Preaker....who returns to her small hometown to cover the murders of two preteen girls.She identifies with the girls a little too closely -- plus she had recently spent a short stay in a psychiatric hospital.Camille is vulnerable- fragile- and flawed. The closer she gets to cracking the case she is working on, the more she begins to crack. Old haunting demons are rising to the surface ...memories of her sister and emotional and physical abuse.This book could have been called "DARK SHARP PLACES AND OBJECTS"!!!Happy day 2 days after Halloween ....ha! :)3. to almost a 3.5
