Sookie has never been the brightest bulb in the pack, but she hits an all-time low in the intelligence department in this book. Her most grievous offence, in my eyes, is that she continues to pine for boring, bland Bill throughout this book. Bill is not only boring, but he's a cheating asshole.Why Bill is an asshole list:1. He is boring2. He has no sense of humor3. He is filthy rich and yet lets his "love" scrape and scratch to live in poverty4. Even if he wasn't rich, he never brings her flowers or does anything thoughtful for her5. He is heavy-handed and calls her "mine" as in ownership (refer to 3 &amp; 4: is that how you treat "yours"?)6. He lies to her about where he is going7. He is cheating on her8. He viciously bites her9. He rapes her10. Even after attacking and raping her, he has the nerve to think they should still be togetherSo, I hate Bill.So, Bill the Cheating, Raping, Asshole gets kidnapped while he is out cheating on Sookie. What does Sookie do?A) Say "Good riddance to bad rubbish" and move on with her life while laughing manicallyB) Let Erik and the vampires handle it because it's not her problem anymoreC) Turn her own life upside down to run out to save him while crying like a little bitch about how much she misses himPersonally, I would pick A. But, Sookie isn't me, or even a normal human being, because she picks C and runs off on a rescue mission for a guy who was literally planning on not even telling her that he was dumping her for another woman. This pissed me off to no end!But, at least we get Alcide, the werewolf. Alcide is a stand-up guy, and guess what? He can be out during the daytime! A big plus in a relationship. He and Sookie are partnered up to infiltrate a vampire club to see if they can get any info on Bill the Dickhead. And, of course, they do - and Sookie gets hurt - again...And, there's Eric, who is completely awesome and wants Sookie as well. (For an uneducated, poor, white trash barmaid, this girl is somehow irresistible to every male south of the Mason Dixon Line.)Why won't Sookie choose Eric? He actually possesses a personality and sense of humor.Plus, look:is there really a choice here?I just don't get it.
