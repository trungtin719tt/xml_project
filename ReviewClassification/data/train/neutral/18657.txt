Third book in the series and I still haven't rated any book more than 3 stars.Mercy Thompson has done it all, Rescue the werewolves, vampires and now faes. Yes friends, there's nothing she isn't capable of.One of the issues I had with this book was the fact that she doesn't really shift into a Coyote often but she did frequently in this book and I found it so boring.I really enjoy this series but there's nothing special about it.
