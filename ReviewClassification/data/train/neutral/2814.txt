3.5 stars - Wow, what an end! Overall, a pretty good book, but boy was it infuriating!First of all, I LOVED LOVED LOVED Divergent. But I didn't like Tris or Four very much in this book. I don't remember Tris being such a bitch, and I understand that she is Dauntless now, and she has been through a lot, but she is just so mean. And Four has more mood swings than a girl - especially for someone who was so stoic, not in actual feelings but in display of feelings, in the first book. The two made me want to shake them - and not in the "you frustrate me so much you make me hot" kind of way. No, they made me angry in the "why do you keep TRYING to pick a fight with each other" and "why do you two insist on acting so stupid!"As for the storyline itself. It started a bit slow, and it was a bit confusing as they moved from faction to faction - not because I didn't understand what was going on, but because I couldn't see how things were going to play out in the whole scheme of things. The real action doesn't really happen until much later, and I thought the end was kind of mind-blowing because it was NOT what I was expecting at all.Setting my frustrations with Tris aside, I did like how the book showed the different sides of her - proving she is a true Divergent, but I still don't understand a few things like what the Divergents' role in how are they supposed to help/hurt the "mission?" I guess this is going to be left for Book 3.Overall, it was a good book, but not nearly as good as the first book because I felt a lot was going on, and I was am left with so many questions at the end. I know it's trying to lead readers into Book 3, but I was hoping more would have been filled along the way.
