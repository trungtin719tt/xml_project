Hmmm...I am still unsure about this series. The vampire world of the House of Night series, the magic, mythology, and biology, is intriguing, but the characters are not overly believable and often do things that make me cringe. The love triangle (square?) that develops is a bit gross...okay, it is a *lot* gross...and I'm hoping that the focus shifts back to the vampire world for book four.
