3 "think I get it...but needed more" stars.I very much liked this adult fable but not to the extent that many of my real life and Goodreads friends did.At times I was completely absorbed and mesmerized by the narrative and other times I felt that the cosmology was inconsistent, random and a tad repetitive. I intuit that I understood the esthetic that Gaiman was attempting but often to me it was a miss rather than a hit. The writing was beautiful, rich and full of complex emotion but it often felt that it was pulled out of thin air without careful planning and the pseudo-mysticism was a bust for me (and that's saying a lot because I tend to eat that stuff up with whipped cream)Often Gaiman understood the seven year old protagonist to the core but then he would veer off and the child had the mind and comprehension of adulthood. This was jarring to say the least.I look forward to reading more Gaiman (American Gods is on my shortlist) but I am not sure why he has achieved rock star bookselling status. All in all though this was a more than adequate read for an autumn weekend away at the cottage. Somehow though I wanted and expected more. Perhaps in future books I will get it.
