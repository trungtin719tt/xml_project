This book brought forth some memories of the time when I last visited my little hometown and there is one such incident that happened then which sums up this book nicelyI had started my first day of the summer vacations with one of tastiest orange juice I had ever had.The secret was obviously in the oranges. My mother told me about this woman who although from an extremely meagre background, had dared to break free from the chain of middlemen to produce her own oranges by maintaining a small grove in the nearby village. A few days later, I visited the fruit mandi (mandi= local mini-market)and managed to casually ask this woman's young daughter about the secret of her mother's delicious oranges. With a carefree smile of utmost joy, she eagerly told me about her mother's fondness for growing fruits, her love for the process, from leveling to sowing to proper irrigation, the way she sings to them, her need to keep a close tab of each one of their health and moods,as if they were her own little children.Now, I believe that something of that care and love is transmitted into the orange. The result is an explosion of flavor, a shiver of rich pleasure down the spine as soon as that fiery orange hits your tongue.This woman, as if espousing the message of Walden, is not working on a cure for cancer nor is she busy developing the next breakthrough technology that will change the world. Forget that, hardly a few souls in this world know about her. But, she does what she does. However humble her vocation may be, she honors those moments with a mindful effort of utmost passion and unfettered love, all the while making our world a better place,one orange at a time.
