After nearly 5 years of owning this book, I've finally read it (thanks to Rincey hosting the readalong this month that gave me the motivation). I can't say I loved the book, but it was fun and had its moments. It's sort of a bunch of vignettes, especially at the beginning, to acquaint you with the characters. And then the real plot sort of develops later on in the novel. It has all those follies and foibles of classics, with misdirection, confusion, deus ex machinas galore, and is, at times, a tad ridiculous. But I can see the appeal and would definitely love to watch an adaptation of this story! Cheers to tackling behemoth books that sit on your shelf for ages.
