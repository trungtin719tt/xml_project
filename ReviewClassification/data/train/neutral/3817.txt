I don't know what happened between the first time I read this book and this time but the first time I rated it 5 stars and now I can't get over the fact that Rose played Adrian and acted like a immature selfish girl. It really bugged me this time that one minute she would go on about loving Adrian and the next she would be like Dimitri is the love of my life. One minute she was kissing Adrian and the next she was having sex with Dimitri. It pissed me off. The plot was good but the Adrian, Dimitri thing bugged me so much that I had a hard time really enjoying it.
