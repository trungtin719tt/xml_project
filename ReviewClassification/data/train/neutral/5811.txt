I wondered for a while why this book felt more like a fieldwork than a guided mind tour, but the answer is obvious. It lays in the fact that the novel has little of that character building I'm used from reading mainly Western literature. The surroundings are not put in the background to serve only as a reflection of one's thought process, but form an organism of its own. Here, in the middle of an African village on the verge of white people's arrival, the rhythm of living is dictated by weather, crops and all sacred nature's inventions. Inner life is as important as any of intangible magical forces - not very much in comparison with the plenitude of all the other ephemeral things.Everything that transcends an individual is a cause for commotion. Marriage means a colossal feast and faraway death disturbs everyone's night rest. All the society's great events are accompanied by divine beings. With such a vast entourage, many of this distant world's characteristic that we condemn today (gender inequality, lack of education, ostracism...) feel at least as peaceful and joyous as the ones we've gotten used to cherish. Even some aspects of their arbitrary laws and consequent violence made me feel sorry for all that was lost in between.Without written, defined constitution, justice is made by people's spontaneous and versatile interpretations of it. Divine order (or nature as a whole) is an unfair judge; it speaks to everyone differently and its language is too similar to all kinds of prejudices and accumulated experiences. But it is also a very reassuring messenger. It makes everyone responsible only to itself, the whole. Wrongdoings are therefore punished only for restoration of the divine order; they have no integral fault or debt to society in themselves. Guilt is nonexistent and thinking about alternatives diminished. Nowadays, there's only camping left for a little bit of nature's touch.
