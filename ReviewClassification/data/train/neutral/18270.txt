I bought this book at some point, I don't remember buying it.It kept falling off of the pile of mass-market books I have precariously piled up in front of some other books on one of my bookshelves.After maybe the hundredth time picking this book up and putting it back on the top of that pile I thought, maybe I should just read it instead of just picking it up ever couple of weeks.The particular edition I read was the third Dell printing, from May 1965. I don't know if the book had the same cover on earlier Dell editions. Goodreads says this edition is from 1971 I think. By 1971 this particular type of cover had gone a bit out of style.It looks lurid. A bound woman has her arms around a man on top of her. There is a feeling of lust about to be satiated.ExplosiveChilling, shockingEvilYou'll beshockedIt will be difficult to find this book shocking today. The most shocking thing was maybe how many little details Thomas Harris might have taken from the book to make upSilence of the Lambs. In the years since this book has come out it's hard to find the story of a stand-offish type who kidnaps a girl and keeps her in his cellar, showers her with gifts and gives her everything she wants except for her freedom as all that evil. Somewhat evil. Like an Eichmann in the pantheon of guys who do fucked up things to other people. A banal version of a Ted Bundy or a Jeffrey Dahmer. You can't blame the book though that we've become a whole lot more fucked up as a society since the words in this book were penned. Even when the blurbs that decorate this book were written Charlie Manson hadn't yet heard Paul McCarthy screech about riding on a slide.Ted, Just Admit it.I can't adequately put myself in the position of a reader in the early 1960s to see this as particularly sinister or shocking.As an expose of evil, or a thriller or whatever you would want to call this type of book I think it fails. The villain, a mild-mannered loser of sorts who doesn't fit in anywhere wins the lottery. With his new found wealth he buys a house in Thomas Hardy's neck of the woods and fortifies the house as a prison for the object of his affections; a young art student who he has developed a fascination with. So he kidnaps her and keeps her prisoner. He wants nothing from her except that she be his. No sex or even really her love, just her presence. In his basement. In the room hidden behind some fake shelving.The first half of the book is his story. The second half the diary she keeps while his prisoner.The big problem I have with the book is that he never comes alive, and I think this is sort of the point of the book. He's a dead character, he's thePetite bourgeoisie, the lifeless masses of restrained 'good taste'. The collectors of things who never really live. His whole character is a thing rather than a person. It made what he does seem fucked up, but not evil. He's so devoid of any kind of passion or deviancy that he's more just a pathetic loser that comes across as having possibly eaten a few too many chips of lead paint as a child.I felt the main section of this book is Miranda's diary. The device of getting to see the situation from her point of view could have been used quite well to counteract the way that the first person narration of her capture and imprisonment had been shown. If this had been done, it would have been a different book entirely, and it's not really fair to whine that a book doesn't do what you want, so I'm hoping it doesn't sound like I'm doing that. It could have been an interesting way to juxtapose the narrative, that's all I'm saying.Instead her diary turns into mostly an account of her friendship with an older artist who she was both fascinated and repelled by for his unconventional views on art and life. These two figures in her life, her mentor of sorts and her jailer are pitted against one another in the way the world works. Two extremes, the one the unconventional artistic view and the other the so overly restrained 'normal' world that has kept itself wrapped up so tight in it's own neuroses that it results in her captor.Instead of what the 1960's marketing team of Dell made up the book to be, it's really just another novel about a young person wanting to break free from the confines of polite society. Just in this case it's a more literal escape she is looking for. Seen in this light, the novel is ok, but it didn't really do that much for me either. It seems too much like a less pedantic version of a DH Lawrence novel, complete with the priggish hero of individuality--but with a kidnapping.I might have enjoyed this book more at a different time in my life. Currently, I'm a little impatient with the young artist who sees the world as it really genre, never mind the glorification of the asshole artist as exemplar of how to live (not that I think Fowles is doing that here, kind of doing it, but not really doing it, it's more like he's doing it in the contrasting between the two extremes he has created in the two main male characters of the book). I think for the contemporary reader this fails as a shocking novel, and for a novel about 'authentic' living it would be better to just go read some Lawrence or Hesse if this is your kind of thing.
