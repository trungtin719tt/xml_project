This have been on my TBR for a while and I was really excited that it was available at my library. I have been trying to my TBR down from 2500 (I think I'm down about like a hundred.. maybe? Who knows.) Either way I was really excited to read this book. Plus, a new author? Heck yes, sign me up!Life As We Knew Itwas surprisingly good. It did have some boring parts but I somehow overlooked those (wine helps a lot with these sort of problems! or food). The characters can sometimes be likable but they do make stupid decisions throughout the book. It was kind of annoying to just read what they were saying or believing. Long story short, I definitely rolled my eyes a whole bunch of times.Then there's the storyline which I was kind of iffy about. I like survival stories or when people are thrown into different situations (like the 100 or something) but this book just had me flip-flopping all over the place. I would probably be bald if I went from flip-flopping to pulling out my hair in frustration.Overall, I liked the book. I would've loved it but there's nothing I can really change about it since this book has been out for like ever. I don't really know what else to say. I guess I just expected more but I can accept what I read at the same time? I will definitely have to think about whether or not I want to continue this series because I don't want to be disappointed by the next book or be mad because someone else read the second book and said it was a lot better than the first.Tough decision guys - make it for me!
