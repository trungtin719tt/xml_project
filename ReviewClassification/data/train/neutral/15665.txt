Of all 4 Discworld novels I've read, this one is my favourite. It's a cute story and Death is definitely a funny and interesting guy. It didn't fully keep my interest though, as the story lags a bit in the middle. The writing style is clever, but the characters feel stilted at times. I've decided to stop reading the Discworld series. I just don't feel the enthusiasm I was hoping I would.
