Rachel falls for her best friend's fiance during her 30th birthday party. The fiance, Dex, returns Rachel's amorous feelings. Rachel and Dex went to law school together and Rachel introduced Dex to her best friend. Meanwhile, Darcy, the best friend, remains clueless and engrossed in wedding planning. Emily Giffin, the author, paints Darcy as the villian (she's self-centered and shallow), especially when *spoiler* Darcy comes over to Rachel's apartment to tell her the wedding is off (the week before it's supposed to happen). Darcy reveals that she has also been having an affair with one of the groomsmen and is now pregnant. But I still can't completely get behind Rachel and Dex's relationship. I understand that they did not want to hurt Darcy's feelings, but hooking up behind your best friend/fiancee's back is not the way to go about things--call off the wedding already!! Darcy would probably have still been upset that her best friend stole her man, but it probably would have been less underhanded and painful for all involved.
