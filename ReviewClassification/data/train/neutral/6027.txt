Sadly I don't remember much about this one, except for the fact that the setting is very important and that it is an intense mystery. I read it for school three years ago. Crazy I don't even remember fragments of the story because I recall we did a long and mentally painful paper on it.Murder... wife... not really a dog... Baah, what am I even saying. It's a blank.
