ToMR. SOURPUSSMost Revered Lower SecretaryMinistry of TemptationDear Sir,At the outset, let me express my deep regret at a set of my letters (to my wayward nephew Wormwood) having fallen into the hands of a loyal servant of the Enemy and getting published. I will take the liberty of saying most emphatically that this is not due to any lack of foresight from my part: Your August Person used to know Wormwood, and what a nincompoop he was. I must state with no little pleasure that our current set of tempters are built of much tougher material, and consequently we have been on the winning side in our struggle with the Enemy for the past few decades. One only has to cast one's eye over the world once.However, the affair of "The Screwtape Letters" (as they have come to be known) are a matter of no little anguish to my own person, and I make no hesitation in stating that I am willing to accept whatever punishment Our Father may seem fit to disburse. But it is gratifying to note that the human race, in its infinite stupidity, have not taken them seriously: indeed, it is described as a "humorous novella"! One just has to visit the Goodreads website where even people committed to the Enemy are heaping wholesome praise on it! So, in my humble opinion, we need not worry our heads on that account.One more thing. Let me take this occasion to congratulate Your August Person and similar dignitaries of the Lowerarchy on the new method of subversion which is working so brilliantly on humanity: that of subverting the love of the Enemy into hatred of all others who did not subscribe to that particular version of the Enemy! Humanity is indeed too dumb to understand that Loveisthe Enemy (even though they display posters to that effect all over, as a platitude) and that Hatred is Our Father. Why the Enemy loves these idiots and wants them to attain everlasting happiness, one can only wonder!Your Obedient ServantSCREWTAPE.
