I have mixed feelings about Iron Kissed.It started absolutely great - Mercy gets in the middle of fae trouble, story finally moves forward with new plot twists. But... Romance.I love suspense/mystery side of this series much more than romance. It "pops up" in the weirdest situations and I was just: "Get over yourself already, woman!" I didn't really feel chemistry between Mercy and Adam because there is no actual interaction - just endless Mercy's soliloquies about why she likes Adam and why she likes Sam and why she can't choose (but she did choose, it's obvious from her rants, plus constant repeating of what happened before with both men. So yes, romance ruined Iron Kissed for me.On the other hand, mystery was brilliant. I was on my toes whole time and I really didn't guess who was the bad guy. I never thought that it would be(view spoiler)[Tim(hide spoiler)]- I actually had few other suspects, but never(view spoiler)[him(hide spoiler)].Ending was... wow. Powerful. Also, it made me like pack dynamics more. Speaking about how the story ended, I noticed one thing - it is so obvious that Iron Kissed is a little bit older book - it's quite tame (actually, term conservative would be better in this case) when it comes to explicit scenes. I guess authors braved with more graphic descriptions later.I should rate this book, right? Romance is 2 stars, mystery 4 stars, writing changed depending of subject, so it would be... 3 stars.
