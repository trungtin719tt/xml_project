I read this because one of my school friends said it was his favorite.. ever so I had to give it a go! Wasn't bad but didn't blow my mind or anything. I was completely content in putting and down to do other things, wasn't gripped at all... wait on second thought Brian ends up dropping the Hatchet in the water. That sense was intense and gripping besides that I found myself just along for the ride.What I'd read this book for: if you're looking for a short and easy read. a vaca, no hard thinking or new world's, etc.In all, it's good book and I can see how it became a classic for middle grade students.
