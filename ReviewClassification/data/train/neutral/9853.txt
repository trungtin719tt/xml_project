I wish I could've seen what performances of this play were like in Shakespeare's time. Since women couldn't be on stage, men had to play the women's roles, which means that the guy playing Viola had to also dress up as a man while acting like a woman.You have to wonder if the audience ever really knew what was going on. I'll bet you anything you like that some form of the following conversation took place in the Globe Theater at one point:GROUNDLING 1: Wait, wasn't that guy playing a girl? Why's he a guy again?GROUNDLING 2: No, Viola's dressing up as a man.GROUNDLING 1: So...he's a guy, playing a girl, playing a guy?GROUNDLING 2: Yes. I think.GROUNDLING 1: ...want me to get another round of ale?GROUNDLING 2: God yes.Oh, and alsoTWELFTH NIGHT, ABRIDGED:VIOLA: Okay, where the fuck are we?CAPTAIN: We're in Illyria - there's a duke who lives here who's totally in love with this chick Olivia, but she's all sad because her brother died like a year ago but Orsino won't leave it alone.ORSINO: *sits in his room listening to "Love Hurts" on repeat and writing Olivia/Orsino fanfiction*VIOLA: Well then, I guess the only thing for me to do is disguise myself as a boy and go work for Orsino! Ha ha, wouldn't it be a funny and awkward twist if I fell in love with Orsino?CAPTAIN: Yeah...that'd be real unexpected.OLIVIA: CESARIO, TELL YOUR STUPID MASTER THAT FOR THE HUNDREDTH TIME, I DON'T WANT TO GET MARRIED RIGHT NOW BECAUSES I AM KIND OF IN MOURNING FOR THE ONLY FAMILY MEMBER I HAD. IT'S NOT A GOOD TIME.CESARIO/VIOLA: Look, I know you're sad and everything - hey, my twin brother just died in a shipwreck too - but Orsino like, really really loves you. 'Cause you're hot, and stuff.OLIVIA: Oh stop,you'rehot. Kiss me!CESARIO/VIOLA: Oh, HELL no.SHAKESPEARE: Hee hee! Lesbians.ORSINO: Why won't Olivia love me? My life is so unfair. Are you in love with anyone, Cesario? Because it sucks.CESARIO/VIOLA: Yes, I love somebody. Somebody your complexion, and your height...but she's totally a chick, because I am obviously a boy.ORSINO: Love sucks, and women are unfaithful whores.CESARIO/VIOLA: Um...wow, you're actually sort of a douche. Why exactly am I attracted to you?ORSINO: I assumed it was the brooding. Chicks dig guys who brood.TOBY BELCH: Hey everybody, it's Comic Relief Time! Malvolio, Olivia has a crush on you and wants you to wear these poncy yellow stockings and smile all the time.MALVOLIO: Well, they do make my legs look fabulous.EVERYONE: HE'S CRAZY! LOCK HIM IN THE CRAZYHOUSE! IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH CARE WON'T EXIST FOR ANOTHER 400 YEARS!SEBASTIAN: Thank god I survived that horrible shipwreck! Too bad my sister's dead, though.OLIVIA: Cesario! I demand that we have sex immediately!SEBASTIAN: YES MA'AM!ORSINO: Cesario, what the hell are you doing?SEBASTIAN: Who?CESARIO/VIOLA: OMG SEBASTIAN!SEBASTIAN: OMG VIOLA!EVERYONE: WTF?VIOLA: I'm a girl, surprise!ORSINO: I love liars! Let's get married!MALVOLIO: HEY! You assholes got me locked in a cell and then sent some clown to mock me! I swear by all that is holy, I WILL BE REVENGED ON YOU ALL!VIOLA: Wait...is that seriously how the play ends? A guy we had wrongly incarcerated promises to get his revenge, which he actually kind of deserves?FASTE: How about this? - I'll play a song, and then maybe the audience will forget that this play actually has the creepiest ending ever?*he does, and we do.THE END.
