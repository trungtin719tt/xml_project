This is one of those books where I find myself agreeing with the five star reviews and the one star reviews with almost equal enthusiasm.On one hand, it's the sweet story of a man as he reconnects with a former mentor/professor, who is facing a death sentence via ALS. It's obvious that Albom's "Tuesdays with Morrie" provided them both with something substantially satisfying. And that's inspiring and poignant.Yet on the other hand, Albom's attempts to enlighten us transforms it into a "Hallmark" card on steroids, a rather dramatic and prolonged one that does little more to demystify the true meaning of life than offer up tired and somewhat ambiguous cliches like "love conquers all." Though an honorable sentiment, it's not markedly more substantive or instructive than the alternative, "life sucks and then you die."Let's face it. Death scares the *%(^ out of most of us...as it should, especially when you consider that no one really knows what it's like to be dead, if it's like anything at all. Add to that the fact that in the grand scope of things we're all insignificant blimps/statistically insignificant(tens of thousands of people die every day around the world and yet most of their deaths go relatively unnoticed) and the glaring reality that it takes markedly more than "love" to make it through life, and these comforting cliches suddenly lose some of their "comfort."However, that doesn't mean life has to be or feel meaningless, it simply means it is up to each of us to find and give our lives meaning...whatever that may mean.Tuesdays with Morriedefinitely encourages the reader to stop and think about what is important, yet falls short of providing any new insight into how one actually figures it out for themselves and/or how we reach that balance between living as if there is a tomorrow while simultaneously realizing that, at least for some us, there won't be.Alas...3 stars. A book worth reading, but not a life-changing or even an attitude-changing one.I should add that this book might hold more appeal to someone who,like Morrie, is coming to immediate terms with his own mortality as they may find inspiration in his personal story.
