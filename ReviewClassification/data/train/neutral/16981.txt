I really like this movie and watched it before I'd ever read the book. But I remembered that this was one of the few cases where I liked both the book and the movie even where they didn't match up. I don't know that I'll read it again ever though because I did like the movie better this time around. I liked that there were just the three primary characters, for instance. And I admit that I liked that Foltrigg (while still being a loud mouth) wasn't quite the moron he is in the book-- but I'm sure that's because Tommy Lee Jones played him and wasn't willing to be such an idiot. And I'm okay with that. From the book, I liked that Dianne and Reggie seem to have a better relationship. I also love that the employer sends her flowers. I was annoyed, though, about the random court reporter and her skirt. Sometimes the sex junk-- totally irrelevant to the story-- annoys me a lot and this time it did especially. So the story is great, high-speed, likeable characters, good background, but then you just gotta go throw in a little trash to sell more. Yeah, annoyed me. I admit it. So, like the story and really like Mark, Reggie, and Dianne, but it will be a long time before I read it again.
