A simple but profound story of how one small toy velveteen rabbit becomes "real" (through so-called nursery magic and because the velveteen rabbit is perceived as being real by the young boy who sleeps with it every night and plays with it every day), but I do have to admit that I am actually more than a bit glad I did NOT encounter Margery Williams Bianco's classic as a very young child (for I did indeed and very much akin to the Boy own a stuffed rabbit toy that was in many ways exactly the same kind of constant companion as is featured in theVelveteen Rabbitand quite frankly, I am rather sure I would have majorly and totally out at the scene where the doctor orders all of the Boy's books and toys, including his velveteen rabbit, to be burned because of the scarlet fever infection risk, with the fact of the physician more than likely being right with regard to the need to sanitise and disinfect the Boy's bedroom, including getting rid of certain very much contaminated and germ-ridden toys and books quite notwithstanding).And also, really, and with my apologies to those of you who considerThe Velveteen Rabbita total childhood favourite, reading the book always makes me (on a personal and emotional level) feel rather frustrated with and even a bit angry at the Boy. For if this had been MY toy rabbit, I absolutely and definitely would have at least verbally and with angry tears rebelled and loudly complained at having my toys and books (and especially my favourite stuffed animal) burned (even if ordered by the doctor, even if for legitimate and realistic reasons, and truth be told, although as an adult, I do understand and appreciate why the doctor feels that the Boy's scarlet fever exposed books and toys need to be destroyed in order to keep potential reinfection at bay, I have still always despised the doctor's rather callous attitude and words, for they just seem so very coldly unfeeling and careless, they seem to consider the velveteen rabbit that is supposed to be burned as just some random and unimportant toy). But then again, even the Boy himself seems rather nonchalant at best towards what is happening, being described by Margery Williams Bianco as considerably more excited about and hankering after his promised recuperative trip to the seashore than in any way being sad about or angry at the doctor having ordered his treasured toys and books, including his constant velveteen rabbit companion, to be incinerated.And indeed to and for me, the ending ofThe Velveteen Rabbit(with the toy rabbit actually being turned by the fairy into a real, into a bona fide bunny rabbit) is therefore and actually in many ways really quite massively bittersweet and even a bit painful. For the stuffed rabbit was totally and utterly real to the Boy because he considered his velveteen rabbit as real, he perceived it as being a true rabbit and a true friend, but in some ways (at least in my opinion), that very magical type of reality seems to kind of leave and disappear at the end, when the Boy just and simply accepts with not even one word of complaint and protest the doctor's orders that his toys must be destroyed, that even his special rabbit toy must be burned (and while I am well aware of the fact that I am more than likely imposing my own personal feelings here, I do stand by how I have always felt readingThe Velveteen Rabbit, and that the Boy just calmly, without protest seems to accept his stuffed rabbit toy needing to be destroyed, this has indeed and in fact always somewhat majorly chafed and has also therefore generally left me more than a bit uncomfortable and unsatisfied with regard to Margery Williams' Bianco'sThe Velveteen Rabbit).
