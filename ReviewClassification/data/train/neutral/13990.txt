Popular self-help books have the most misleading titles.Men are From Mars Women are from Venus, for example, promises a provocative thesis but proves a bland and repetitive read. By contrast,The 7 Habits of Highly Effective Peopleenlightens the mind and tugs at the heart despite its dry label.And so it is withHow to Win Friends and Influence People. The title suggests cloak-and-dagger tactics. 'Winning friends' implies competition; that if you don't win them someone else will! And 'influencing people' implies trickery; how to get them to do what's best for you, instead of what's best for themselves.Yet the content of the book proves warm and friendly. Tips include admitting fault when you've erred, showing sincere interest in other people and putting effort into learning their names. These ideas are supported by a series of heartwarming anecdotes from historical figures and ordinary people from Carnegie's day. The overall theme is that if you do right by others they'll do right by you.Toward the end, there's a suggestion or two that feel like psychological tricks. For example, there's a chapter on that old sales tactic of asking a lot of yes/no questions (Are you feeling well today? Have you used a product like ours before?) to get someone saying 'yes' so they'll be primed to say 'yes' once you start your sales-pitch. But these were exceptions to the rule and felt mild compared with what I was expecting.I have to wonder why the book wasn't named 'How tomakefriends andget along withpeople?' I guess the sneakier title helps attract competitive business types; roping them in with the promise of shady tactics before giving them flowers and sunshine. The title implies underhanded schemes but may be the most underhanded element of the book.Edited 5-21-2017
