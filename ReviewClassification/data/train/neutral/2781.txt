I like the book better than the movie.the struggle of jamie and langdon for their love over death...sounds cliche, but i think the book is the second best romance story next to Love Story by Erich Segal.try to read it at 2 am in the morning when all you hear is silent and you'll get into the story until you burst into tears...i smiled.i cried.nice.
