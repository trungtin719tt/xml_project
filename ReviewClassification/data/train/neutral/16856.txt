I thought I would like this old favorite a lot more than I did. I don't think this one made the transition from the 19th century to the 21st century very well at all. The book is about twice as long as it needs to be, thanks to wandering and bewildering dialogue. The story itself is unlikely; Cooper would have us believe that the Hurons were extremely lenient with their prisoners, letting them wander about unraped and untortured and permitting them to be rescued time and again. If you want a book on torture, pass this one by and pick up something on Abu Ghraib or Guantanamo Bay.I know the book has long been considered a classic, and Mr. Cooper shows a talent for descriptive prose, but I don't think it suits the modern reader very well at all. Maybe I'm jaded from over-exposure to explicit media, but this is one of the very few times you will see me declare that the movie was an improvement on the book.
