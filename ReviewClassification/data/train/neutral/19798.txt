*possible spoilers here* MUCH more likable characters in this book than in "Master of the Game". Tracy - a pretty, innocent young thing - tries to recover stolen property on the behalf of her mother (who killed herself in shame at letting herself be swindled out of her life savings). Before the first two chapters are over, Tracy's been framed, tricked into pleading guilty and then sentenced to fifteen years by a corrupt judge. Her rich fiancee dumps her to avoid associating with a felon (despite the fact that she's pregnant with his child), she suffers a misscarriage, and her whole life has been reduced to fending off sexual assaults in prison. And that's when the fun begins, because the rest of the book is about Tracy's schemes to recover her life, get revenge on the ones who betrayed her, and start her new life as a professional thief. Lots of fun, several clever schemes, some sex, plenty of intrigue, and MANY people getting what's coming to them.
