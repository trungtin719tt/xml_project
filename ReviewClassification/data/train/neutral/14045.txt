Adrian strikes again. Well, with his dry humor and whiplash attitude!Aside from that, it was bit of drag - to be frank it was bit of disappointment up until 80%.Nothing really happens and I felt bit bored. By the time action started, I was like 'okay I see your point' but wasn't enough for me. *sigh*But throughout, there are few moments of entertainment. I specially enjoyed when(view spoiler)[Bryden broke up with Sydney. Her reaction was priceless and I found myself laughing along with her.(hide spoiler)]I already started with 'The Indigo Spell' so hope I might see more action than this one.
