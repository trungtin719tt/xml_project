I guess I must be in a deep dark classic book hole right now.Island of the Blue Dolphinshonestly sounded a bit better than it actually turned out to be. I feel like it was because of the pacing. The beginning was so freaking slow. It almost put me to sleep and I was counting down the seconds until I was done with this book. Thankfully, it did get a bit better towards the end.After meeting Karana, well I felt bad for the girl. She's alone on this island, all lonely and shit. She also kind of remind me of Moana a bit? Maybe it's because I recently watched this movie but the whole boat trip out to see thing.. just made sense to me. Unlike Moana, she's afraid of the water and this journey because she's all by herself. At least Moana ran into Maui.. and she had that weird chicken. Plus the ocean.Now, me.. I like the ocean.. but I can't swim and I have a normal fear of sharks. So yeah, I would not have volunteered as tribute for this little adventure.Besides all of that, I liked that she made creature friends on the island but I was a bit bored with this book.
