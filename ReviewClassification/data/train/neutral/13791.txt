It is hard to choose a rating for this book as there were things I really liked about it and things that really turned my stomach. "Like" doesn't really cut it as a rating but, well there you go.I love the eccentric characters and the quirky, laugh-out-loud dialogue. As I noted when I read A Widow for One year, Mr. Irving is a very fine writer, better than most; however, as I also noted before, he comes across as sexually obsessed and twisted, certainly he and I are not sharing the same "family values", at least in regards to matters of intimacy. This doesn't really express how abhorrent some of his scenes are. In some ways I felt he had things in common with his terrorist/anarchist/pornographer character. Some of his scenes feel like a violation, a rape of the reader and a deliberate attempt to degrade, to my mind anyway.Despite this author's amazing talent in writing I still thought some of the scenes were stupid, especially the "bear in heat" scene. That struck me as a failure in writing, both as a revenge or an absurdity, as it was neither satisfying or funny. I also didn't like how the book ends for Lilly, it seemed like a cheap ending, a cheat by the author almost. I felt Mr. Irving could have done better by her, but maybe he was making a point, "posing" her in imitations of another famous writer.What I liked best about the book was the dialogue and the characterization, and how imaginative Mr. Irving is. I also liked the relationship between John and his father and grandfather, and how John helps his father with the fulfillment of his dream after they come back from Europe. He writes with an amazing sense of the absurd and this is what kept me reading.
