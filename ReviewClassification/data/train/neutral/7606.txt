For some reason, I didn't likeLa Pestenearly as much I had expected. In fact, I found it pretentious and annoying. Maybe I should re-read it... I have a feeling I missed something. My thoughts during the first reading were that he was way too pleased with himself for having been a hero of the Resistance, and that I no longer found it very odd that Sartre had had a major falling out with him which ended with them no longer speaking to each other.*************************************************After some recent discussions with a few of the millions of people who worship this book, I have been racking my brains to try and figure out what I have against it. The most convincing theory I can come up with is that I read it shortly after Winston Churchill's History of the Second World War. Given Camus's life story, it certainly seemed to me thatLa Pestewas intended as an allegory of what the French Resistance did in WW II. Churchill is pretty dismissive of the Resistance and the Free French - he never quite says so outright, but it's clear he thought de Gaulle was a major pain in the ass, and that this was more a political side-show than any real contribution towards winning the war.So I think Camus got side-swiped here... I just kept thinking, roughly, OK, but these doctors are irrelevant, the real action is taking place in Stalingrad, Midway and el Alamein. Now that I write it down, I see that I am being very unfair to him, the story is in fact quite timeless. But I couldn't shake off the associations.Since it's clear that no one in the world agrees with me on this, I made up a couple of fictional characters who do. You can meet them in my parody,A Tribute to Robin Baker's "Sperm Wars".
