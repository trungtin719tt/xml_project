I suppose I should provide some kind of explanation as to why I didn't finish reading this book.It's not because the concept was stupid - actually the concept was quite interesting and would make for a fantastic philosophical discussion.It's not because it was poorly written - actually it was written quite well with a great plot and interesting world building and action packed scenes.It's not because the characters were horrible or annoying - Actually, Sam is really likable if not frustrating, Astrid is such a relief as a female protagonist and the secondary characters are realistic and well fleshed out.In the end I would actually recommend this book to people, especially fans of sci-fi and particularly middle-school children. It's like a modern, sci-fi version of Lord of the Flies only cooler and there's no Piggy.No, the reason I couldn't keep reading it was because I wasn't enjoying it. The reason I wasn't enjoying it was rather stupid but since everyone over the age of 15 is gone, I was kind of frustrated because there was only one girl and boy actually taking care of a small number of babies. The rest were just being abandoned in their cars/houses or whatever and I couldn't get absorbed in the storytelling while I was mentally yelling at the kids to go rescue the babies!Stupid, I know. Pathetic? Yeah, I'm WELL aware of it, but that's just the way it is.Also, because I'm kind of an authoritarian/leader type person, I was thinking of everything they SHOULD be doing and how they SHOULD be organizing and kind of frustrated that Sam was being so wimpy about taking charge. But, he's fourteen, I know he deserves slack but yeah...SO go read it, please! My inability to finish this book had nothing to do with the writing and was all about me being irrational and crazy!
