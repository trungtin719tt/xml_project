As much as I found interesting the fact that this had a dark vibe going on the entire time, I must say that I was completely let down by the writing. I don't know if it is because it's the author's first book but I guess that must be it. The story was equal parts intriguing and confusing, so I have mixed feelings about this entire book. I struggled giving a rating to this. I wasn't sure if it deserved 3 stars or 2 but I'll say that I'm somewhere in between.Aislinn is a mortal, she has the Sight, which means she can see the faeries. She's always been able too and her grams always advised her to not let them know that she could see them because faeries can be unpredictable and vicious. Keenan is the Summer King, he's royalty and his mother is the Winter Queen so that means they are enemies. He's been trying to find the girl that will touch the winter staff without being consumed by the Queen's frost and so far he's only failed.It's a multi-changing perspective book. There are four characters narrating the story. Aislinn is one, Keenan another, Donia who is the last girl who touched the winter staff and got consumed by the frost and now she's partially a ghost, and lastly, Seth, Aislinn's boyfriend of sorts.This book has its pros and cons. It's fast-paced and the story evolves quickly, there are multiple p.o.v's so one does not get bored easily but it's not that well-written and the story can get baffling, to say the least.I'm sure that whoever reads this, they'll enjoy it. You may won't love it, I didn't either. But I'm intrigued enough, by the ending and the twists, that I'm going to be reading the next book in the series and hope for the best.
