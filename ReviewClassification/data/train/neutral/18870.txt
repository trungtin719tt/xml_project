This is a decent book about a fictional community where the government controls everything. The people are only allowed to have 2 children so anything after 2 they hide them. This is a story about a boy that has been hidden his entire life and find out that there are other hidden children out there as well. He meets a girl and they become friends.I have mixed feelings about this book. The reason I read it was because a friend of mine asked me about it. Her 11 year-old son read it and he was upset and sad about some things in the book. She was kind of shocked and upset that he read such a book. So I read the book as a favor to her to see what kind of book it really was. So I honestly cannot say if I think it is appropriate for 11 year-olds. I probably would let mine read it but now that she has brought it to my attention I am kind of hesitant about what I really think.Don't know if that made any sense at all-Sorry..
