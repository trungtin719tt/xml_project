Reading Shakespeare is almost like going down into the basement of literature and examining the foundations.So often I find the origins of what has become trite and overdone, and yet Shakespeare was the fountain from which so much springs. This is especially true of Twelfth Night, it is apparent that so many comedies and romances over the centuries were heavily influenced by this play.Very entertaining.
