So I love Diana Gabaldon. I wish she would write faster than one new book every four years in the Outlander series, but whatcha gonna do. So Of course I've been waiting with bated breath for this one.Writing: still draws you into the characters' lives. They are so human, so loving, so flawed yet continuously striving.Characters: this book has four main plots (yes, four). We get Jamie and Claire, but we also get Ian (who I like to read about), Roger and Brianna (who I found annoying earlier in the series but now really am enjoying), and William and Lord John. That last plot thread really plods. I don't get the sense of empathy with these two characters that I can get with the others. There's lots of plotting and intrigue that really doesn't amount to much. I think the author is a frustrated mystery writer, but the mystery parts of her books don't do nearly as much for me as the time travel, romances, adventure, history, and humor.Plot: I don't know if I can forgive her for this. She wrote a great book and then failed to end it. Three of the four plots threads end with characters in terrible danger or a major unresolved issue. Why would she do this? In a book that's 800 pages long, it's not like she worries much about editing. Couldn't she write another 50 to 100 pages and get them out of those messes? The cliffhangers are ridiculous when we will probably have to wait another 4 years to see them resolved. No matter how much tension she generates, four years will make it die down. I can't write in any dignified way how upset I am by this- it's cheap, a cheat, and unfair to her faithful readers.
