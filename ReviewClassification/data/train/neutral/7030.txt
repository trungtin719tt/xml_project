3 conflicted stars !Gosh I struggled with this book.Is this book well written? No doubt about it.Is this book overwritten and too stylized? At times, yes it was.Were the stories wonderfully original? Yes they were.Did the stories fail to move me? Alas, they did.This was the main crux of the matter. The stories did not resonate with me one bit. At times I could enjoy them but I found them so empty and unsatisfying. These stories were intellectually brilliant but emotionally bankrupt. (there I said it and I apologize as I am aware of how many people adored this book.)I'm glad I read it but I am more relieved that the book is over.
