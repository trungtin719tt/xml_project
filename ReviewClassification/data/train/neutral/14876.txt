Things I hated about this book: its length and Kiera!!! There are many long books that you don't want to miss even a sentence. This book was definitely NOT one of them. It was so repetitive that it felt more like a diary;"Kiera being infatuated with Kellan's looks. Kiera flirting with Kellan and leading him on, falsely. Kellan is hot, sensual. Kellan is a player. Kellan and Kiera say good morning. Make coffee. Add sugar. ETC..." Urg! I just wanted to slap Kiera across the face and yell at her for being so damn eccentric! She couldn't choose because she was guilty, afraid of not being safe. Her emotions were everywhere. Such a weak heroine! She surely didn't deserve Kellan or Denny. Urg!!Thing I loved about this book: Kellan Kyle, although I still never figured out what gorgeous singer like he saw in Kiera in the first place that made him endure all of the emotional torture and hurt just to be with her. Some girls are just so damn lucky!
