I snagged this trilogy during an ebook sale in late September 2011. I had already read the first novel, theHunger Games(click here for my review) in April 2010, and really hadn't planned on continuing. But the sale price was just too good to pass up.I startedCatching Fireon October 13th (no it wasn't a Friday) and should have it finished before the ides of October 2011. As promised, I finished reading the second novel on October 15th (click here for my review).I startedMockingjayon October 20th and finished it on Sunday, the 23rd. For my thoughts on the final installment,please read my review found here.Overall, I will rate this series three stars via GoodReads (since I gave the first and last books three stars and the middle book four stars), but 3.5 stars using my own rating system.I really can't recommend this series to young adults (I would treat it like an R-rated movie for my own kids, were they still teenagers), due to the violence, gore and lack of inspiring elements. Katniss is not a character I would want my daughter to emulate.
