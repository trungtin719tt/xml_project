Sigh. Sigh. Sigh.I read this book in one sitting. I wanted to love this book, instead I loved it and kinda...disliked it.First things first....The Great:1) multiple storyline and continuing arcs. I adore the way JR Ward juggles the storylines. We have Vishous' story front and center, we have John's ongoing arc and then we have the beginnings of Phury's story. She slides from one to the other effortlessly and keeps them so interesting that I'd didn't skip impatiently over one to get to the others. I see that she mentions Suzanne Brockmann in her dedication, another writer who does an outstanding job of keeping multiple storyline and ongoing arcs from book to book. Both ladies do serial storytelling in grand style.2) Vishous. His back story was nothing short of brilliant and harrowing. I didn't think anybody could have it worse that Zsadist. But Vishous did. I have only read the two preceding books to this one (haven't read Wrath's or Rhage's story) so the revelations about Vishous' parentage were a complete surprise to me (not sure if there were clues in earlier books). I do have to say, though, that Zsadist's story still packs a more emotional wallop to me.3) John Matthew. His continuing story keeps me absolutely riveted. Again, she is unfolding him in layers and keeping the suspense and interest very high. And his relationship with my favorite bother, Zsadist, is cherry on the top.The okay but kind of annoying.I know that people have strong opinions about the vernacular she uses. The hip, urban slang took me off guard at first but I've grown used to the brothers speaking in their own rhythm. However, when a new character also speaks that way it detracts from the characterization she's created of this closed and very close knit group and then it simply stands out as an author's tic. The doctor, Manny made a comment that made me roll my eyes. Instead of simply saying "I need to something to eat." he instead said something like "I'm going to food up." Then there was that whole Rubik's cube thing. Vishous referenced feeling like a Rubik's cube in various states of resolution.The not-so-great:Jane. I'm sorry but I simply did not feel Jane. I couldn't get a handle on her, not like I could Bella and Marisa. And it is a huge flaw in a story when the major central characters is so elusive. It felt too pat, to easy for Jane to so quickly and wholeheartedly buy into and cooperate with Vishous' demons. I didn't get a sense of unease or pause from her at all.The bad:The ending. Put me in the camp that hated the final solution of Jane/Vishous pairing. I simply hated it. I couldn't believe what I was reading and went back and re-read the last few chapters to make sure I didn't inadvertently skip an important passage or two.Ward has created her own vampire mythos where Vamps can't turn humans. It seems that she chooses to have her creations mate between "species" and then she finds loopholes to make sure the humans live as long as the vamps. I kinda think that too is too pat and easy (of course it is her mythos so she can do what she wants). But I'd actually like to see the vamp and human say "yeah, you're going to die in 50 years and I'm going to live for centuries, let's just enjoy our time we do have together."
