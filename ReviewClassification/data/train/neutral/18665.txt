Buddy read atBuddies Books and BaublesThe world building in this one was pretty good. And finally there was someone with true alpha potential(view spoiler)[I am talking about the sea fae, obv ;)(hide spoiler)].Now I do not care much about the abundant romance stuff here and about most of the side characters just yet.Getting there. 3.5 stars.
