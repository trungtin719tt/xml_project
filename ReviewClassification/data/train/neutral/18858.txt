This was very cliche but something unexpected did occur somewhere like at the middle? I read it some time now so I cant remember exactly how but I know it had something to do with fairies. Leave the fairies to Sarah J bro. The was the over cliche it guy/ hero boring. But the atmosphere is what got this book rolling for me. Gave me the good ole Twilight Forks feeling. Its definitely worth a go if you like fairies, cold weather, cliche guys and the MC who has a phobia name for every single thing.
