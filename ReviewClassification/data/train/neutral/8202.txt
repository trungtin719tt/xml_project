You spin me right round, babyRight round like a record, babyRight round round roundStill absurd. Quite ridiculous. Occasionally philosophical. However, since its completion, the comedy ofWaiting for Godothas become commonplace. Because the humor could be said to be Three Stooges-esque at times, one could say this play was even behind the times. I say itcouldbe said, not that I say it is.DoesWaiting for Godotdeserve all the attention it has received? After all, it seems to state the meaning of life while asserting life is meaningless, and that's quite a significant statement. From the mouths of the characters Vladimir and Estragon, Beckett says that nothing in life matters. However, the characters contempt suicide, and that is the ultimate matter of life. That they then neglect to do so would indicate that they believe there to be value in life. Or is it that they are just too lazy to do even this deed, which would release they from having to do anything afterwards forever and always?Ah, but look at me, foolishly trying to make sense of it all when, if anything is clear, that is surely not what Beckett intended.Instead, let me explain why this received no better than a middling rating from me. It has too many Falstaffs. When everybody's a comedian real conversation turns into a comedian's lingua franca and much of the humor's basis of being funny in the first place is lost. In other words, we laugh at the absurdity of life, but if life is absurd the humor dissipates. InWaiting for Godotthe humor dissipated too much for me. There, I said it.
