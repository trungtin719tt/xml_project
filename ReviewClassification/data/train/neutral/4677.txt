Perhaps I should be ashamed of myself for obsessing over Twilight the way I did, but I'm not going to lie about liking it. Perhaps the series would not appeal to the taste of bourgeois and elitists, who might feel that reading Twilight somehow compromise their immense intellects.I'm not a bourgeois nor an elitist, I'm a simple person who reads simply for pleasure. I just like what I like.If this one gets published I would definitely buy it. Though the main reason behind it would be totally pointless you might say. I just need to see the complete series arrange neatly together on my shelf!
