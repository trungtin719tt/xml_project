Lord of the Rings written for Middle Schoolers, but with aliens.I was looking for something easy to pick up and put down, something story driven that wouldn't be too much of a mental commitment; in that way, this book was perfect.However it felt very... done. I suppose all fantasy books have the misfortune of being compared to Lord of the Rings (the only fantasy series I've ever devoted myself to), and this one is no different. The elves, the dwarves, and goblins. There's a bit of political drama, and magic. But it felt a bit obvious. I didn't feel myself getting lost in the story. The people you wanted to live, all lived. The characters you didn't expect to make it didn't make it. At the end the good guys who make it, all get rich or a nice title. I was able to pick it up, read a chapter or two, forget about it for a while, and when I picked it up again I didn't have to re-read anything to remember what had happened, because it was all pretty predictable.I picked this book out because it made it onto NPRs best Sci-Fi and Fantasy books. Not really sure what all the hub-bub is about
