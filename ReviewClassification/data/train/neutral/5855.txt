This is the one case, the ONLY case (so far. Edit: not anymore, Bridget Jones gets the honor too), where I prefer the movie to the book. I know it's a sacrilege and you can all burn me at the stake, but it is nonetheless the truth. It's also one of the few times I watched the movie before reading the book, simply because I had no idea the book existed. And I loved the movie. I mean, really, really loved it.So of course when I discovered it was based on a book, I rushed to get it. Now, please don't get me wrong, it's a good book. It's a very very good book, and I love how Neil Gaiman tried (and succeeding at) creating a dark fairytale. Because it is very much a fairytale, except it's probably not so much for kids, as it is for adults. It shows us that fairytales aren't all glitter and roses, and good vs. evil, with happy endings for all the good guys. It's a more realistic fairytale.That seems like such a contradiction, and few other people than Neil Gaiman could make it work (so thank god he's the one who wrote it).The problem is that having watched the movie Iwanteda fairytale. All the things I loved the best about the movie, weren't in the book (and it's usually the other way around, I was surprised too). I mean, no Captain Shakespeare? No happy stars-in-the-sky ending? The movie was such a feel-good one and the book? Not so much.Had I done it in the proper order (book then movie) I'm absolutely certain I would have felt differently about it, but that's not how it is. Both book and movie are amazing in their own right, and perhaps I shouldn't even compare them, but ah, too late.Still, this is a great book and I really enjoyed it. So don't rid yourself of the chance to get to know some fantastic characters and go on a proper fairytale adventure with no risk of sugar exposure.
