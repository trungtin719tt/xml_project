Ok - Finished the book it was nice read for the series end but it was too much of a perfect ending. Don't get me wrong I am happy for Rose and Dimitri but did they have to remain guardians. I wanted them to choose themselves over duty and go start their life fighting injustice on their on term. The ending was too perfect not saying someone should have died but not every story has to have a perfect ending. If Lissa was not crowned queen or Rose and Dimiti leaving court that would have been fine. What about Robert Victor's brother, Sydney, Eddie too many unanswered questions.The comment below was written before I read the book:I think Ms. Mead can go in many directions with this last book. I would love to see Adrian as the main villian in disguise.I think Adrian killed Queen Tatiana because he wants to be King. He sees Lissa as his biggest threat to the throne. Therefore, dispose of her protector. Once Rose is out of the picture, Lissa will be an easier target. As far as his feelings for Rose, I think its a facade. She is just another Dhampir notch on his belt.Adrian could have enter the Queen's chamber unnoticed. He is her nephew and no one would suspect him of harm. Adrian is mysterious and a ticking time bomb.Dimitri may indeed be Rose knight in shining armour. Once Adrian true intentions are revealed, who will Rose look to for comfort?However, Dimitri should not ignore that Rose is a willing blood whore for Adrian.
