At a Borders parking lot back home, it was spray-painted into the pavement "READ ISHMAEL"That's basically how I first heard about it and read it. Especially since I parked over the spray-painted message time and time again.Would people really read this book if it was called "Ricardo" or "Paul"...I say no.So thanks for giving it this name that nobody has except for people obsessed with Moby Dick, which I have not come across.I think intellectuals like to say that this book changed their mind on the way they thought about things.It's from the perspective of the other side.I liked it, but didn't love it.Personally, I get agitated when people constantly pick this book or something like Herman Hesse as something that changed their life or their philosophy of things.I can't explain why, but most people I know are really limited as to what they read and they read the SAME type of books.I just want to stab them in the face since it's the same type of people who are wannabe intellectuals that say this.I certainly am not an intellectual, but I try to be.But there's a certain type of intellectual that I definitely make an attempt NOT to be.And that is people like my ex-girlfriend. Ha. There you go. It finally comes out. My ex-girlfriend ruined this book for me and has caused me to hate a legion of people in the process. Thank you.Anyways, this book was okay.
