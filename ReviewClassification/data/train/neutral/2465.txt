This was tongue tying. Too much so! Indy and I haven't read many of these, although he did ask for it off his brother's shelf. I was stumbling over my words, probably to try and get through it quickly.. this cat was too long! Made me feel tired! He's still quite cool of course. Just not for us at this reading stage. We have about ten others though on the shelf, so hopefully we will embrace them a little more.
