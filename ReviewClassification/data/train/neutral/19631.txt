I've really enjoyed most of the Cornelia Funke books that I've read, but the first time I started The Thief Lord the story felt way too typical. Why do so many children's books have orphans for main characters? I felt like I'd already read this book quite a few times. And I felt like the Thief Lord was way too arrogant to be any fun as a character. So I stopped reading after not very many pages and moved on to something else.On the plus side, this book and the question it raised about orphans in children's literature led to a very interesting conversation with a librarian friend. After abandoning this book and then having that conversation, I started an "orphans" shelf here on GR and have been tracking all of the children's books I read with orphans as characters. It's been very interesting to take note of how various children's book authors deal with parents or the absence of parents in their books.Also since then, every time this book has been checked out of my library, I've wondered if I missed anything by not finishing it. It didn't feel like anything unique in the beginning, but how could I know for sure if I didn't read it? Well, now I know. It wasn't the typical story I thought it would be. She really did bring something fresh and fun to the story. And she made me really want to go to Venice sometime! But this also isn't the book I would recommend reading first if you want to read something by Cornelia Funke. (I would recommend readingInkheartfirst.)I came to really like many of the characters. The Thief Lord wasn't as arrogant as he appeared in the beginning - although I guessed his secret LONG before it was revealed. I liked how the story progressed, but it did feel a little jarring to have a bit of fantasy take place in the last fourth of the story. Overall, though, I'm happy to cross another title off of my "unfinished" list and add another book read to my "orphans" shelf. 3.5 stars.
