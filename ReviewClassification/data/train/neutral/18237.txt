This book begins with every parent's nightmare - my child is gone and I can't find him. And that situation is compounded by the fact that Denise's 4-year-old son is a special needs child, and that she is a single parent whose every moment is wrapped up in meeting those needs.The missing Kyle is found by volunteer-fireman Taylor, and Denise discovers that there can be room in her life for someone else, especially since that someone else interacts well with her son and seems to genuinely like to be with him, and of course with Denise. But Taylor has demons of his own, traced back to the death of his father when Taylor was nine, and that apparently make it impossible for him to maintain a relationship.This was a mostly well-told tale of how life must of necessity and love revolve around the needs of a child, but this is not a romance book IMO. One thing the author did near the end of the book made me so angry that Iwill not keep or rereadthis book. It was just so unnecessary, and is the reason for the lower rating.
