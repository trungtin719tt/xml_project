Well I don't think I was quite ready for Virginia Woolf. It's my first novel by Woolf so I've finally broken my Virginia virginity. The writing is razor sharp, very witty in parts but mostly there's an energy to her writing it's slightly manic and I felt my mind racing through along with her thoughts. But did I enjoy this book? In parts. I found the pacing although the words were written beautifully a little too frenetic like she's throwing everything at you and hoping you keep up. I think this book makes you work for it, it took some time then bam it kinda hits you!She's very modern and forward thinking and I can believe that the themes of this book were quite provocative of it's time (it is set in 1923!!) she specialises in social commentary and tackles things that may have been considered risque of the times, sexuality, depression, post traumatic stress and English class hierarchy and doesn't hold back really getting the atmosphere of London during the inter-war years. I love her enthusiasm of trivial things, everything is bright and alive in this book it's all so clever but it felt too clever for me at times and felt like I needed a degree in English literature to get more from this reading experience as a whole.
