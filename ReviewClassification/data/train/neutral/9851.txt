The high-tension in the story seemingly retreated back to zero. Honestly, this is not a novel about vampires that give you that awe-struck factor when you first read it. But the last 3 novels: Betrayed, Chosen and Untamed actually gone beyond my expectations for something great in this series. The story followed an action-packed and heart pulsing pattern and that made me sit on edge. As I approached the end I thought the story is picking where it began again. The first five book seems to be the consolidation of the first quest of Zoey in defeating evil; and the following books will reveal more enemies and wars. If this intuition is true, well maybe I will understand and at least continue reading this.I like how the authors threaded many love affairs between Zoey, Loren, Erik and Stark. Despite of being at the peek of the battle between good and evil, Zoey manages to maintain the humor as she busies herself with her boyfriend agendas. I have a strong feeling that Stark character will long accompany Zoey in this series. On the other hand, Eric good-looking factor is not longer spicing things up. In the previous books, I was really thankful that there was Eric in each book, but now my attention was focus on Heath.No matter how much I want the story to be twist and turn unexpectedly: for example Heath will be marked and be a fledgling,I realized how happy I am of his mundane personality.To wrap things up, if I will be talking about this book as a game, level 1 has just ended. Evil versus good, whoever wins, we know that it's not yet the end. It's just the beginning and the darker is yet to come. I hope HoN's readers won't give up on this series, just go on and you'll discover its worth. I bet this series has a lot of surprises to come.
