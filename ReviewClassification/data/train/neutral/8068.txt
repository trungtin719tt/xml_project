This is an audiobook I am reviewing for Sound Commentary (www.soundcommentary.com) which is why I ran through the first three books so quickly. When you read quickly. you miss a certain type of detail. In audio, you have to hear it all. Which is why it was so apparent that Aphrodite was modeled after Cordelia Chase (both Buffy and Angel versions.) This isn't a bad thing, merely obvious. I also think that the authors are having trouble remembering that it's been only 2 months since Zooey was marked. When I read lines like (and I'm paraphrasing) "I'd never felt such a pull on my powers before." She's only had these powers for 2 months. Not enough to know how to use them. And it still irritates me that everything comes easy to her. Even making up with her friends wasn't that hard. There were things I loved. The nuns were priceless and completely worth the price of admission. That fact that Nyx, the Goddess, actually talks to them, is also very interesting - though no different than Buffy talking to the PTB. This story line was the season finale of Buffy, Season 3. Oh, a little different, but not really. I don't know if that would be so clear to the readers of the book but it was pretty obvious to me. I will continue to read the series because it's fun and light but it isn't living up to the promise of the first book.
