3.5/5I really enjoyed this book! Even if I enjoyed the movie more than the book.I love that this is an adult fairytale &amp; I love the comedy aspects of it, but part of it felt like a not totally complete story, whereas the movie really did bring things around.Regardless, I LOVE Neil Gaiman's writing style and storytelling. He truly is a master story teller! The audiobook was narrated by him and it made the story that much better because of it.
