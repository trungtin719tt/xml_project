I can't believe I haven't added and reviewed this one yet!! I used to be huge (HUGE) fan of Eragon so I can't think of a reason why I didn't... Anyway, self punishment aside, the third book from the inheritacne cyrcle was okay. From what I can remember it had a nice plot, but the sword crafting was way too long so it did got boring there. But other than that, the story was nice and we had some character development and some nice battles. So, 3 out of 5.
