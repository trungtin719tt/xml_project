I've had this book on my radar for a long time now. With all the rave reviews and hype surrounding this book, I had psyched myself out for a spectacular read. Unfortunately, I also set myself up for disappointment. I liked the story, but definitely didn't fall in love with it like so many of my friends did.A futuristic Cinderella story, 'Cinder' tells the story of a young cyborg mechanic. Cinder is forced to forfeit all of her earnings to her guardian, the woman that adopted her begrudgingly years ago when her husband brought Cinder home shortly before he died. Constantly reminded by her guardian that she is less than human, Cinder's daily existence is bleak.When the Prince unexpectantly seeks out Cinder's mechanical skills to fix an android, the story begins to get interesting. Of course, the prince is the object of every girl's fantasies, and he's genuinely nice. From the start, he shows Cinder a great amount of interest.With a pandemic plague terrifying Earth's population, and the wicked Lunar Queen lurking in the background, there is a constant feeling of danger in Cinder's world. Yet, despite everything, I never felt a strong connection to the story. There isn't any single thing I can put my finger on. It's a case of "It's not you, it's me".Overall, I liked the story, but didn't love it. It was sweet, but maybe too sweet for me. At some point, I might read the second book in the series. I can't help but feel like I'm missing something with all the glowing reviews that this series has received.
