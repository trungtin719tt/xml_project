I honestly have no idea how I feel about this series yet. Maybe it's because of the society that they all live in .. or maybe I'm just weird. Who knows.Specialsis the third book of theUgliesseries. Tally is a bit better in this book than she was in the previous one. Mostly because I think she's finally starting to come into her own person. She doesn't necessarily take people's shit anymore and she's starting to stand up for herself more. However, I just can fully get behind her still. I feel like she's missing something or maybe I am (ALSO WHO KNEW I WAS SO PICKY WITH CHARACTERS LATELY) but yeah, I'm hoping I will find it at some point in this series.Other than that, I know I had problems with characters in the other book.. but for some reason characters in this series reach a point where they just don't belong anymore. I don't know what it is.. but Shay and David were just so pointless to me this time around. I found myself just getting frustrated with everything and anything when it came to them.Maybe I needed wine but I can't change the past.I totally get that people like the romance of these books but it just makes me cringe at times. It's so freaking weird and now I'm just like, "Nope, go away please!" I'm honestly quite worried about the next book because I don't want to end up hating anything or anyone anymore.
