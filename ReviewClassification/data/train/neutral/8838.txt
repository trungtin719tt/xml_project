This is a strong case ofit's not you, it's me. Even though this book is wonderfully written and deals with themes I'm usually very interested in (i.e. the social position of women in the Victorian era), I never got fully invested in the story or the characters. Maybe it was just the wrong time for me to read this (October was a weird reading month for me), or maybe I would've enjoyed this slightly more if I were a little younger... Either way, it was sadly just an okay read for me.
