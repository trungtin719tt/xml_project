I wish I had read this when I was younger, because I probably would have enjoyed it more. In third grade, we were all told to read these books, but Harry Potter had just come out. Obviously, dragons and magic were more interesting than life in the Midwest, much to my teacher and my parents dismay. But back to Laura Ingalls...This book is perfect for teaching any child what life was like in the late 1800's, living in the woods trying to survive. Now, it seems utterly preposterous to live this way, but I think children would benefit from this. Rules and chores were all apart of the daily routine, and the most simplest of things were entertaining to young children. They didn't have TV or video games, they went outside and played with whatever they could find...even a pig's bladder.My main problem with this story is there is no beginning, middle or end. There is no "plot" really, and you really could have read any chapter at any time in any order. I know it's a children's book, but I read plenty of children's books that had a plot. Even Amelia Bedelia had a plot. Life in the big woods is great, but I needed something a bit more to the story.I truly expected to fly through this one, but it dragged on a bit too much for me. I think its charm didn't work on me like it did for every other little girl in my third grade class.
