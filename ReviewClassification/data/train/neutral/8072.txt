Breathe in, breathe out.I can't take it anymore. The terrible writing is giving me a head ache.I hate the character Zoey, so much. She is whiny, pathetic andSERIOUSLYannoying!! Serves her right now that she has no boyfriends. In chosen she was all:OoooO! I've got 3 boyfriends drooling on me, blahblahablah.and:Oh i feel bad, I shouldn't be doing this to Erik but I love Loren oh and wait I get horny over heath!She does not deserve Erik's forgiveness. Not one little bit and the fact that he has forgiven her should be a wake up call but no! She insists she loves every single guy who walks past her. (Stark can be a possible exception ;) )Oh look that guy is so hot! I'm going to have sex with him, Ooooo but wait! I'VE ALREADY GOT A BOYFRIEND. And now she has none!! HAHAHAH.Stupid Zoey. STUPID STUPID STUPID GIRL! I just can't take it anymore. CAN'T THE MAIN CHARACTER ATLEAST HAVE SOME PRIDE, WHAT TYPE OF WOMAN IS SHE. Words can not describe how much i hate her.But I guess it was better than Chosen, I was so happy when Heath was horrible to Zoey. I was like: OOOOOOO IN YOUR FACE!I also liked this book because of Stark, I hope he comes back in Hunted. If it wasn't for this book then I don't think I would want to read Hunted. I want to know if Stark comes back? Does she get with Erik? Does Heath apologize?I just hope Hunted isn't a dissapointment like the last rubbish book but don't get me wrong I really did like Untamed!
