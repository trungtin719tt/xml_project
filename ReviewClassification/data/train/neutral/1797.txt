Although, I can't read my handwriting so now I have to go through the book. Well, I guess I could just look at the Contents at the front. Duh, if I can still read my handwriting. I don't know why I wrote it on freaking post-its!Stories1. The Murders In The Rue Morgue2. The Mystery of Marie Roget3. Ligeia4. The Tell-Tale Heart5. MS. Found in a Bottle6. Berenice7. The Fall of the House of Usher8. The Pit and the Pendulum9. Morella10. The Oblong Box11. The Premature Burial12. The Imp of the Perverse13. The Facts of the Case of M. Valdemar14.
