I was hoping I'd feel relief after finishing this series, but honestly I wish I just hadn't finished the series. Book 3 was my favorite and it was just a meh series from there on out. The main reason I dislike this series is because I think Rose is SOOOO annoying and immature. Thinking that maybe she would develop throughout the series, I kept giving her second chances, but she's just as childish and impulsive in book 6 as she was in book 1. This book's plot was kinda boring and I found it predictable a little bit and I really found myself not caring too much about the drama and mystery. I was ready for it to be over, because you were able to piece together how it would end pretty quickly. Would I recommend this series? No. Do I think I'll pick up Bloodlines, the spin-off? Probably not.
