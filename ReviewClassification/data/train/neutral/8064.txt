2.5 "Well, this is getting old" stars...So much potential...Things have gotten bad for Zoey Redbird inUntamed, book 4 of theHouse of Nightseries. In one week she has gone from having 3 boyfriends to none and from having a trusted group of friends to being an outcast.From the cover:"Zoey's adventures at vampyre finishing school take a wild and dangerous turn as loyalties are tested, shocking true intentions come to light and an ancient evil is awakened."My thoughts...Meh. Same ol', same ol' dragging the story out, and polluting it with the unnecessary overuse of the 'f' word so prevalent in these books. I'm not a prude by any stretch, but I feet like the author is targeting a very specific audience and trying to show how cool and grown up her characters are because they pepper their vocab with the 'f' bomb.Like I said; So much potential, but just falls short.2.5 stars
