I haven't read Peter Pan before, until now and had to read it because of my next to-read book as it is a retelling of Peter Pan. While reading the book I felt boring so I left few sentences unread. I don't know exactly why I didn't enjoy the book, sometimes it may be because I was too late to read this book during my early teens.
