[Italian translation of course!]I give this one 3 1/2 stars. I thoroughly enjoyed the book -- the philosophical observations, the interweaving of the thoughts of the concierge with those of the precocious young Paloma, the idea that Art is important -- but, but... in the end, it just felt too, I don't know, constructed, thought out. Like I can see the author taking all the things she does in her own life ( drinking tea, watching Ozu, getting all spiritual and zen over art) and transferring it to her characters. I also wasn't sure what to make of the ending. Destiny makes us, or create your own destiny? Recently I've come to think that maybe I like troublesome endings.....
