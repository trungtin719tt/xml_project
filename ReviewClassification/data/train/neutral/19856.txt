I've been reading this book for a long time, only managing it in fits and starts. Partly this was because I found the ancient sections about Rumi and Shams much more interesting than the existential crisis of a modern housewife, but also because this book made me thoughtful and contemplative. The discussions based around the Forty Rules are the kind that necessitate stepping outside the framework of the novel and applying the concept to you own life, to see how it fits with what you already believe. The smaller tales/aphorisms within the novel, told mostly by Shams, offer as many questions as answers, but always make you think.Yet I was far from convinced that words equated with actions within the novel.(view spoiler)[In particular, Ella (said housewife) 'transforms' by leaving her husband and children for a man she barely knows, going from being nothing more than a reflection of those around her, to what we are supposed to believe is her real self. To me, this seemed nothing more than another form of reflection, simply transference to a new person, Aziz, and the religious beliefs that he held. In her need to escape the life she built and has become trapped in, she attaches herself to another person. Is that true personal transformation? I think we are supposed to believe she is following love, but it rang false and seemed to undermine the true love/friendship that the author was trying to show between Rumi and Shams.(hide spoiler)]In any case, one good thing to come out of reading this is a desire to find out more about Rumi, to read his works, and see for myself what kind of lessons he has to teach.
