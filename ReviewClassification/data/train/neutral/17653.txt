So... *awkward pause*How many of you little sisters out there have come to a point in your life when you look at your older brother and think "Yeah, I'd hit that," and not in thepunch-you-in-the-armkind of way?Raise your hand. No one? Oh - you haven't?! Really? Are you sure?!Well, maybe it's for the best that you've never thought about your sibling like that. And maybe you wouldn't be interested in this book. Or maybe you still would... Let's see, shall we?Now, I'm going to be very blunt about the premise of this book. This book involvesincest. It is a graphic depiction of a brother and sister who struggle with their personal lives as a result ofDisappearing Parent Syndrome. They begin to fall for and explore each other, physically and emotionally.There is actually a condition called "genetic sexual attraction" that can lead to relatives (most commonly, those who meet as adults) to be sexually attracted to each other and may possibly be a result of attraction to similar facial structure. You might know a famous almost-couple whomay or may nothave suffered from this condition...And, of course, there arethe Royalswho would take a look at their first cousin and think "Man, I need to get me a piece of THAT."Or rather... more accuratly, "Cheerio! I say I shall fancy a bit of the rumpy pumpy with that lass."Incest has a very long and sordid history. As long as there are relatives, there will be incest. Unless humans soon evolve into a Vulcan-like race that suppress their emotions and always base their decisions upon logic. Which soundsmostillogical.Who should read this:Let's just say that "brotherly love" or "sisterly love" is not for everyone. In fact, it's not formostpeople. Firstly: The large majority of siblings just aren't interested in each other. Second: If everyone participated in it - the human race would quickly devolve and be lost into genetic disorder. That's just genetics.Sorry, I just seriously can't stop with the Star Wars thing.I suggest that only MATURE teens read this.It would be completely accurate for me to say that I have NEVER read a book like this in my life. Forbidden is the verydefinitionof sexual tension.Let's face it. Teens have raging hormones. I know I did. I would have in NO way been able to handle this book as a young teen. I already wanted to do all kinds of naughty things without having an influence like this in my life, and I know that if I had read it before I had matured hormonally - I would have rushed out and tried to seduce the first "off limits" guy I could find. And I could have done a lot of damage to myself and other people. I was not emotionally mature enough to handle this book then and many young girls will be in the same situation that I was.It is difficult to say for sure how or to whom this book should be marketed. This is a youngadultbook with ADULT content. I am in no way an advocate of censorship, but honestly some teens are just NOT ready for the material in this book. It's just my recommendation that this book not be taken lightly. This isn't the new generation's Princess Bride. This book deals with things that not every teen needs to or would want to read about. All I'm saying is please, please - use discretion. Teens need to decide whether they are really interested and prepared for this book; they may even need help making their decision.Obviously, if a teen wants to read about certain issues, they will probably find a way. But I get the feeling that a lot of people wouldn't necessarily realize just how graphic this book turns out to be without researching beforehand.Personally, I really enjoyed it and couldn't put this book down. But I am an adult. Not to mention anonly child.Sometimes discouraging teens from doing something can lead to more curiosity on their part. But you could always use reverse psychology. If a parent said something like, "Oh, all my friends are reading that in book club, Hun," what teen wouldn't immediately put that book back on the shelf without even opening it. Just sayin'.If you have a sibling close to your own age and never want to think of them as anything other than a sibling, maybe you should avoid this book. I have zero brothers and sisters, so I can't speak to whether or not this could change the way someone sees their brother or sister.What I got out of this book:I liked the book and story, apart from almost all of the characters being absolute douches most of the time, particularly the mother. The pace was involving and addictive, but I'm still rather disturbed by the whole thing. Maybe that's the point?Mostly, I'm left wondering what the message of this book is. That sex is bad and bad things happen because of it? Or that incest shouldn't be illegal?I guess what I took from it was that perhaps if people weren't so intolerant and judgmental, others wouldn't be driven to self-destruction so easily. Judgement not only hurts those it is directed toward, it can also hurt those doing the directing. Intolerance is a slow-working parasite, draining the empathy and joy out it's host and replacing it with it's own fear and discontent.Intolerance is just fear in disguise. And you know what that means. Fear leads to anger... Anger leads to hate... Hate leads to suffering.I'm not a big fan of judgement.I was judged most of my adolescent life, so I'm going to skip over any morality issue. No one is taking advantage of anyone else in this book. There isn't forcefulness or blackmail. It is just an anomaly of love. Or an anomaly of lust.Despite the blunt statement at the beginning of this review, honestly, I don't think this book is aboutincest. It's about making the best of a bad situation. It's about overcoming the struggles of abandonment and loneliness.Sadly, it is all too common an occurrence. Disappearing fathers, mothers chasing their youth and social lives instead of their children, and the kids, left to pick up the pieces of their broken family.________________________________________On a lighter note: apparently, this book has already awakened non-existent latent desires inme, an adult in a committed relationship, because the other night I had a dream that I had a step-brother and that I was totally making out with him in public. Not quite as awkward as a biological brother, but still pretty damn awkward. Then, of course, there is the possibility that my latent desires had nothing to do with the step-brother and everything to do with being inpublic. Yeah, that sounds much better...let's go with that.
