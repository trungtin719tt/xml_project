This book was pretty good!!! But after the next few books, THIS SERIES WAS DNF-ED. -_-So here's the average girl who gets sent to this mysterious school, and then.....you know it!!A HOT DUDE COMES IN AND SWOOPS HER AWAY.THAT'S IT.So yes, this is ur typical story about a girl getting hypnotized by averybad boy.But don't worry, now's where the 'action' comes in! We've got a crazy girl, a hot sex god, and her awesome and ridiculous friends.(.........this is going to go great...............)However, this book has mystery, angels, and all that suspense and FEELZ.It wasn't too bad for me, but people's, I hope you enjoy the next few books. This series started getting slower and slower and if you hate reading meaningless words................-_-......YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.But besides the point that this was a total fail for me, the first book was definitely enjoyable!!You guys will (hopefully) like it. ;)
