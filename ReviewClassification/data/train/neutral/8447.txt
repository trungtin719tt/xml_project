There isn't anything that I can write that will properly describe this book. The characters, the scenery, the crime and the trial are all together described with beauty and it will leave a powerful impression on you.The anti-Japanese attitudes that were rampant in this time are a major part of the story and the author does a phenomenal job of conveying this honestly.
