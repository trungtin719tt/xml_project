*4.25 TIME TRAVELING STARS*Well, this was quite interesting and unique! I haven't read anything like this yet! I didn't love it as much as other young adult books out there, but I think that's mainly because I listened to this as an audiobook, which I've never done before. It took me a while to get used to the reader's posh British accent but eventually I really got into it! The story is centered in England so it was kind of fitting anyway.First of all, I loved the whole time traveling idea and it was thought out beautifully! I've never read a book about time travel before, and I loved that it wasn't scientifical but just something that occurs in Gwyneth's family when some chosen people reach a certain age.All the events happening in this book were really exciting, from Gwyneth discovering it's her possessing the time travel gene and not her cousin Charlotte, to all the funny and sometimes scary situations she encounters during her expected and sometimes unexpected time travels, to Gwyneth seeing dead people's ghosts... Everything had me yearning for more and I wonder how it all connects!What I didn't like however, were practically all the major characters. The side characters, like Leslie, James, Gwyneth's mom, Lucy, Paul, and even Charlotte, were all pretty interesting and likeable. They were all unique and a big part of what made this story so good. Butoh dear gods, I didn't like Gwyneth and Gideon at all! Gwyneth acted like a scared, whiny and clueless little girl most of the time, which annoyed me to death! I sincerely hope she'll grow some backbone soon. Gideon however is just a bossy, cocky prick andI don't trust him one bit! I really hope to see some major character development in the next books.All in all, I liked it but I didn't love it. I'm going to listen to the next two audiobooks anyway though! They really can't leave me hanging like this after ending Ruby Red with a kissing scene, ugh! I'd love to read more aboud Gwyneth's supposedmagicas well.
