Ode to the Paper Book: Holding a paper book in yours hands,smelling it ,feeling the pages as you flip them.Touching the cover.Looking back as you pass the bookshelf at an old friend.No, a computer can never replace that!A machine, cold ,impersonal,dead!As long as there are people in this crazy world of ours , the paper book shall survive!-Jonathan Livingston Seagull is a different kind of bird.He would rather fly as high as possible,than catch a fish.Recklessly diving,for fun, he cheats death many times.Of course Jonathan is an outcast who the others shun.Taught by an elder seagull about spiritualism(bird style),J.L.S. reaches gull heaven soon after(no he doesn't die). The seagulls big activity in paradise is to sit on a cliff, contemplating their navels, or wings or something like that(might sound a little strange to humans?).Bored, he begins teaching others. His followers begin calling Jonathan ,Son of the Great Gull, who else? Will he return to his flock back on Earth?And spread,not his wings, but the word?
