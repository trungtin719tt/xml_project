I am appalled by the worldview presented in this book. Yet the circumstances surrounding Ingrid, a poetess who goes to prison for murder are so artificial!I don't want to squirm when I'm reading, and I read for pleasure. Is there a market for books like this? Of course there is. And I've got nothing against people who like this book. But should they lap it up like it's licorice?The book is also about foster homes and what can go wrong. I just don't think that the author should be so fake in her plotting in an attempt to fake verisimilitude. I did like it on some level.This book is similar to books by Khaled Hosseini. It's a compliment, but at the same time, a denial.
