It's a sad reminder how times change when you approach the bookstore with a gleam in your eye of rediscovering a childhood favorite only to find that they no longer carry it. That was my recent experience where instead of finding Laura Ingalls Wilder and L.M. Montgomery I found vampires, sorcery, and scantily clad teenagers glaring at me from overly bright and shiny bookcovers.I will not claim that the Anne series is monumental fiction but it was too me. I wonder if youth today are getting in their own reading what I so very much treasured in the books of my childhood. In twenty years will they fondly remember those manga (?) books or recall the great vampire trend? Will they be the ones saying how times have changed? Probably.I love Anne. She is simple and complex she is delightful and innocent. I would love to be just like her minus the red hair. She lives in beautiful environments and has an amazing time wherever she goes.I guess there will always be crud sold as literature which is what I called all those books taking over the precious spots my Anne should have been in, but wasn't it I who loved R.L. Stines Fear Street series twenty years ago too? And isn't it I who have wonderful memories of reading that crud as a kid? I guess so.
