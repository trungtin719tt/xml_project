3.5/5This is a quick and easy read. As with the other Ellen Hopkins books I have read, this too is written in verse. It tells the story of a teenaged girl who grows up in a Mormon family and discovers the true meaning of love when she is sent away to live with her aunt (a less religiously devout member of her family) for a summer.
