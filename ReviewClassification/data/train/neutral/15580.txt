3.5 stars rated down.This one was pretty strange, not gonna lie. Someone I used to know always raved about this book as not only being their favourite Chuck Palahniuk book of all time, but their favourite book in general of all time. I didn't really research much before I finally decided to pick it up and I'm kind of glad that I didn't.This books was weird. It was written in a weird way and I liked that...I think? Part of me enjoyed this book and then another part of me is just really confused at what I just read. The characters weren't necessarily likeable by any means, yet I still wanted to learn more about them. The storyline itself was so strange and over-the-top, but at the same time...it was really unique.Would I call this novel one of my favourites of all time? Nah, but it was still pretty entertaining in its own strange way...
