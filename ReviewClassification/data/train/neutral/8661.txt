Solid 3 star read. I liked it enough to want to continue the series.What I liked:- Ash- Puck- Grimalkin- The various fae creatures were well-represented and varied- Imaginative, creative, and like a fairy-taleWhat I didn't like so much:- This is very PG-rated (with maybe a few PG-13 moments) and geared to younger YAs. There is nothing wrong with that! I just think I might be getting too old and like grittier stories. I think I prefer the author's Immortal Rules series, although I have only read the first one.There were a couple of little nit-picky things I won't even go into because they really didn't bother me that much. I could have liked Meghan more, but it's an origin story, so there is plenty of room for growth and change.Buddy read with myMacHalochicks.Previous post:Does this have an Alice in Wonderland vibe thing going on, or is it just me?Original post:Looks like everyone has already read this (but me).
