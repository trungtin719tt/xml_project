Fat Charlie (his dad gave him the nickname (it's a sore spot)) spent his entire life absolutely mortified by his dad.Of course, everyone's parents are embarrassing. It goes with the territory. The nature of parents is to embarrass merely by existing, just as it is the nature of children of a certain age to cringe with embarrassmentThen his dad does the unthinkable - hehad the nerve to die.Now Fat Charlie has to go back to America for the first time in years and midway through the funeral - he discovers something wholly unexpected and almost equally embarrassing -his dad was a God.Everybody going to be dead one day, just give them time.We follow Fat Charlie (Anansi's son) as he becomes immersed into the world of the Gods - from discoveringprimitive magic to his secret brother.His life is thrown into chaos - his fiancee leaves him,his brother swoops her upand Fat Charlie is set up to take the fall for a very terrible person. All the while, he has to deal with the fallout from his dad's embarrassing death.While thisbook takes place in the same world as American Gods- there is hardly any overlap. This could be read this one as a standalone. I was disappointed that my favorite characters (Shadow and the new gods) don't make an appearance. Theplot progressed at a glacial pacebut once it started ramping up, I was hooked - there were so many side plots that were masterfully interwoven.I did enjoy thatFat Charlie had more personalitythat Shadow (from the first novel) but I still preferred Shadow. Much of the charm and magical realism from the first book didn't have as much of an impact as it did before - perhaps because of the limited characters. My absolute fave character? Fat Charlie's fiance's mother -she was such a bitter, shriveled prune(I loved it!).The Finer Books Reading Challenge - 2018 Reading Challenge: A book that switches perspectivesBlog|Instagram|Twitter
