I am highly torn over whethether to give this three or four. If I had the choice, it'd be 3.5, so 4 would be over rating it. 3, on the other hand, is under rating it. I've gone with three because I prefer to under rate than over rate. So yeah... on to the review...This book started off FANTASTIC. I loved every page. I was totally engrossed in it. Couldn't put it down.I loved how it was written with notes and emails and messanger conversations. It was different and gave a different kind of depth to the characters.We weren't getting to know them through how they spoke, what they looked like, what their habbits were. That was all down to our imaginations. We were getting to know solely WHO THEY WERE. That was a nice change in my opinion. There was no emotional baggage to get caught up on. The characters just... were.I was gearing up for a five star rating and a fabulous review stating how inspiring it was.Then Cecelia Ahern ruined it a bit.It felt like, at around half way through, she began repeating the same old story over again. I could barely bring myself to finish it.It was as though I had finished the book and began reading it again.I found that a huge disappointment.It was torture getting to the final chapter where everything worked out how I wanted it to but I was left feeling unfilfilled.The characters were fifty odd by the time they finally got together. They could have gotten together twenty years or so before then had she not have repeated the whole knocking-up-and-marrying-the-wrong-one plot.It left me feeling frustrated.Half of the book was completely unnecessary. That's all I have to say.I kept hoping something interesting would happen while reading the second half but when I finished it, I realised I'd wasted my time and could have simply skipped to the last few chapters for a more gratifying tale.Maybe that's just me though.Or maybe not.
