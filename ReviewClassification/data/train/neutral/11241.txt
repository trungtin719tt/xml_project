This book was so different from the movie ! ( But then again when are they ever the same ? ) I really enjoyed the story , I now wish the movie had kept a few more things in it. I thought marie was a much better character. I love the way it ended.HOWEVER : There is a TON of swearing ! And I do mean a TON !That was very disapointing . :( but, I now have a fully edited book if someone wants to swap/sell with me. :)I just got a black pin coverd the words. I would have given this story a 5 if it were not for the editing .
