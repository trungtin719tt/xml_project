Why did I avoid this book like the plague? Well, I have a confession: I hate (most) vampire books and I only picked this up because I had the paperback lying around and I was sick of it's unread status mocking me........ but this was a kicka$$ exception. Rose was a perfect heroine and I liked how unapologetic she was and her friendship with Lissa. I'll admit I was rooting more for Lissa and that hot broody jerk (what was his name? I just forgot) than Dimitri-Rose, but I still loved both. Can't wait to read rest of series since I heard it gets better with each book.... that said, not sure when I'll have time. The only reason I picked up this book was because I'm trying to read all my unread paperbacks at home, so I've got some others to get through first...
