My first time to read this book. The reason why I read this book now is that my favorite author, Frank McCourt mentioned in his memoirTeacher Manthat Robert Louis Stevenson was his favorite author when he was a young boy in Ireland. When he moved to New York and during the first year of schooling, he submittedTreasure Islandas his home-reading book and his literature teacher was impressed because his American classmates submitted books of contemporary (now forgotten) authors. After reading this book, I agree with McCourt's teacher. This classic children's book is a readable as the day it first came out in 1883. Truly a proof of Stevenson's excellence in writing.Treasure Islandis really the ultimate "young boy's book".I have not seen the movie or TV adaptations of this book but I now remember, when we were little, hearing my eldest brother singing this song that, according to Wiki, is entitledSea Shanty:"Fifteen men on the dead man's chestYo-ho-ho, and a bottle of rum!Drink and the devil had done for the rest -Yo-ho-ho, and a bottle of run!"Stated in the Wiki entries forRobert Louis Stevenson(1850-1894) that this novel was dismissed by critics to be juvenile and they considered Stevenson as flippant to be taken seriously. However, more than 100 years after its first publication, the book is still being read by people of all ages and from all walks of life. Who knows? Maybe the people who criticizeHarry Potter, The Twilight Saga, The Hunger Gamesor evenThe Song of Ice and Firewill also eat their words 100 years from now.It tells the story ofJim Hawkingswho assists in the running of their inn in England during the 18th century. Their inn is not very busy because it is far from the crowded area so scrupulous (translation: people hiding from something) individuals become their clients. One of these isBilly Boneswho has a secret: he used to be part of the crew ofCaptain Flint, a notorious pirate. One day, Bones is visited by a former fellow crew,Pewwho gives him a treasure map. When Bones opens the map, he saw a "Black Spot" that foretells bad luck and he drops dead of stroke. Jim and his mother opens his chest to get the amount due for Bones's board and lodging but before they could get the money, pirates arrive searching for the treasure map. The rest of the story is about the treasure hunt complete with lots of swashbucking actions (that reminded me very much of the moviePirates of the Caribbean) and the flight to the DeadChest island, an island near the Norman Island located in British Virgin Island.So before Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Deep), there wasLong John Silverand the other pirates ofTreasure Island.The movie series has many similarities with the book so, if you haven't read this and you are a Pirates' fan, you may want to consider reading the book first before seeing the third part of the series,On Stranger Tides. I saw it today and oh it was so good! Of course, still starring Johnny Depp:Oh, I am just desperate to get your votes!
