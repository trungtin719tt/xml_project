This book was sitting on my tbr from last three years gathering dust. I have decided to read at least ten books that are on my shelf for more than two years and this was on top of that pile. One of the other reason is that the author is wrapping up series with the release of final book. I know its foolish to wait for a series to be complete when I even don't know if I am going to like first book or not. But in this case I liked first book and I have decided to go ahead with this series.A really fascinating world where demons rise when the sun sets. People can only survive by locking themselves within magical wards which they drew or carve in earth. This book has three main characters Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer. They're introduced to us as kids and we're told how they became Warder, Herb gathere, and a Jonguler respectively. While their childhood is described beautifully and what inspired them to be a messenger, healer, and a musician, author deprived us of the transition from a teenager to an adult (and of course master of their art).Second thing that bothered me was how easily they accepted each other. It took 85% of the book to meet them and how easily they accepted each other. The realization that they'll be an invincible team struck them in a flash whereas mere days ago they're strangers on road and making decision about their own lives. The romance angle, or whatever it was between Leesha and Arlen, was very odd. In fact there was no love or fidelity, whichever character you look at, it was only lust.It would have been a great book for me had the author explained a little more about Arlen's transition from a mere messenger to an excellent fighter and how he carved those intricate wards(view spoiler)[ on his body specially his back and head(hide spoiler)]. I can ignore Leesha's healing touch and Rojer's soul wrenching fiddling abilities.I will definitely be picking second book as this book has made me very curious about all these demons.
