This is Shakespeare's interpretation of the life and the assassination of Julius Caesar, the incidents that occur following the tragedy, and the plight of the conspirators and assassins.The theme behind the story is universal. Where one wields power, there is always abundant of men who will win his trust and confidence and then shrewdly betray him at the first given opportunity. Greed for power is one of the commonest reasons for treachery from time immemorial. When one is greedy of it, one is too eager to tread on the trust that is bestowed on him and is easily manipulated to conduct him in a dishonest manner. And when greed is coupled with jealousy, the consequences can be quite disastrous. This is beautifully and convincingly portrayed in the play.The play was enjoyable. There was a lot of action and suspense in it. I read the play while simultaneously listening to the audio book. Perhaps, the feel of the scenes and the different voicing of the characters in the audio book contributed to my feeling.There was however a part that I didn't comprehend. Was it the ghost of Caesar that made Cassius and Brutus commit suicide, instead of fleeing? As I understood, they did have the chance to flee.Overall, I'm happy to have enjoyed the play. I watched it as a child long ago and the memory prevented me from reading Shakespearean tragedies for a long time. But I'm happy to have returned to them once more.
