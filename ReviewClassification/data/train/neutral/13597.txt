I enjoyed this book, often times laughing out loud at the quirky humor and the odd way of thinking. Do not read this book for the story because there isn't much of one, but pick it up for the journey and the entertainment of each scene.There's humor around the fact that we as humans are just a spek on a spek on a spek of nothingness. Space and the universe humbles us. And we really don't know much about anything.But maybe the whole meaning of everything really is just "42" and we just don't have the minds capable of understanding it lol.
