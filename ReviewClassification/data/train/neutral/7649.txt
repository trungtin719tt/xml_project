2.5-3 starsMeh. I read this in one sitting and it was okay. The stories were just okay and the commentary felt mostly redundant. I guess it would have been better to read this while reading the 7th book, maybe I would have found it more relatable and entertaining. I'm still glad I finally read this, I have been wanting to for years.
