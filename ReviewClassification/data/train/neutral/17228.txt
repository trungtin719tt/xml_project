Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge #38: A Book With an Ugly CoverNot terribly well written (obviously) but still fairly entertaining. It was definitely interesting to see a book in this series from the perspective of a vampire (RIP Midnight Sun), particularly a newborn vampire, so I'm really glad I finally read this! It's been about 10 years since I discovered the Twilight series so I'm starting to feel really nostalgic and this book was just what I needed.
