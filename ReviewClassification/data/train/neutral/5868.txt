This was the first novel by Neil Gaiman I ever read and I must say that I enjoyed it very much. His writing style is just phenomenal. I LOVE the way he is able to describe the littlest things in such a beautiful way.At around page 50 I was finally really into the book and I absolutely loved the fairy tale aspects of the story.The epilogue was just... wow &lt;3Highly recommend this book if you're into fairy tales!
