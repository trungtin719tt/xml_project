I do like a proper war book, where the soldiers are real men and not action heroes. However, any war story must be measured against "All Quiet On The Western Front" and few can match up.This book starts with a romance in France in 1910, which is a nice idea as it grounds the protagonist before we see him again in the trenches. The romance takes up 100 pages, or a quarter of the book, and was a bit long for me. Then the romance ends and I never understood why, nor did the protagonist.The war stuff is all very real and the author tries very hard to understand war. which is quite difficult since it is such a ridiculous concept. ie: The protagonist is interested to see what will happen, and wonders, as we all do, how so many men can be persuaded to kill each other for so long.By that he means, you might be able to stir young men up with thoughts of conquest or of protecting your own country, but once the initial hysteria is over, how do you keep it going?When all a soldier can see is that himself and his friends are risking their lives and dying horribly every day, what does it take to stop fighting?The answer is that they don't. Each new horror is faced and overcome and people adapt to the hell and keep on fighting.The author isn't referring to individuals refusing to fight, they would simply be shot; but if both armies just stopped, there is nothing the politicians, Kaisers, Kings or Queens could do.The protagonist is an interesting character and his story in the trenches is well worth reading.In summary, it was a bit overlong and repetitive. The jump forward to 1978 was unnecessary and quite dull.
