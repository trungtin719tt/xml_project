So I decided it would be a little fun to put my own spin on this by castingGone Girlin the following way:Amy Poehler as the sociopathic Amy Dunne.Nick Cage as Nick Dunne.And Desi Arnaz as Desi Collings.In the beginning Amy manipulates the reader with her diary entries into thinking:But halfway through the reader discovers:While Nick does wrong by cheating on his wife, Amy decides to stage an elaborate scene to teach him a lesson and turn the public on him--even go so far as to write years of false diary entries and is willing to kill herself to set him up for murder. Apparently,she has a history of drawing people close and then publicly humiliating them with underhanded tactics designed to make her look like the victim. Thisstems from her own boredom and cloying need to have people recognize her greatness. Amy is thatspecial kind of snowflake who isn't nearly as smart as she thinks she is, as therearepeople who see through her bullshit, but since she's amaster manipulator and liarshe is able to fool most rubes without the slightest question because she acts sosweet and above it all.The book and the film deviate in a few ways such as Amy killing Desi with a steak knife instead of a box cutter, a backstory withanotherperson Amy decided to frame as a "stalker", and a distinct lack of Affleck peen (see the spoiler for the shocking pic).(view spoiler)[(hide spoiler)]As for the writing, the voices of both main characters were awfully similar. And Nick doesn't seem to be written like a man thinks. Both go off on tangents and flashbacks in nearly each paragraph to flesh out the past, but it's like too many side stories and they distract from the overall flow. I think, much like Amy, the author is looking for readers to recognize heramazing-ness though it often comes off like being cornered at a party by the person who is so into themselves and must try to sell you on how interesting they are while you nod politely and try to catch a lull in the conversation to extricate yourself. It's long-winded, self-indulgent, and would be more entertaining if it wasn't so busy trying to tell you how smart it is.
