This grimly intense story about boys in a boarding school during the summer of 1942 was painful to read. Not that it was not well-written, it was (which is why it got that third star). And I did get caught up in the storyline, I wanted to find out what happened next. But I could not seem to feel any sympathy for any of thecharacters except Leper.The boys know they will soon face the gruesome realities of WWII, and this knowledge affects each student differently. Besides that threat running through each page, there are layers beneath layers of interactions between the boys themselves, especially the two main characters Phineas and Gene (our narrator).I didn't like Phineas, he was too flighty, manipulative, and egotistical. I tried to like Gene, but he was afraid to face his own truths, afraid to dare to be different and he always allowed himself to follow everywhere that Phineas led him, like a tame sheep. Naturally there would have been no story at all without the chaos caused by these attitudes, but I kept hoping that Gene would face facts at some point and take his life in a whole different direction than the way it turned out.This book was on a class reading list years and years ago in high school, but I chose other titles at that time. I'm glad I finally read it, but I was not as impressed by it as I expected to be.
