I'm having a hard time figuring out how to rate this book.On the one hand I recognize that it is beautifully written. Possibly the most beautifully written prose I've ever read. But beautiful prose isn't really that exciting to me. It kept putting me to sleep and it was taking FOREVER to get through the book. Finally after almost a month when I was at around page 300 I decided to start skipping "the irrelevant stuff." My husband asked how I knew I wasn't missing anything important. I told him I'd already read more than 300 pages so I had a pretty good feel for what I need to read in order to follow the plot.I felt like I had been very patiently waiting for the author to set the stage and give me all of the background and let me get to know the characters. But I was out of patience and I was ready to find out what this book was really about. I wanted to know "what happens."But nothing ever does. Not really. I mean all of the little story lines were interesting. I liked all of the characters and I genuinely cared about what happened to them. But I really missed the big picture. It just wasn't enough for me.And so I can't rate the book very high, because that would be like recommending it, which I don't really. But I can't rate it low because that would be like saying it's not a good book which it obviously is. I just didn't love it.
