I was eating a hotdog right after reading Slaughterhouse-Five, and as I was contemplating on what to write for my review, I was suddenly attacked by a bunch of three-headed toads. They called themselves "the three-headed toads" and they wore Mexican sombreros and Nickelback t-shirts. They were roughly the size of Peter Dinklage and were colored from neon pink to dark orange. For some unknown reason, their leader named Pedro the Pope decided to declare war on hotdog eating humans. I was tragically their first victim. I wet my pants. As the toad named Lollipop Susanna tried to poke me with a rusty Swiss-knife, Pedro the Pope saw in my hand Slaughterhouse-Five. He read it from cover-to-cover in about 37 seconds. Three-headed toads read very fast. Surprisingly, it was the only fast thing they could do. They read lots of books, and somewhere along one of those books, they read that hotdogs caused global-warming. They despised hotdogs. So it goes.After reading Slaughterhouse-Five, Pedro the Pope decided that he didn't like wars anymore. He now despised wars more than hotdogs. He was very easy to convince. Hanky-doodle, the neon pink toad with a disposable spork on his hand, suddenly burst out with random shrieks of "Snakes are noodle-pussies! Snakes are noodle-pussies!" He was not right in the heads. I was mortified. I wet my pants again. So it goes.Pedro the Pope then asked me if whether or not I knew where Tralfamadore was. Three-headed toads did not understand the concept of fiction. I decided to point him in the general direction of my toilet. I said there was a portal there and that all they needed to do was to flush away. After a few moments, I heard some serious flushing. The last thing I heard was "Ribbit!" So it goes.I waited a few moments to make sure that they weren't there anymore. When I came in, I saw something written using lipstick on my toilet:"WaRz R nuT kool!"I wet my pants with a steady stream of urine joy.
