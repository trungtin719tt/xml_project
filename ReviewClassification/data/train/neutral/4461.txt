3.5I'm not sure if this book made me feel like I was stoned or if I needed to be stoned to really appreciate it.It really was pretty hilarious and it was quite a wild ride. The reason I don't rate it higher even though I compliment it as a hilarious, wild ride, is because aside from the entertaining craziness, there didn't seem to be any cohesive story here. Nothing that had a point (although I think that was the point). Just a couple of fucked up guys in Las Vegas believing they were on a quest to find the American dream while under the influence of one of the most radical concoctions of drugs and alcohol imaginable.What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas... including your traumatized maids and grapefruit rinds.
