Re-read it for work-related purposes. And actually, it was much better the second time around. Or maybe Anita Blake's obnoxiousness simply desensitized me. Rachel is still dumb, but at least I like all the other characters, or at least I find them interesting enough to keep me going!08/07/01 This book is lame, there is no other way how to say it. Rachel Morgan, the main heroine, is a little miss know-it-all and at the same time she is embarrassingly stupid. She considers herself a good runner (a sort of special agent or bounty hunter) but she doesn't know that fairies can enter holy ground. She refuses to make any sort of plans but she gets caught twice while breaking and entering and overall, the whole mink fiasco is just painful to read about. She lives with a female vampire whom she accuses of everything from borderline raping her to lying to her but she refuses to move out because, hey, said vampire is protecting her. She uses a man as a human shield when attacked but it's the attackers' fault, they forced her to do it - yes, refusing responsibiliy and yelling "you made me do it" is really mature.The only saving grace in this book is the character of Nick who is intriguing from the moment he appears - unfortunately too late into the plot itself for me to enjoy the book as a whole - and I'm sorry that the author didn't write about him rather than about a whiny heroine that switches from completely incapable to supergirl on regular basis.
