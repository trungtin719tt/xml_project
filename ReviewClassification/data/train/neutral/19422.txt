Melody Brooks is almost eleven years old, has a photographic memory and absolutely loves words. However, she also has very severe cerebral palsy and thus while she has all these words as well as a multitude of advanced ideas and concepts inside of her, she (being non verbal, being unable to speak) cannot get her ideas out and thus many people (including the majority of her teachers) consider her unintelligent and incapable of logical thought. A new type of computer which acts as Melody's voice, which allows Melody to showcase her knowledge, her wants, needs and such changes this personal frustration for the better, but will it be enough, will it silence the naysayers?Now when I first read Sharon M. Draper'sOut of My Mindin 2011, I absolutely and utterly adored it, and during my recent rereading (in order to finally post a review) I still quite (if not actually very much) enjoyed the general storyline (and especially how authentic, emotionally realistic and age appropriate young narrator Melody's voice feels). However, my rereading has also presented to me certain noticeable narrational, textual flaws, nothing major or supremely aggravating in any way, but enough to now considerOut of My Mindno longer with a four star ranking (which I had originally envisioned in 2011) but a high three stars (as while I emotionally have adoredOut of My Mindas much in 2018 as I did in 2011, the logical parts of my brain are indeed also in a bit of an internal uproar, especially with regard to questions and considerations about how accurately and how realistically in particular the more negative characters have been portrayed by Sharon M. Draper).For while I do indeed both know and understand that seriously mean-spirited bullying students such as Claire and Molly do exist, during the course ofOut of My Mindthey sure are portrayed in such a negatively cliched manner so as to more often than not appear more like cardboard and stock folk and fairy tale villains (with for me, the evil stepsisters of Cinderella being a very good and apt comparison). And while I do love folk and fairy tales as a genre, as a type of specific literature type, when I am reading, when I am perusing a patently realistic novel, I do crave, I do want a wee bit more subtlety, and especially Claire and Molly are just so over-the-top mean and vile so as to appear almost ridiculous. Combined with the fact that even with regard to Melody's teachers, there is a rather obvious and occasionally much frustrating tendency for Sharon M. Draper, for the author to divide them sharply and without all that much nuance into either total heroes or total villains, while I have still (and as already mentioned above) indeed very much enjoyed and appreciatedOut of My Mind(and totally do love love love Melody as a character), I can now only consider a high three star ranking (as there could have been so much more done with this novel, had there been less stereotyping, less one-sided either positively or negatively conceptualised characters, and if the ending with Melody's little sister Penny being run over by the family car had been a trifle more integrated and not as tacked on, not as artificial feeling). Still highly recommended, and I for one also do think that the intended audience, that especially girls from about the age of nine to twelve would likely take much potential reading pleasure fromOut of My Mindand would probably not be in any manner as annoyed and as textually, narrationally frustrated with what has been rather bothering older adult reader me (as I do tend to get a bit overly frustrated with and by one and two dimensional character descriptions and scenarios that appear more than a bit out of the blue so to speak).
