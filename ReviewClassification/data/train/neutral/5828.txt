There are 104 pages of review on this book, and I read two pages worth and agreed with a dozen or so. I always wondered why cheap thrillers like this book never get discussed in great literature classes and I think I can answer that question. 1. Because there is no interpretation. Books like this are no brainers. Little thinking is required.That's really it.Now for the book review. First of all, Grisham needed like 1 or 2 more pages to close out. He rushed the ending.Sure it was a great thriller. It posed a great ethical question- Is it ever right to take the justice system in your own hand? Grisham evidently thinks so and the reader most likely will feel sympathy for the "killer"- Carl Lee.This is my third John Grisham book- I agree with the readers who say once you've read one Grisham book, you've read them all. He makes practicing law sound very appealing, like CSI flaunts investagaters. I read the Firm first- absolutely loved it. The Runaway Jury was definately a 2 star rating. This was a thriller, so I gave it a 3.I don't know. The whole book left me feeling really empty and thinking what am I doing wasting my time reading these types of books?
