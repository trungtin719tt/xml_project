A fascinating exploration of the consequences of unquestioned power, though an awful portrayal of women. I appreciated Arthur Miller bringing attention to the Salem Witch Trials and anti-communist hysteria. I hated how he treated Abigail and the other female characters in this story as crazy and antagonizing. Yes, Abigail's actions posed major problems - but Miller portrays John Proctor, the man who has illicit sex with her, as a martyr. Miller grants the men in this play complexity and autonomy; he relegates women to the role of one-dimensional witches. You could blame my feminist side, but you could also blame Miller for failing to seize an opportunity to question the patriarchal standards so salient in Salem.A good, emotional read, with solid writing and a compelling plot. It may make you angry, and if it does, I encourage you to think about who to direct your anger at in this play - the oppressed women, or the men who take advantage of them.
