While reading this book I started to notice how little the Hunchback is in it. A Goodreads friend mentioned that this is why the title for it in France is actually "Our Lady of Paris". For some reason, English translations chose the the Hunchback for the title.If other books, movies, or TV shows named themselves based on a character that was involved as much as Quasimodo was in this story, here is what they would be called:Star Wars = ChewbaccaHarry Potter = Neville LongbottomThe Big Bang Theory = Howard WalowitzThe Shining = Danny TorranceFrozen = OlafLost = Smoke MonsterAll those characters are important to the stories, but they are hardly the main focus. While this is the case with this book, it is not necessarily a bad thing, just a thing to be aware of going in; you really don't get very much Quasimodo.After reading and loving Les Miserables, I had high hopes for this book. But, it was just okay. I am glad I read it and I did enjoy it a lot in a few parts, but most of it was a slog. Hugo spends the first 350 pages or so setting up the story, describing Paris at the time of the story, etc. I think many who try this would have a hard time staying interested. Also, and I hate to say this because I always want my books to be unabridged, but, you could probably abridge this to 150-200 pages and still get everything.Classics buffs, Hugo fans, hardcore historical fiction fans - step right up!
