I don't know if fortunately or unfortunately, but I read the book inShakespearean English. I did understand it, but it was so difficult. I got the plot and stuff. I understood the story, the way it is written. I like the story a lot, the ending even more! In my opinion, it is a bit too long, but I still recommend it. I think it will be better to read it in "normal" English, since I read it like that short time ago and it's much easier to understand it and it can be read in a much more fluent way. I recommend you to read it in normal English, it's easier to chew it. Good play!
