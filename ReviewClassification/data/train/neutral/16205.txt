I don't know why I reread this. I was sitting on the couch and it was within arms length so I picked it up and kind of flew through it in one sitting. I had been thinking to re-read the books I had read from this series and go on and finish it but this really was an unexpected decision heheIt's not a masterpiece, it's not the most unique and breathtaking thing in the universe but bleeding skies, it's so bloody fun. It's a quick read and a bit predictable but honestly it does get better as the series progresses and this is a good introduction!
