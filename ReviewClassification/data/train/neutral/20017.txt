Why do people rate books before reading them? This skews the ratings and I wish people wouldn't do so...This was my most anticipated book of all time. I couldn't wait to read and and naturally was a bit let down. My least favorite of his three.I found the voice in some of the chapters a bit awkward.The characters were interesting and well developed for the most part. I didn't like how the author chose to weave everything together.There were some very well done parts -some moments that were very beautiful. I'm glad I read this but won't anticipate the next book nearly as much although I will definitely read the next one hoping to experience something powerful.
