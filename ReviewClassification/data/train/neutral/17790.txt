3.5/5Whoa,that was quite a ride.Bloodfeverwas without a doubt better thanDarkfever- but only by a half-star. Regardless, it wasn't an "average" read like its predecessor. Therefore, Karen Marie Morning is doing something right &amp; I can't wait to see if book three will get better!When I think of this series, what immediately comes to mind are the words: Guilty pleasure. Because that's what it is, to me. I can't pinpoint one "phenomenal" aspect within these first two books, however, Icantell you that I keep coming back for more. It's pretty addictive.Thankfully, Mac wasn't as annoying in this novel. I mean, she still was (it wouldn't be Mac if she didn't somehow bring up her outfit in the middle of battle), but she wasmuchbetter. She even matured and acted more responsible. Go figure.Ah, of course I need to bring up Barrons. In book one, I didn't care whether or not he ended up with Mac, but in this book, I kept wonderingwhythey weren't together yet. So obviously my subconscious wanted them together, butIwas in denial or unaware of that.(view spoiler)[Regardless, when they kissed (and more) in the cell after he came to rescue her, I was really exited and shocked at everything that had happened before the kiss, too.(hide spoiler)]Overall,this series is still quite confusing. Seriously, each book only addsmorequestions than answers. However, that adds intrigue. So, yeah, smart thinking, Moning.
