Good story more of an "early Koontz" which you can tell from the attitude and the language. Good story though. Do you love dogs...I do and so does Koontz. Especially Golden retrievers. I want to say I liked this book more than the rating may indicate. the story was good and drew me in, I didn't mind the predictability or formulaic parts so much...they exist in a lot of modern "thriller" and "drama" fiction, sort of just "part of it". I "dropped" it from 4 to 3 mostly on Koontz's use of profanity as a sort of crutch. You see it a lot in King's work and also in Koontz'z early work. There seems to an attitude that "everybody among the great unwashed uses this language." To be honest it's more in King than Koontz, as the latter seems to have out grown that particular failing. But in this book we get a lot of it. It could have been so much better with a "better" use of the language.
