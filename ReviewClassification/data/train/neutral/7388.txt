Although I enjoyed it, I think this book could have been much better. The first half is largely a series of character studies, and the second half is essentially a true-life crime novel. Unfortunately I grew dangerously bored with the first half, and as the mystery unfolds, I grew annoyed that many of the characters introduced in the first half really have little play or impact on the rest of the book. The murder mystery itself is an interesting story but is very anticlimactic. While the book is nonfiction, and in that sense rather remarkable that the author experienced these people and events, I perhaps would have liked the author to instead written a much more compelling fictional work inspired by Savannah and the circumstances included in the book.
