This Book was pleasantThings i like:1.Female relationships, very strong i know Taylor wouldn't have made it without them. I love the relationship between Taylor and Turtle. This book is filled with motherly love.2. Struggles- Very realistic (for her time) struggles. The book was truthful and lovable. The struggles were difficult because Taylor was dealing with something that she really wanted to avoid which is having a child. Taylor was always running away from every teenage girls practical fate and it was a surprise to have her put into her life. The way it happened truly shocked me.This was really good for her first book.
