I enjoyed the story... It really drew me in, which is saying something considering that I picked it to read on commercial breaks during the Olympics... and I ended up reading instead of watching.I liked this play because the characters seemed like real, flawed people. Granted, Blanche was a little over-the-top sometimes, but I imagine all southern-belle types are a little over-the-top from time to time.Blanche was an easily identifiable character... someone who deeply regrets a thoughtless act in her youth, and seeks forgetfulness, and another chance at happiness, in all the wrong places. In the end, you are left wondering if everything she said was real, considering that she is a self-proclaimed liar, "unless it is important", but who determines importance?I couldn't really identify with either Stella or Stanley as much... I couldn't really accept how someone could choose their abusive husband over their sister, especially given the accusation at the end.Stanley seemed like a husband jealous of his wife's relationship with her sister and determined to thwart their happiness at every turn... But worse than this, he is also careless with his own supposed best friend's feelings despite the fact that his friend seems very happy.These characters are not like-able, but they are human.
