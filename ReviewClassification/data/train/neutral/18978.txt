So. . .interesting. Written in prose form made it fun to read. The story was a little off. Well, a sad story, but written from an LDS perspective. The author was WAY off on the LDS religion. Sounded more like FLDS to me. A lot of FLDS stuff happening. . .husband beating his wife/daughters, the Bishop/community members turning a blind eye because he's the man of the house and he must be right, husband decides if/when his wife can get a drivers license, girls are expected to marry and procreate, wife's eternal salvation depends on husband to choose her in the afterlife. . .etc. If you're trying to get a peek into the LDS culture, this isn't the book.But the story wasn't too bad. A little bit of a roller coaster ride of emotions. The ending shocked me a little bit, and I wanted to change it, but I guess it made sense.
