This book is wildly pro Zionist and Isreal and was instrumental in convincing a generation of American baby boomers that the jews were heroic pioneers who journeyed from war torn Europe and the the holocaust to Palestine fulfilling their destiny by creating a homeland away from the anti-semiticsm of Europe and making the desert bloom. No wonder that when they made a movie they cast Paul Newman in the lead. It wasn't till much later that we realized that it was not so simple and the equities were not all on one side.
