Strangely, obliquely, likeThe Alchemistbecause this inspires strong emotions - most people will either like it alot and find inspiration and meaning, or loathe it entirely and dismiss it as drivel.Similar in tone and emotion with his novelTuesdays with Morrie. I think that the greatest achievement of this story is the dreamlike, subconscious mood and setting the author creates. He can get a bit syrupy, but not too bad to make this contextually a problem.Albom raises some interesting, thought provoking questions and leaves some unanswered, which makes for a better read, especially considering the subject.As usual, I find myself on neither extreme, neither loving or hating it - finding some worth but also dismissing the buckets of smarmy cotton candy.
