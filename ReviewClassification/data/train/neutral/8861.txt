Overall I as a little disappointed with this collection of poems. It's not that she isn't a good writer, but I think I would have preferred a selection of her poems to a complete collection. I remember I liked her in high school too, so I was kind of bummed out reading (or maybe rereading) this collection. Let's just say you read one poem, you read them all with Dickinson.I do think she is very important for women's writing in America and I do find her life more interesting. Maybe I'd like a biography on her better. The main issue I didn't care for these poems was they got repetitive. This time around, I didn't care for her style as much either. However, she has a voice. I do look for voices when I read, that stand out, compared to other writers. I can say she reminds me of other poets, but she has her own voice. I just wish her voice was a little louder.And what is with Dickinson and bees? Does anyone know?
