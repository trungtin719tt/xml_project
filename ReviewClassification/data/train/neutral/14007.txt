This was really interesting, and the audiobook I listened to was GREAT, but it wasn't my favorite Shakespeare.Maybe I'm just not a fan of some tragedies? In Macbeth, everyone is just the worst, but it's very interesting to read about them even if I don't love it.I want to try reading it again / seeing it, but reading it so spread out and not actually seeing it played out probably hurt my rating.
