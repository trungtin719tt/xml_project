There is ample description of our titular heroine in the first third of "The Girl Who Played with Fire." Lisbeth Salander is composing and arranging a new life for herself while still maintaining the baggage left over from her early years (tons of child abuse) and the occurrences of Book #1. And she's still acting, to put it nicely, quite unconventional. It is precisely this mask, as well as people's prejudices &amp; judgements that make her the ideal infiltrator of conspiracies in the highest echelons of modern Swedish society.All the characters from the first make cameos (well, the ones who survived), &amp; it is because of the magnifying glass on "The Girl (with the Dragon Tattoo)" &amp; the slow introduction of our old pals that makes this a more enjoyable read. The focus of the book changes radically and Mikael Blomkist, the protagonist of Book 1 is more in the background this time. Lisbeth is totally more interesting than Mikael. &amp; yet, I am not quite certain if it is enough.New "thrillers" tend to give you pages and pages you can devour but, really, in perhaps more elegant hands these tales may have touched the Gates of LITERATURE and less trees would have been used. This is a Hollywood flick with symbolism which adds much needed relevance to the genre--&amp; all this is good. Also good--the anti-Macho sentiment and reversal of roles (in this case--the girl with Aperger's is smarter, more agile and even richer than most of the human population) which will be undoubtedly be scrutinized furthermore in the concluding installment. But I am starting to fear that, like a way (wayyyy) more respectable and smarter "Twilight" franchise (popularity-wise), the "Millennial" books may all turn out to be more noise and spectacle than substance.
