Read for The YA Room's Throwback Bingo Challenge!Challenge Square: Urban FantasyI'm so on the fence about whether I want to continue on with the series or not. Something just didn't quite click for me and I have no idea what. The main character Aislinn has an ability to see faeries which according to her only family member (grandmother), they should be avoided at all costs. However, when Aislinn finds she is connected to Keenan and is a 'summer queen', there's no way she can escape. Truth is, Aislinn is in love with Seth, a mortal and doesn't want to lose him. When there was action, the story-line worked really well. The slow pacing and weak connection to the characters spoiled the experience for me. I am really struggling to find a good fae/faerie book!
