Definitely the most powerful book in the trilogy. It is a solid 3.5 rating to me. It can be a difficult read at times because of how graphic the violence is, but that helps show all aspects of the abuse he went through as an child. Mr. Pelzer is a motivational speaker about helping abused children and improving the foster care system getting better. Due to this fact and that he is so emotionally invested in his story, it seems that the story is weighed down at times by him needing to include so many opinions and memories. I liked the moments when we were inside his head and clearly able to see what he was seeing, but moments like this were not there throughout the book. It seemed like he picked and chose whether we focused on his feelings or his surroundings mostly and this bothered me since the book is suppose to be a mixture of the two.
