i don't know who i am trying to kid. i keep reading these survival stories, thinking to myself, "i will know what to do if this happens - i will have tips and tricks and i will be the last one standing." that's pretty much bullshit. while its true i probably could survive, i wouldn't want to. i'm a fat lazy american - i don't want to have to scavenge. i don't want to have to hunt and skin deer or build a shelter or defend myself from others looking to eat my delicious arms. i don't want to have to dig for water or develop a complex food-storage system or eat dandelion greens. and the first warm day, that would be it for me. i cannot live without air conditioning. or showering. and i am a baby now when i have to deal with (shudder) menses. post-apocalyptic menses without a duane reade around? that would be the death of me. i am no survivor. but i like to read about other people surviving and telling myself it would be different if it were me. but i know that it's a lie. oh but the book... it's a fine teen novel of a family struggling to survive after an asteroid knocks the moon a little closer to the earth and the resulting tsunamis and volcanoes and weather malfunctions. but mostly the starving. dear god, the starving...come to my blog!
