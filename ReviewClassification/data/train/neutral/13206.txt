This is undoubtedly a good murder-mystery story with a complex plot. And here Poirot's brilliant analytical mind comprehends the mystery without positive proof and apprehend the criminals who would have easily escaped punishment. But Poirot's verdict is his own which always shows his consideration for human feelings.There is quality in the story (although thematically repetitive). And there are many twists and turns which keep the reader guessing as to who committed the crime and how. However, even with all the plus points, I couldn't enjoy it as much as I enjoyed some of the other works in the Poirot series. Perhaps it was due to the how the story was executed or perhaps it was my reading it during my travels, but quite honestly, I was actually bored at times. It was a very surprising experience. I suppose it was because the inadequacy of the suspense element which Christie has abundantly used in some of her other novels. The beginning was promising, but as the story progressed I couldn't engage with it with the same enthusiasm. The ending turned well enough and I should say it even surprised me, but the some of the middle chapters were a real chore.Overall, it was of course a good effort by the Queen of Crimes. But for me, this is not one of her best.
