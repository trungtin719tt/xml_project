Hmm......It would appear that poor old Berlioz was not the only one to lose his head, feels like mine has gone as well!, not literally though more mentally, as I can't quite make heads or tails out of what has just gone before my eyes!. While other writers of this time period put pen to paper in the darkest of ways under Stalin's reign, Mikhail Bulgakov decides to write about among other things, talking cats, naked witches, Pontius Pilate, invisible body cream, trumpet playing gorillas and dancing polar bears!, the range of characters on offer are also nothing short of fantastically bonkers!, the sheer audacity to come up with the ideas for this novel has to be commended, and the fact of being written in secrecy obviously helped. The devil be told, I am still unable contemplate whether this is a work of utter genius or the ramblings of a complete nutcase!. At times it felt all over the place, throwing to much madness at you all at once, but it somehow manages to get away with, though I still don't know why. Two things I do know for sure, Bulgakov certainly had one hell of an imagination and this will have to be read again, not necessarily to try and make more sense of it all but just for the sheer experience of being taken on a devilishly wild ride around Moscow and beyond.
