I will start by saying that Zoey's love-life resembles the mythological Hydra. Kill one boyfriend, and two more will grow back in his place.This was probably the slowest-paced of all the books. The first 100 or so pages were all Zoey feeling like Erik was being 'possessive' even though they had just gotten back together and she was sending him mixed signals, by also wanting to spend alone time with Heath. Erik did not take this lightly, however."I didn't yell. I didn't scream and smack him like I really wanted to. Instead, all i did was shake my head and say in my coldest voice, "Erik, enough. Just because we're back together doesn't mean you can tell me what to do.""How about does it mean you don't cheat on me again with your human boyfriend?" Erik snapped.I gasped and took a step back from him like he'd slapped me. "Why the hell do you think you can talk to me like that?"That wasn't even bad compared to what you did to him?Also, I deducted one whole star for the character Kramisha. If this book was written in 2018 the authors would have probably described her as "ratchet" and had her eating flaming hot Cheetos and listening to Cardi B. It was terrible. She can't speak proper English and is named the Poet Laureate for her intuitive poems."Y'all go on now. I got work to do. Then I gotta get my rest. A Poet Laureate do have to look her best," Kramisha said primly, finishing up with a couplet.Okay.That being said, I didn't dislike this book. I'm curious to see what happens with Stark, Neferet, Aphrodite and Darius.I actually don't give a rat's ass about Kalona.
