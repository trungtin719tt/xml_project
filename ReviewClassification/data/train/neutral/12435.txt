I thinkUnder the Domeis my second Stephen King book, but don't quote me on that. Now I've seen a couple of episodes about the show,Under the Domeand I was hoping that this book would be better than that.Under the Domehad an interesting concept but I was kind of getting bored with the book. It might have had to deal with how long the actual book was but I can't say that it was the only flaw. Now in this book you met a ton of characters. However, I feel like the overall pace of the book was kind of slow. I believe the tv show had a lot faster pace of everything happening.. but I honestly don't remember much about the show. With the ton of characters throughout the book it was quite easy to get overwhelmed and lose track of who is who. Trust me, I had some confusing moments and had to back track a lot.Overall, the story was long but it was interesting and entertaining enough to keep me chugging along. I developed a ton of questions while reading and I'm pretty sure I got them all answered?? But if I'm being honest I didn't keep track of everything. At one point I just kind of went along with everything and wanted to see how it all played out. I never finished the show so I didn't see the ending coming the way that it did.I will definitely try to read another Stephen King book.. but maybe a shorter one?!?
