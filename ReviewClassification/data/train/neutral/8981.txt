The writing of the trilogy vastly improves as you go along, but if you can ignore the flat writing then you can easily get swept up in the almost soap opera-like affect of the interwoven stories of the Shadowhunters and Downworlders.Fun, romantic, with evil at every turn you can easily understand why Clare's world has gained a promo ate space in many a fangirl's fantasy. Personally, I preferred the prequel trilogy (The Infernal Devices), but it was entertaining to see how the two periods connected. My main problem is the Clary is often oblivious to what is happening around her, though I feel this is because she is supposed to act as if she were the reader who is new to the world of Shadowhunters, but strangely she sometimes forgets her role. This makes Clary come off as a naive and ignorant protagonist. The other characters, however, and almost always true to the character they were originally set out as....which makes Clary all the more frustrating at times. That said, Clare seems to mostly fix that problem by the end of the second book, when her writing really started to take its own form. And despite all these problems I enjoyed them far more than I should.
