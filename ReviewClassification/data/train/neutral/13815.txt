COUNT AS TWO BOOKS! Tally has been transformed into a strong, mean person like the specials she saw when she was an ugly and pretty.Everything is perfect, Shay and Tally are friends, the privileges of being a special type of special (a cutter), and she can have any crazy surgery she wants.When she helps Special Circumstances bring the Smoke down, her life as a pretty and ugly clash with her current life, making her decide if she should follow orders or fight for the places and people that bring back all her memories.I have to admit when I was first starting to read Specials I was dreading it!It's not a significant piece of writing from this series, following the same old plot as Uglies and Pretties.The characters from the other books seem unchanged and into their old bad habits while the writing tends to get repetitive like a skipping cd.First it begins with a party at which something life changing takes place that leads to lots of drama that then has a big finally.It would be more worthwhile watching grass grow than reading this book.You may think that from my criticism of this book that I wouldn't suggest the reading of the last book (Extras), but I am.It is much more intense than some of the other books.In the book Tally becomes famous for her rebellious acts throughout the world even technological Japan (where Aya Fuse lives).When Aya finds a machine with potential to destroy an entire country ,she doesn't stay quiet about it, making the group behind it track her down.The new Japanese characters' interaction with the Americans from the previous books is hillarious.So if you felt unsatisfied with Specials you should know that reading extras is a pleasurable experience.
