Sometimes I find it impossible to choose the next book I want to read. So whenever I have a case of analysis paralysis while staring at my bookshelf, I ask my husband Kacy to pick me a book. Sometimes this works out wonderfully, but most of the time he grabs a longtime resident of our bookshelf that's been left untouched and I force myself to read it. Sadly readingSnow Crashwas a case of the latter, just like withAmericanah.This was really disappointing for me! I really wanted to like it after so many of my Goodreads friends have loved it, but I just didn't. It felt really choppy and unfocused to me, and all of the history stuff could have been condensed into a single chapter-- just completely tedious infodumping. It felt very "I am Very Smart" and just ugh.I somehow still want to read more Neal Stephenson, mostly out of a feeling of obligation. Anyone have recs for a book by him that is the opposite of this one? Thanks.
