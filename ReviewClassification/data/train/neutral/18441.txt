There's something discombobulating about reading a book set in the future that was written 23 years ago - because some of the future "technology" described does in fact already exist (books on 'disc' for example). There was also some interesting conversations about guns and gun violence in this book, which is very applicable right now with all the gun violence legislation being discussed in Florida and nationally right now. So all that together kind of kept me from being immersed in the book fully if I am being honest.But ignoring that, I did like this book but I just didn't love it. The L-bomb gets dropped way too soon, the main detective almost solves nothing herself really, and the villain is pretty darn obvious all along. BUT....I like the setup of the world and the romantic relationship and the insight into her past, so I'm interested enough to continue to read on. I mean, the books in this series probably get better considering there areFORTY-SIXbooks already published in this series. Crazy!!1 down, 45 to go...
