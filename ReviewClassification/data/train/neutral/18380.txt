2016 reading challenge - a book with a blue coverI expected something else when I initially picked this book up. But one thing I love about the books is when they surprise me. And this one surprised me in a good way. I liked the decision Leslie made in the end. Her character was the most likable and I appreciate the girl-power message the author was trying to get across. Or at least that's the message I got from reading this novel.
