This book did not work well to me,Cornelia Funkegave me another headache after reading herInkheartseries which I thought will be one of my favorites since the movie was great. I did like the movie very much and I dug a hole 6 feet under for the whole series not be seen by my eyes again. Well, I think I broke one of the important rules of reading and watching book-tie-in stuff. I did watch the movie before the book so that made things worst but I was hoping not.The last time I remember readingCornelia Funkewas when my mom go shopping in the nearby mall for 4 hours and I wait like a lap dog. Seriously, I'm very disappointed toFunkebut I'm not yet done with her and I might try her other YA or children's books which will be niceraw(by reading reviews out of control).WhenProsperandBoescaped from their cruel rich aunt they met this group of kids who helped and cared by theThief Lord, which fed them and act like a grown man. Well, he was hoping to be a grown man unfortunately something horrible scene happened in the end. They metBarbarossa, the antique dealer, and they are asked to met with theContewho only wish is to find a missing piece of one of his antique toys (quite big for a toy though) and so on.Talking about the characters which one of them have their own different personalities and very interesting thatFunkemade 6 characters very well and very hard to familiarize each in the beginning of the story.ProsperandBo, orphaned and living with their cruel aunt, and they escaped and found home in an old theater.Musca, the black boy who have love to water.Hornet, the reader and the only female in the band. She's quite a mother.Riccio,sometimes called the weasle because of his,eeew, his ugly teeth! Lastly,Scipio, the Thief Lord and the one who acts as an adult in the pack (Alpha Dog). If I have the chance to become one of them, I might choseProsper. He is a nice brother, caring but to possessive but I think he only protect his brother from their cruel relatives and of course safety. But I think my hopes will die along because they already made a movie!I did expect a lot to this book since most of my friends really liked this book and theInkheartseries which I should not done before I started reading this book. This story is very unique, quite magical although there are not much of magical stuff inside and no popular book characters appeared. At leastCornelia Funkeemphasize the city of Venice, how ancient, dark and historical the place is.So far this is my 3rd book about Venice and I want more, hoping to go there soon, later in life. Jeez, don't think that I have to be 60 before I start traveling outside Philippines. The dark and childish aroma of this book is very fascinating for a young child, but not for me. Although I read a lot of children's books, this one is different, this one is more on adventure and deception. Kind of.I recommend this book to those who love to read children's books and child at heart. Don't forget, this book was one ofCornelia Funke's best book and guys you have to read this. But until now, I'm still been sued by many conspiracy behind this book. This is not as good as any book I read but not bad enough to be like and enjoyed in a series of minutes. Enjoy reading and see you to Venice in no time!The cast of the movie and Cornelia Funke. I don't have any idea where they took this photo but I can still remember the pigeon that mentioned in the story. The one that flew up high.Review posted onOld-Fashioned Reader.Rating:The Thief Lordby Cornelia Funke,3 SweetsChallenges:Book #203 for 2011Book #119 forOff the Shelf!
