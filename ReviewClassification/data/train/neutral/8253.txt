goodreads david writes this:I'm convinced that the general besmirchers of Steinbeck are fucktards, asswads, and vibrating pustules.it's nice as a reader (bad, i guess, as a reviewer) when a writer achieves can-do-no-wrong status. reading steinbeck i feel less distance between the writer -&gt; his words -&gt; myself than with nearly any other writer. his prose stylings can't touch his contemporaries, his structure and pacing can be sloppy, he's sentimental, preachy, overly didactic, and his themes arrive with the subtlety of a sledgehammer to the kneecaps.but who gives a shit? i'm not grading a paper. he gets an A+ and a gold star at the top of his paper forcannery row, possibly the most complete and interesting fictional world i've encountered;travels with charley, my all-time favorite travelogue; andgrapes of wrath, a flawed but incredibly moving masterpiece.andthe pearl... a clumsy and sweet fable, overwrought and obvious -- definitely a lesser work. but it's steinbeck writing and he's filled with such love for mankind, wonder at nature, and joy at the strange eccentric and eclectic that, even if upon reading the remainder of his writings i find the literary equivalent of sex with goodreads david... steinbeck remains untouchable.
