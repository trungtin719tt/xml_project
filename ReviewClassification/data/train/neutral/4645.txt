3.5. I had not read this as a child so it was all new to me. I really enjoyed this story. It's very fascinating that this woman lived alone on an island for 18 years. Obviously the author knew nothing of her daily living but he did a wonderful job creating her life. Living with all of the luxuries available to us today makes it so clear to me how "easy" my life is. I would not probably not survive a year let alone 18.
