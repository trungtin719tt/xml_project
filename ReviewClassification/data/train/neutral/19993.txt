I'm giving it three stars because of Tom Robbins' ability to make fantastical and creative (although sometimes rather esoteric) metaphors.I'm not sure if my biggest problem with the rest of the book is that he's actually an ass about women while thinking he's a feminist OR if it's that the book is such a self-indulgent vehicle for him to spout all of his own philosophies through the "opinions" of his characters. He wrote this book about points he wants to make about life and the universe, not really a story with challenges for characters.Some of those observations are interesting...but it was laborious to read his 416 page philosophy essay that was disguised as "creativity" by overdoing his similes and relying on sex as art.Plus, is he implying in his last chapter that lesbian relationships don't work because women aren't whole without a man...? I think he might be...I really wanted to give it 2.5 stars, but that wasn't an option.
