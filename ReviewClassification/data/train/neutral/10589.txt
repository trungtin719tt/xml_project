I should probably have started with the first book in this series. However, I'm familiar with the story.Anne is now 16 and about to take up a post as school teacher at the school where she was a former pupil. Life continues at Green Gables and somehow the comings and goings and small details of everyday country life make for easy if not especially interesting reading. Anne's character and ability to drift into a dream-world at the flick of a switch continue to amuse. As does Marilla's dry humour.This series reminds of a simpler time where endings are always happy and life content. It is good for a bit of escapism but I prefer something a little more dramatic. The first book in the series is definitely the best.
