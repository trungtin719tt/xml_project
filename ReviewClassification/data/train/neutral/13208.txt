What I liked best about this one was the kindness and insight of Poirot, I think. You don't often see that emphasized in detective stories. It's what I've liked best about him in some of the other stories, too. I don't love interpretations of him that focus on only his foppishness and fastidiousness without balancing it out with the wisdom the character is capable of. When done right, it's a great study in how people have multiple dimensions, and multiple worthwhile dimensions, and dismissing the whole human in a 200 character joke is an insufficient way to engage with humanity.
