Actually, I give this sort of a three b/c the author's style was oddly skillful, as a story though, it left a bitter taste in my mouth. Parts of the books were intriguing, other parts disturbing -- but given the subject matter I see no way around that; and yet, I can't quite get past it either.Frankly I'm just really conflicted. The writing style was definitely interesting. Choppy, metaphoric, sensational; the author was very effective in putting me inside the characters' heads. I admire her ability, but sometimes I wanted out b/c it was such a dreadful place to be.The father was a dispicable man, and there is no getting around that. The forgiveness between him and Frances at the end was somewhat redeeming -- sort of. The way Frances sent Lilly out into the world was weird. And the ending was unsatisfying regarding every character, except for Frances's son.Hmm...I think I'll be puzzling over this one for awhile, and maybe that was the author's goal. If so, then I give her 5 stars. I guess the best way to describe this book is mostly interesting, and extremely unsettling. Read at your own risk.
