Why is this series so addictive. WHY?? America is so much more obnoxious, indecisive, and all around THE WORST in this book which makes it a 3 star, but the rest was pretty great.I pretty much LOATHE the show The Bachelor, and this book felt a lot more like that than the first book, so that was not super great. If you like that kind of thing, THERES A LOT OF JEALOUSY TO GO AROUND SO HAVE FUN!However, the overall story and worldbuilding is still pretty great, and I'm sure there will be something big happening with the rebels in the next book. THINGS BESIDES THE SELECTION YAY!!!America and Maxon have their moments where I really like them, but most of the time I hate them, but I love to hate them? I don't understand it. There's just something about these books that gets me worked up enough to yell at the characters and *literally* face palm at their stupidity. If any book gets me that passionate it's worth the reading experience!For a sequel, this wasn't the best, and definitely wasn't as good as The Selection, but still an interesting piece to the story. Looking forward to AMERICA ACTUALLY MAKING A FREAKING DECISION in the next book.
