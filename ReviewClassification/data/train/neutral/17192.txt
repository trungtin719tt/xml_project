I expect way more from Patterson. This whole book was mainly Fang and Max making eyes at each other. It drove me nuts. Nothing major happened. We found Max's mom, which didn't make much sense, again, i expect more. Fang was getting "jealous" of Ari, which um, he's her brother so stop. Boring really. This book really focused too much on Max, not enough on the flock as a whole.Misc.Book Boyfriend:No.Best Friend Material:Angel.
