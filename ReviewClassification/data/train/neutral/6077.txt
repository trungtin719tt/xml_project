I chose to read this book with what it was trying to get across and not literally. It is a weird book to take literally, which could be weird for a child reading it that takes things literally. It might scare the crap out of them. If you take the story as how irritating children are and you love them anyway, no matter what, then it is a great book.It is weird to see the mother sneak into the kids room at age 9 and rock him, and I think it is supposed to be about the love you have for them.I didn't think the art was all that great either. I did read this to the kids and it didn't seem to bother them too much. It didn't scare them and it didn't really affect them either. I think it's actually more a book for parents.
