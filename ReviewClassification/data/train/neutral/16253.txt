BLOOD OF OLYMPUS REVIEW: Contains Spoilers!(Last edited July 25th, 2015)Wow... it's over...I've been following the Percy Jackson series for about four and a half years. In fact this series is one of the reasons I really started reading in the first place. It's a pretty long story that involves way more time than I have space to write, but the general idea is that this series means a lot to me and it has for some time.So, reading The Blood of Olympus my standards of quality were through the roof. And though my expectations weren't crushed, they weren't met either.And since I have a lot of complaints, I'll start with the good things.The second I learned that this book was including a Nico and Reyna point of view I thought it was doomed. So I was happily surprised by how much I enjoyed their parts. Nico and Reyna formed an unlikely friendship and I found their banter really sweet and unique. These two were able to bond in such strange ways and it was fun to see the growth of their friendship.If I was to pick a favorite of the two, it would be Reyna. As much as I liked Nico and enjoyed seeing the extent of his power, I felt that I learned far more about Reyna and how she changed as a person. One of my favorite parts of the book took place on the boat with the pegisi and Orion. Reyna's moment of selflessness was really empowering and it felt like an important moment of self discovery for her. It was one of the few scenes that reminded me of the previous books.Piper was another great character and it makes me sad that people think she needs to prove herself when she has a thousand times over. Her instincts and fighting skills are incredible. Piper was a key character to keeping the crew relaxed and optimistic. It bothers me that people think she isn't allowed to be kind and strong at the same time.As for the ending with Leo, I'm conflicted. I do like their romance, but it felt abrupt to me. The entire book seemed a bit week and unfinished. Overall the book was enjoyable enough, but it didn't feel like a proper conclusion. I think Riordan could have really benefited from a longer deadline.On the negative side, I think Riordan set up more than he could handle. I know writing for seven main characters (or nine including Reyna and Nico) is not an easy task. Which is why in most of the books only some characters had a main focus, but that doesn't leave the reader feeling any less disconnected from the characters who aren't in the spotlight. I really missed Frank and Hazel and found the focus of Jason, Piper, and Leo a bit... unnecessary. Though I understand that it is essentiallytheirstory I don't understand the point of alienating the other characters to the extent he did.I felt that some characters acted differently when written through another characters eyes. Certain dialogue felt more like the character narrating than the one speaking and it was frustrating. None of the characters felt as unique as they had in the past. To me a lot of their personalities seemed to blend together in this last book.Though I did like Jason in this book, it seemed as if Riordan was trying really hard to prove his worth to the audience. I like Jason. I don't like him as much as I like the other characters, but Idolike him. However, the fact that his legacy was "him carrying on what Percy failed to finish" felt really... last minute... I understand all gods should be recognized, but it felt like something all seven of them should have realized on their quest. NotjustJason. I just feel like Jason's journey to self confidence was really weak and lacking.Also by making the goddess of storms more powerful doesn't that put both mortals and demigods at risk of dangerous shipwrecks?I think Riordan must have abandoned some of his original plots for the series due to the lack of time. Though we do know what happens to all of the important characters, there isn't that feeling of closure. This is something really important that original series had and this one didn't. This book was lacking the feeling of togetherness that books 1 - 3 had. The first three books were well written, well edited, and they flowed perfectly. Book five was sort of a, "Crap the series is ending and I only have a year I guess I'll just throw it together," novel. You can tell Riordan worked really hard on this conclusion, but I don't think it was shown the camecareandthoughtthat the other books were.The build-up really led to almost nothing. Percy's fatal flaw played such a minor role, Frank's lifeline plot was abandoned almost entirely, and the way to kill Gaea was to just fly her into the sky? It was too simple. I was also very bothered by the personalities of the gods in this book. Everyone seemed to fit their cookie cutter image more than their 3-dimensional personalities Riordan had brought me to appreciate and love.Back to the point of there being nine demigods rather than seven: I can't help but feel this wasn't how Riordan originally planned the story. It's a five book series, of course his ideas were going to change over time, but the prophecy was barely even a guideline by the end, and I have to say that really does bother me. In my opinion the real turning point for the series was the fall into Tartarus.The way book 3 ended was spectacular and I absolutely loved it. The Mark of Athena is probably the best book in the series, if not one of the best books he has ever written. But a lot of times when an author creates such an emotional and shocking ending, they trap themselves in a corner. I've encountered this multiple times in my reading travels and almost every time the author has dug a hole they can't get themselves out of. Some examples of these types of endings, in my opinion, would be books likeDeliriumandInsurgent. On their own they're incredible, but they make it really difficult to continue with the series.OverallThe Blood of Olympuswas a real let down for me and the more I'm away from it the more I'm disappointed. I can't say that I'm shocked since I was already seeing a change in his writing inThe House of Hades,but it makes me sad that such an amazing series had such an unsatisfactory ending. It was generally boring and felt pointless at times. It lacked the creativity that I've always loved about his writing and I find the quality of the book to be really inexcusable, especially as a conclusion.Also note that even though this review is mostly negative, I mean no disrespect to the author or to any readers who enjoyed it! I was just personally very disappointed and thought I would share my thoughts. I originally wrote this review when I completed the book after it's release, but have since edited it as my thoughts changed. Thanks for reading!
