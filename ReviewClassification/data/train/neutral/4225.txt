And with just 6 hours to spare - the 2017 Pop Sugar Reading Challenge has been completedThe prompt:A book you bought on a trip.A whimsical classic tale featuring Mole, Rat, Badger and Toad. We have sheltered Mole, venturing out to see the river with Rat. There's the stodgy old Badger who turns out to be much more warmhearted than anticipated. The fanciful Toad learns several valuable life lessons - one of which requires the garb of a grandmother during a prison escape!Charming, fun and a bit concerning. Look, reading this as an adult, I do have a few questions:--Do all critters have the same name?If two moles meet, do they refer to each other as Mole? Or is it just our cast of characters that has the misfortune of being named after their species?--How can they eat meat?It seems like all animals are intelligent beings in this book so how can they bear to eat ham and sausages?Perhaps the tasty animals don't count...Blog|Instagram|Twitter
