This book grabbed me and wouldn't let me go ... at first. I had a hard time putting it down and doing required things to love, like eating and sleeping. But near the end of the book, it began to lose me. Let me elaborate.The book begins with a murder trial 10 years after World War II. On a tiny island in the United Sattes called San Piedro Sound, murder hasn't been as issue in many years. But a fisherman is dead, and foul play seems to be involved.The suspest is a Japanese American who lost land when Pearl Harbor was attacked and all the Japanese Americans were taken away from the island for awhile. The dead fisherman's mother did not sell him the land he had been promised after WWII, and the town believes he is still resentful for this. Also at the heart of the matter is the fact that even though Pearl Harbor and World War II ended a decade ago, the tension is still there on this tiny island.The other main part that we learn about is the wife of the murder suspect, who in her youth was in love with a white boy on the island. She knew her Japanese American family would never accept her marrying a white boy and so she married a JA man. Her love went to war and fought the Japanese-as he said, "I killed people that look like you."All of this was beautifully written and spellbinding. However, I was disappointed with the way the relationship between the two young lovers played out, and the end of the book suddenly turned into a detective novel instead of a story about forgiveness, love, and forgetting the past. And although the two main stories were tied together in the end, I don't think they were tied together in a way that worked for me.I want to see the movie and see if it leaves me feeling more complete ...
