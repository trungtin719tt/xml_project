Entertaining little story. I know I am not the intended audience at this point in my life, but it takes me back to when I was a kid and read Charlie and the Chocolate Factory, Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator, and Danny Champion of the World. I used to really enjoy Dahl's books and it has been a long time since I have read one.This one was less story and more silly wordplay and fantasy. Towards the end it gets into a storyline, but at least the first half is mainly just a conversation between the BFG and Sophie. It is fun, but gets a bit repetitive.Also, I noticed that there was quite a lot of violence and racial stereotyping that would probably be controversial in a children's book by today's standards. This is just an observation, not me being the book police!All that aside - it was silly, it was fun, it was a romp through the imagination. I definitely enjoyed this little fantastical getaway, even if it isn't my favorite Dahl book.
