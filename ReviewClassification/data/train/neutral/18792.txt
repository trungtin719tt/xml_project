While I liked this book alright, it's kind of a period piece. Similar to books that seemed "visonary" or "revolutionary" for their time, THE WINTER OF OUR DISCONTENT did not "wow" me with anything. THE CATCHER IN THE RYE, A SEPARATE PEACE, REVOLUTIONARY ROAD (written later), are books dealing with domestic American angst and families during the 50'/60's. Many of these books are rather unimpressive to me, even though they may be considered classics to critics. Again, I'm glad I read this offering from Steinbeck, but I would never revisit it.
