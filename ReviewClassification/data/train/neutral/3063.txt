I live in the town where this book was written, and in the movie they filmed a scene in the old hardware store that the boy's grandfather owned. Now it is a restaurant named Jincy's Kitchen. Great food. It is decorated as the movie crew left it. Those things are kind of neat, and it is even nice that we have a Red Fern Festival.What isn't so nice is that during this festival they have coon hounds chasing a coon skin to a tree, and then the dogs get to that tree and bark up a mighty storm, for in that tree they have a raccoon in a cage. Next they set the cage on the ground and let the dogs fight over it, scaring the poor raccoon. No telling what happens when they let the raccoon out later on when they get it home. I would love to lead a revolt against this practice, but it would do no good. I just don't go to that part of the festival. We went once, and once was enough. I also remember that my step-dad took us kids to watch the coon trials somewhere in California, Coalinga, I think. It didn't bother me then.Now for the book. The first part of the story was sweet as the boy in this story walks from Sparrow Hawk Mountain to the mercantile store in Keys, OK in order to pick up two coon hound pups that he had purchased. He had to spend the night in the woods each way, so that was an adventure. He cared for them and loved them, but neither I nor the raccoons cared for him or even for his dogs.This was a book club read, so I complained about it, and one of the women said that they hunted coons because they were hungry. Well, yes, why else would you want to hunt a raccoon? I can think of other reasons: the pelt and the sport. And yes, I understand needing warm clothing and food, but it didn't make me want to finish the book, and so I didn't. As for me, I will throw my copy of the book into a tree, and the dogs can bark it down for any kid who wishes to read it.
