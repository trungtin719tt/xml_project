Re-Read in 2017:3 StarsI read this book for the first time back in 2015 and loved it but than I never continued the series for some reason. Renewed determination to attempt this series again I decided to refresh my knowledge of the characters and story by giving it the old re-read.I forgot how much I enjoyed these characters especially the two side characters Ivy and Jenkins. Ivy is my literary girl crush. She's a vampire with asian features I imagine Gemma Chan as this character:She's is cold, collective, organized, powerful, scary, and mysterious. AND has a girl crush on our lead character Rachel Morgan? I don't know if this is true or not. I'll have to see as the series progresses but I'm definitely getting sexual tension between the two. Which I missed during my first read but I would love this relationship to become true, but in my mind I feel as if Nick and/or (the villain) Trent are the two boys Rachel will eventually be with. Which isn't nearly as original since the falling for the cold blooded killer that is misunderstood is very trope-y and fucking weird. Why do authors always give us these stockholm syndrome romances like murder-y boys are so badass? PASS!!I forgot how interesting and complex the world building is in this novel. The re-writing of history where the funding used for NASA was re-routed to bio-engineering causing a super virus that wiped out half of humanity except a certain part that is immune; leading to the reveal that human's have been living side by side with Vampires, Pixies, Witches, Elves, Trolls and so on. This huge historical event is called The Turn. As human's have proven to do time and time and time again instead of embracing the new subcultures they separate with extreme prejudice. Giving these magical beings their own neighborhoods in the same vain as Little Italy and ChinaTown just with out any of the tourists since these neighborhoods scare the shit out of humans. The one our story takes place is The Hollows a magical community within Cincinnati. I found the world building easy to follow and engrossing. I loved learning about the dos and don'ts of the new world in this book just as much as the characters relationships.The things I didn't like in this novel that gave this book the down grade rating of 3 Stars instead of 4.5 Stars this read. Is that I found the main plot to be absolutely dull. Other than the assassination attempts, the actual let's try to bring down the baddie Trent (who deals in illegal Brimstone) to be beyond boring. I didn't care for Trent, I hated every chapter that involved Rachel becoming a Minx and chatting about her new found Minx life, and I hate how easily she kept(view spoiler)[getting caught by him literally every time!!(hide spoiler)]Get it together girl.Despite the crap major plot I am interested in continuing this series, the world building and characters are just too wonderful, and hopefully given a plot line that doesn't suck this series can be my new addiction. Read this book if you love Urban Fantasy with a kick-ass cast of characters except Trent. I hate Trent, if that bothers you. You can go Turn yourself : P4.5 StarsLOVE! LOVE! LOVE!I went into to this with zero expectations. I have never read a urban fantasy novel before so I had no idea what I was getting myself into. This novel was brilliant. The Hollows is basically like considered the shady part of whatever town you live in, except this shady town is where all the magical creatures live in kind of like how in multicultural cities like Toronto, you get random cultural communities like Little Italy popping up. The Hollows is like the magical community but cause human are little prejudice towards magical beings its kind of avoided by most of them except for the poor who need cheap housing or the bold who want to see these magical people. The world building is on point. The entire novel takes place in an alternative timeline in which government funding for putting a man on the moon actually went into bio-engineering that created a genetically engineered Tomato that contained a deadly virus that wiped out one third of the population in the 1960s. This event brought to light the magical community that was living in hiding and were in fact immune to this virus. This event is referred to as the Turn.40 years later we are introduced to Rachel a 25 year old witch. Who is just goals for awesome female characters she is smart, resourceful, sarcastic, and independent. She decides to leave her former job as a bounty hunter/runner to open her own firm. The only problem is she takes her old bosses favourite runner with her; an emotionless and cold Vampire named Ivy. So, her boss puts a bounty on her head. So not only is she trying to open her own firm but now she has to deal with magical creatures hired to kill her for pay.The story line is crazy. There is so much action, and adventure you are pulled in from chapter one. The secondary characters are perfect. Usually they aren't fleshed out nearly as much as the lead but Ivy and Jenkins are brilliant. Jenkins is a sassy fairy that adds humour to the novel and Ivy is just everyones girl crush. She is a vampire that has sworn off blood and has to deal with cravings especially the one she feels towards Rachel. At one point in the novel she gives Rachel a How to Date a Vampire novel as guideline to know how not to act around her so she doesn't tear out her throat and drink her blood. How amazing is that!?!All and all I loved this book. If this urban Fantasy I think I found my genre! The only problem I had is that for one Rachel's missions to take down one The Hollows worst baddies she turns herself into a minks I believe? Or some sort rodent type mouse creature so she break into an office and grab information and then it's like her as rodent for 4 chapters I appreciate the point it had for the story but I was like ok, now back to witch, ok now back to witch, ok how bout now! And so on. So, that is literally my one complaint! The novel was amazing and it's a series of 12 so I'm so excited that I can read about these characters for such a long time! AMAZING! Highly Recommend!
