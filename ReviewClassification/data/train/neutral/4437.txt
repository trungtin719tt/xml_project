A very easy read. I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this book, but the first sentence, "Just when I thought my day couldn't get any worse, I saw the dead guy standing next to my locker.", got my attention.The House of Night Series is yet another addition to the vampire/vampyre genre. Veering off of the traditional vampire path, in this series, vampyres are chosen and Marked, not Changed by being bitten, and not all those who have been Marked actually live through the Change.In Marked, the first book in the series, 16 year old Zoey Redbird is Marked by a vampyre Tracker and becomes a fledgling vampyre. She goes off to vampyre training school where she learns that she stands out as "special" among all the other fledglings there. In many ways it's a typical high school drama type story with the predictable characters. However there are enough twists and turns to make the story interesting.Just a couple 'heads up' because some people will find this offensive and because it's a young adult novel I wouldn't want any parents allowing their kids to read this based on my review without pointing out the following:1. The "f" word is salt and peppered throughout the book.2. By chapter 7, Zoey stumbles upon a scene she wishes she hadn't. Aphrodite, the school's High Priestess in training is desperately trying to convince Erik, an absolutely gorgeous upperclassman, that he really does want her to give him a "blow job." It was slightly explicit, and was something that was discussed in casual conversation a few times throughout the book.
