This is not really a review of the general contents and themes ofLittle House on the Prairie, but more my personal attitudes towards the fact that this book has been (and like so many others) repeatedly challenged and even at times banned/censored (mostly due to the way Native Americans are depicted and the attitudes shown towards them).There are definite issues withLittle House on the Prairie, and especially the attitudes towards Native Americans are problematic to say the least. However, attitudes towards Native Americans in the 19th century were often very much akin to those shown in the book, and the claim that the "only good Indian is a dead Indian" was unfortunately common amongst many settlers (like the Scotts, who I think, uttered these words). Those who would challenge these books and attempt to have them banned are thus not only being censorious, but even worse, are attempting to erase the unfortunate truth that Native Americans were often seen in this way.Little House on the Prairiewould, in my opinion, be a good starting point for discussions, although I do realise the book could also be used and likely has been used by those against Native Americans to bolster and justify their own prejudices (however, this can be and has been the case with many, if not most controversial books, and will likely remain thus).Frankly, while I have more than a bit of trouble with the way Native Americans are depicted and the attitudes shown towards them (I especially find the often glowing descriptions of Caroline Ingalls a bit hard to stomach, as she is really quite the stereotyper, much more so than Charles Ingalls, although not on the same level as the Scotts), I do very much appreciate the fact that Laura Ingalls Wilder has not tried pretend that attitudes towards Native Americans were different and more positive (if she had, for example, written stories about the Ingalls family becoming close to and good friends with their Native American neighbours, although this might feel more acceptable to our modern sensibilities, it also would be, for the most part, woefully and perhaps even dangerously anachronistic).And finally, one must realise that whileLittle House on the Prairieis considered historical fiction, it was also written at a time when negative impressions of or at the very least patronising and Euro-centric attitudes to Native Americans were still very much not only acceptable, but common. The book describes the past, but is also of its time, and should be read, appreciated and approached as such.I also wonder, whether those individuals who believe thatLittle House on the Prairieshould be banned and/or censored consider themselves to be educated, to be socially active, to be fighting against bigotry and the like (and the answer would probably be a resounding "yes" for most). However, if one strives to ban or censor books, one is behahving (and no matter for what reason one attempts to ban or censor a book) the same or at least in a similar manner as that against which one is fighting. Education, understanding, solidarity will never be reached, nor will the battle against bigotry ever be won by using similarly problematic (and draconian) means, but through thoughtful discussion and debate (in my opinion, banning books, no matter for what purpose, is and always will be an act of bigotry, an act of dictatorial over-reaching, an act that destroys freedom and only creates more strife).
