Nothing new or Earth shattering here, but if you like Beauty and the Beast, its a super fast and an enjoyable read.I sort of beyond love the story of Beauty and the Beast,as a child I loved fairy tales, but this was always my favourite. My mum likes to tell people how when asked why I like this one so much, I would say "Beauty had the best shake outta life" and she did for reals. I was a realistic child I saw these fairy tales for what they were:Cinderellabasically a maid who didn't get paid...GrossPocahontasHer whole life is camping.....GrossLittle MermaidDeep water creeps me outas do eels....GrossSnow WhiteThere are so many many many things that upset me but if she just took a basic lesson from raccoons and washed that apple Jessi may have had a few less nightmares growing up..Gross,Gross,GrosssBeauty got to live in a castle with magic servants who were invisible(no guilt)and read, there is a beast who thinks she's beautiful and lavishes gifts on her and only wants to win her heart. Um not gross.Because I love this story soooo much I am can be a little bit more critical of different versions,this one my only complaint is there is not a lot of time spent on the relationship between Beauty and Beast,very little emotional development, it was like boom! they were in love just by hanging out together, other then that fun read!
