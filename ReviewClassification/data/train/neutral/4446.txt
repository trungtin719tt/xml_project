Fear and Loathing captures the experience of visiting Vegas expertly. It's flashy and in-your-face and fun. Hunter S Thompson has a way with words and characters that immediately draw you into his absurd, drug-filled chronicle. Coherency isn't really his strong point, though. So like Vegas, it severely lacks substance. The chapters ramble along like episodes in a sitcom. All the tangents and digressions and paranoid hallucinations are page-turners for sure, but they don't really connect or go anywhere...The fact that this is semi-autobiographical really makes it worth reading, though. It's kind of a shame that how the story was compiled and published and the origin of it all isn't worked in somehow. That's what really gives Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas its unique place in literature.
