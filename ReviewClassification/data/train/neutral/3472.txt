2.5 stars. The Maze Runner isn't all bad, for dystopian YA fiction. That's kind of damning it with faint praise, but I just can't summon up a whole lot of enthusiasm for it. It was reasonably well-written and had a promising setting, but I found it a frustrating read on SO many levels:1. Other kids keep telling the main character not to ask questions, so, so often. It was incredibly annoying and -here's the capper - it turns out there's no real reason for that. Other than hiding the Big Mystery Ball from the reader a little while longer.2. Gary Stu. 'Nuff said.3. Lots of teenage boys die, and the reason just isn't compelling enough to justify it.(view spoiler)[The world is going to pot and some people think if they put a bunch of kids through a do-or-die trial where most of them will die, they'll get some tougher, smarter kids who will - somehow - lead them out of some unspecified global catastrophe? Kind of weak.(hide spoiler)]And maybe that's partly because...4. This is the first book in a series andwaytoo many questions were left unanswered.(view spoiler)[What's the catastrophe? Why would the Powers that Be think a bunch of teenagers, however smart, can solve it?(hide spoiler)]Who knows? I'm just not sure I care about the answers enough to read the sequels. Certainly not enough to buy them. Maybe I'd read them if someone put them in front of my face, but I'm not even sure about that.I gave the book to my older teenage son. He never read it. I tried to talk my younger teen into it. He usually likes this kind of fantasy, but no go. Maybe I just hate to admit I paid full retail price for a book that no one in my family will much like.
