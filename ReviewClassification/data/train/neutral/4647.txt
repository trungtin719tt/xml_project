I wanted to read this book for a while now, but I never had the opportunity because of time. I also didn't know this was based on a real story in history. The book was very easy to read, I enjoyed it. It was at times slow and predictable, but it was an okay read for all ages. Don't expect a super book, but I would read it again, so there for it gets 3 points
