For me, nothing Jane Austen wrote compares to my beloved Pride and Prejudice. That being said, for me, Persuasion's "love story", which is suppose to be her most "moving love story" ever, bored me. I thought the characters, mainly Anne's father and her annoying sisters, Elizabeth and Mary, were stiff and the " love story" between Anne and Captain Wentworth was flat. In Pride and Prejudice I could immediately feel the tension and heat between Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy. "Sigh".
