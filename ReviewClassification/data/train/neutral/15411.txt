a bit dicey in parts, some R-rated stories, too much violence, confusing, getting a PhD in it won't help, changes you when you read it (usually for the better; it's sometimes called "the book that knows me"), begins well ends in terror and joy (see what I mean about confusing?), only valid source of info about Jesus (but will the real Jesus please stand up?), needs an editor, you say you're going to read it straight through and you don't (you skip all the parts you can't pronounce or that bore you), needs more humor, lots of jeremiads and rantings, some really nice but overly emotional poetry, one-a-day wisdom vitamins, best book: Job or maybe Ecclesiastes, way too nationalistic in the first part, should come with a Surgeon General's warning, for some reason it still sells and keeps many of my friends employed trying to understand and teach it.Tom
