"Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts... A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind, clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding..."A modern classic, as archetypal as they get. Quite a few thoughts were explored, but not a lot of fun was had.WhileNeuromancerwas definitely ahead of its time, it is as if it's now stuck in a strange temporal limbo, belonging neither to the past, present or future. That is arguably its biggest strength, but also its weakness.Parts of the book's descriptions of potential future developments are unfortunately quite outdated, whereas others turned out to be more or less accurately estimated. It provides for a quite confusing, but simultaneously fascinating, setting.The writing does not help with this feeling, as the style is both alluring and offputting at the same time. I would find myself going back and forth between being engrossed in the beauty of the book, and simply wanting to put it away.My main takeaway fromNeuromanceris that it is a very strange book. Something that in my mind contains equal parts enjoyable and not enjoyable elements. It is undoubtedly a classic that deserves to be read, but to me, not necessarily a book to be enjoyed.
