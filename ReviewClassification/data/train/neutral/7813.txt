Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge #9: A book about a villain or antiheroI so wish I'd read this as a kid. I would have devoured the entire series in a matter of days! However, as an adult, this book isn't much more than a fun fantasy adventure, so I can't give it any higher than 3 stars. It was entertaining, but nothing special in the long run. (Highly recommend it to all kids though!!)
