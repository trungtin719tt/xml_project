I've only ever watched theWalt DisneyMovie, and to be very honest I didn't even know it was based on a book.While readingThe Fireman;Joe Hill'sprotagonist adores Mary Poppins and Julie Andrews. So obviously I had to see the movie again - actually I think I last saw it as a little girl. As an adult I've come to read the credits of the films more carefully; thus discovering this movie was based on books byP. L. Travers. I went on a hunt and got hold of the first book.This was very, very different from the movie I've always watched and adored.Mary Poppinsis a total different person in the book, she is more self-centered and narcissistic and kind of rude.The Childrenconsist of Jane and Michael - whom we know form the movie - but they also have baby twins John and Barbara.The Plot:This is the part I liked more than the movie, it was told in these little stories form chapter to chapter meeting new and interesting characters every time. Don't get me wrong, I loved Bert and the"Movie Plot"but this was where the real magic happens in the book. Dancing Cow's, Stars on Gingerbread, visits to the four corners of the world, talking to animals and birthdays at the zoo.I enjoyed this book, and will try and find the others.Maybe reading all will explain more on why the Movie is so different form the first book. I might be wrong but I think the movie was based on all the books not just the first.
