That was kind of underwhelming..The Awakeningdefinitely left me wanting more. I just feel like it was missing so much which is a shock to me because these book are huge.Chloe was so annoying in this book. I wanted to stab my eyes so I didn't have to see her trying to flirt with everyone and anyone that walked. I honestly gave zero fucks about her until she found out she was apart of a experimental group thing. Honestly, I only cared a little bit - I mostly just wanted the book to be over.. or something to happen that would grab my attention.Back to Chloe. She constantly made terrible, silly, and super stupid decision throughout the whole book. My eyes hurt from all the rolling I've done today. Derek was interesting because he called her out on her shit.. but then Simon was an annoying twat defending the ground she walked on. UGH!Overall, I wanted this book to end. I wanted it to be either shorter and suck.. or longer and way more exiting! I got neither. I'm just disappointed in this book and I pray that the next one is a lot better.
