I learned a lesson about why I should finish books, even if the story does not grip me and I find the protagonist boring. (Thanks, book club) Initially, I thought... oh man... middle aged man making bitter jokes out of his miserable life. I felt sorry for his wife.However, as I realized what was happening as I got farther and farther into the book, I found myself wishing there was a sequel because I want to know what happened to Ethan a year or two down the road. Was he able to live with himself? Was the money worth it?As always, Steinbeck's prose is real, fresh, and able to be read on several levels. After this first read, I have a feel for the book and it's major social themes. I do like a book that raises more questions than it answers, and I think this book does that well.
