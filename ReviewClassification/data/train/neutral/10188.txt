I stumbled across some interesting background toThe Merchant of Venicelast month when I was reading Andrew Dickson White's comprehensiveHistory of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom. From earliest times, the Christian Church had probihited usury. This was defined as "lending out money at interest"; it was regarded as one of the vilest of sins, and one that would invariably lead to eternal damnation. In cases where people had been convicted of usury after their deaths, they could even be dug up and removed from sanctified ground. So hardly any Christian would consider it; but Jews, who were going to be faced with eternal damnation whatever they did, could be usurers without risking anything extra. Since there are many circumstances where people want to borrow money, Jews were consequently encouraged to become usurers. In many places, they couldn't find any other employment.In the end, though, it got to be too complicated. With a growing economy and the invention of the corporation, the demand for capital became such that other people wanted to get into banking. So, starting around the late sixteenth century, the definition of usury was gradually modified to mean "lending out money atexcessiveinterest". It was still a mortal sin, but it didn't mean the same thing any more. According to White, the Church never formally admitted that they'd changed the rules of the game.Shylock seems to have been operating around the beginning of the changeover, and I think he got sideswiped by this collision between the medieval and modern views of the world. I feel even more sorry for him.
