I love Thoreau's ideals. Taking care of nature is of paramount importance, especially these days as technology flings us farther and faster into the future than we've ever gone before.I also loveWaldenbecause I grew up near the pond and would pass it on my way into Boston back in the days when I was a young English major in college. Back then I looked upon this book and its ethos as a rallying banner for people who gave a shit about Mother Earth.Given a bit of reflection after a more recent reread, I feel like there's a hitch in Thoreau's practical theory. I mean, he went out there and survived in a cabin in the woods for a couple years and then wrote a book saying that everyone is capable of doing the same, and he got a little uppity about the people who did not. However, with no one else to care for but himself, Thoreau's wilderness trials weren't the same as what they'd be if you had to do this your whole life with no reprieve and a family in tow. Plus, even though it was a rougher landscape back then, spending a little time in the rural Massachusetts suburbs doesn't cut it, imo. Heck, even back then he could have hopped a train passing on the tracks adjacent to the pond and been back in Boston within the hour.However, that doesn't wholly detract from my warm fuzzy feelings forWaldenand what it stands for.
