I go to a lot of conventions and comic cons. While I'm there, I usually pick up a sampling of books from my fellow writers. Sometimes I am given free copies. I don't think I let that affect my reviews, but I like to be transparent about such things. This is one that I bought for the intriguing premise, and the charming author signed it to me.As always, I wish to avoid spoilers, but as the back cover of the book reveals that Laurel has to deal that a blossom similar to wings is opening up on her back, I think I'll share that with you right away. Laurel is also a young woman with a mysterious past, who is trying to merge into normal high school life in a small town. She has always felt she was different, and now she will discover just how different she is. And how special.This could have been a very formulaic tale about the teenage girl on the outskirts of high school society who discovers she is not only different but different in a wonderful way. Aprilynne Pike dodges that. Laurel will discover that her differences, while possibly marvelous, also put her in the way of great dangers. By the end of the book, first in a series, the reader can foresee that she is going to have to face some very difficult choices in the days to come. She is going to have to grope her way forward to find her destiny, and her survival.This isn't a book where the happy ending is that everything was reset to the once normal life the protagonist enjoyed. First in the series Avalon.
