I'm in that small minority of readers of urban fantasy who hasn't read this series or watchedTrue Blood, the television show based on these books. After reading this story, I'm not quite sure what all the fuss is about but I'm intrigued enough to continue on.Sookie Stackhouse is a waitress at Merlotte's in the small Louisiana town of Bon Temps. She has what she refers to as a "disability," simply a telepathic "ability." Yes, she can hear people's thoughts (with a few exceptions). When Bill Compton shows up at the bar, Sookie quickly recognizes him as a vampire and forms a friendship with him. In this world, vampires are "out" and live amongst humans. There are other aspects of this world that are unique but I'll leave that for personal discovery. Things become interesting when it appears there's a serial killer at large and vampires become the prime suspects, especially Bill.I liked the story, didn't love it. Harris provides a level of descriptive detail that I found tedious until I listened to a portion of the audio version, recommended by a GR friend. It's apparent that this story is written specifically to the personality of the character and townspeople and it then made sense. I read the rest of the book with the narrator's voice in my head and it made a big difference. I'll continue the series but only listening to the audio version. I didn't guess the murderer and, rare for me, didn't care because there was so much going on.I liked Sookie, her friends, acquaintances &amp; co-workers and want to see where she goes from here. 3.5 stars
