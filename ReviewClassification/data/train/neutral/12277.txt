The adventures continue &amp; this one breaks from the original romance into very bizarre terrain. Still terrific enough to make me keep reading 'em.Everyone around Sookie is threatened, &amp; she gets beat up in every single book. She endures so much and how much time has elapsed? Actually two seasons... only half a year! That she endures so much and the fact that the plot breaks at times, goes many places except where you think it will go (main characters can die within two pages, sometimes two paragraphs... no one is safe... all is fair game!), all this is so admirable &amp; new &amp; rad to read.
