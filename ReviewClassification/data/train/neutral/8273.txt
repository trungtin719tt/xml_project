Having read the first book back in Christmas and feeling confused about the reading order I'll say that this was a very enjoyable and easy to read children's book. I'm still struggling to find out who the reading order of Narnia is. I've seen that this is either the 2nd or the 5th book but then again I've seen it being named the 3rd book. I'm just going to read it however I want and hope it'll all be fine. At least, I don't there was any missing detail from the book, so that must be a good thing.As to why I gave this 3 stars is because I found it less adventurous than the first one, I felt this one was a bit rushed and yes that's the way children's books usually are but it was a bit too much for me. I loved the characters, although some of the characters of the first book were missing, but we had a new one on the children side, and several new ones on the world of Narnia.A journey in the sea on a ship named Dawn Treader. C. S. Lewis is a masterful author, very laconic but at the same time his words are utterly descriptive. The thing with children's books is that they always make me feel nostalgic and give me this feeling we all had as children, I feel carefree.
