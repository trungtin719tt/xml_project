For people who don't already know: the hotel used in the movie actually exists. It'sThe Headlands Hotel, Newquay, England, and I've eaten there several times.The staff are friendly and well aware of the relevant history. If you ask, they'll show you the room where the witches had their big meeting and the spot where the baby carriage nearly gets pushed off the cliff. The food is good, and you get a fantastic view over the bay, where people surf in summer. Recommended!
