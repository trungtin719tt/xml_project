yup, i have now ticked box where it says this book is one of the must read classics and i think that's the highlight of my reading experience that i have with this story.there are many things that are hard to believe about this story, like why only teenagers got stranded on the island? other than few no one said anything about going home? violence among these kids is not such a big thing as this is a common occurrence nowadays. this book depicts how easily humans could turn violent, and their desire to rule fellow humans but i was also expecting another trait of human nature to come out and that was being stand united against oppression. Sadly, that did not happen.definitely a disturbing read but not an outstanding story in today's world.
