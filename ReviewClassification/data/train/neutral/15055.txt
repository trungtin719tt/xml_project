I enjoyed the writing style of Jonathan Stroud. Most young adult authors have one style and one perspective. I found the voice of Bartimaeus hilarious and the highlight of the book. The footnotes were odd at first but after getting to know the demon it just fit.Because of Barttimaeus' style it overshadowed Nathaniel's chapters. Some of them were almost dull and at the beginning I found myself irritated when I saw I had another "Nathaniel" chapter to read.It could have done without some of the suggestive material.I had read reviews that this was a "Harry Potter knockoff" but I found it completely different from the Harry Potter books in almost every way except for the fact that it has to do with magic and a boy. Even then, it is the "Batimaeus Trilogy" that happens to have a boy in it.Will read the next book in the series.
