I think missed the best by date for this book. It's more fun than an introductory course in sociology and covers some of the same material. Reminded me ofBellwetherbyConnie WillisandWilliam Gibson's Blue Ant series. All looking for the point where people change behavior and a new trend begins.I loved the part about creating the children's education tv programsSesame StreetandBlue's Clues. What worked with preschoolers, and what didn't.It seems likely Gladwell relies on his enthusiasm for his theory more than fact. That being said, I'll probably read more of his books. It's good food for thought.
