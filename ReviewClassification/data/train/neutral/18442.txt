There are a lot of great reviews for this book so I'll be short. Considering the year it was written, the futuristic aspects were good. Murder mystery was okay. What I didn't like was the romance part. I am very easy to sell on couples and love stories. Just gimme some steam and sappy thoughts, and put the couple together in an okay way and I'm rooting for them. Here, I just couldn't root for the romance. Heroine was too robotic or too indistinct in that setting. Still, I enjoyed the book and will read the rest of the series. I think the world building could turn out great!
