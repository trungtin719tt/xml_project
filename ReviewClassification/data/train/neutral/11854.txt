It may be that you need a "Super Sad True" in the title, for this is the only way the tale could be made relevant and contemporary in the year 2017. The jock-&amp;-Italian-girl thing may of once been deemed, you know, sultry. As exotic for this WASP-y crowd as anything else. (Right now, 20-yr olds getting married seems a bigger, more exotic, waaaay rarer occurrence.)Snarky and sexy teens? ALWAYS in vogue. &amp; tales of new-but-doomed love? Hella DITTO.
