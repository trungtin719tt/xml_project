2.5 to 3 starsThis is probably going to be an unpopular opinion. I don't think I have ever seen on statuses for books I have read before so many people professing their love for a book! But, for me it was everything from just okay at times to drawn out and boring. Sorry everyone! *ducks as things are thrown his way*Another thing thing that I am not sure I liked or disliked, or if it even added to the story, was the excessive gore and shocking content. Let me be clear, I am all about gore and shock, but I like for it to have a role in progressing or adding to the story. If it seems like the author is just thinking,"let's add some weird sex or someone having their toenails pulled off with a staple remover - that should get the readers moaning and groaning!" well, then I tend not to care quite as much for it. In this case, the gruesome shocks and twisted behavior are, in my opinion, borderline useful for the story.Regarding my drawn out comment - I feel like if this book was 200 pages shorter it would have been just fine and I would have enjoyed it a lot more. I kept feeling like I was lost in the weeds of the odd occurrences in this dark town. I often wondered if the book was still on point or if the author had gone off on an extended tangent for some reason. The ramblings did not a tight and fulfilling reading experience make.This book was originally written in Swedish. It often reminded me style wise of other Swedish authors I have read (specifically Jo Nesbo and Stieg Larsson). So, there definitely seems to be a Swedish fiction writing style.I think many horror fans will enjoy this book despite my feelings on it. With so many positive vibes from others, I am just sad that I couldn't see it myself!
