I'm apparently the crankiest person on earth, because this was my least favorite Potter book yet. (AZKABAN being my favorite!) It's mostly because:1. There is too much tournamenting for my taste.2. I hate the house elves. :O3. The word "quietly" is egregiously overused. It loses its effectiveness because it appears so often.4. There are moments when Harry and Ron behave like stereotypical stupid boys (I know, I know, they're 14...doesn't mean I can't be annoyed with them.)The book gets an extra star because the last 10 chapters were very good, though, and I loved:1. that Hermione gets a makeover, but then matter-of-factly says it's too much trouble to straighten her hair every day.2. the creepy thing in the blanket3. Cedric! Poor brave boy.(view spoiler)[WHY DID NO ONE TELL ME.(hide spoiler)]
