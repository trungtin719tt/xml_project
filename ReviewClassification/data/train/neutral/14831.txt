I was ready to loveThe Story of Edgar Sawtelle. It was one of the biggest publishing hits in 2008 - it captured the attention of writers such as Richard Russo and Stephen King. and was picked up by Oprah for her book club. Quite a feat for a debut novel!David Wroblewski spent 10 years writing this bool - both a classic "boy and his dog" coming of age story and a sweeping saga of an American family set in rural northern Wisconsin in the 1950's. It's big - over 600 pages. It's ambitious and captivating, becoming increasingly more difficult to put down as the pages turn. With Edgar Sawtelle Wroblewski has created a protagonist who might have been fondly remembered with other famous personas of American literature in years to come - but at the same time his work is recognizably flawed, with the third act particularly to blame.Edgar Sawtelle is a mute boy born to a family of dog breeders, who live at the outskirts of the Chequamegon forest in remote northern Wisconsin. The Sawtelle dogs are famous for being excellently bred and trained, and buyers seek them out because of their behavior, not looks. Wroblewski devotes a significant amount of pages to the techniques of dog training and the process itself - but he has a great descriptive talent and the novel never lags, pulling in even the readers who have no interest in the subject. Edgar is a wonderful protagonist - although mute, he speaks clearly through sign language to both dogs and humans alike. Wroblewski does a great job at developing Edgar's bond with the dogs - it's natural both for him and his protagonist.But something is rotten in northern Wisconsin. By now it's no secret thatThe Story of Edgar Sawtelleis a more or less obvious retelling ofHamlet, which is probably it's greatest flaw. The shadow of Shakespeare's play hangs over it and never lets it become a sovereign work. And it's such a shame, as I can definitely sense a great novel in here - only it's not allowed to surface. In the end the characters, human and canine, are merely reduced to their respective Shakespearean parts - whether they want it, or not, and merely play their roles. More and more unanswered questions and wasted opportunities pile up, as the novel goes down in flames in the third act - predictably so, all too much.The Story of Edgar Sawtellereads like a great novel that could have been - an opportunity stolen by the author who desperately clung to rewriting an already well known Shakespearean tragedy and abandons all the ideas which made his own work interesting in the first place.
