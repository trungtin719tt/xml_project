Marg bought 4 of these books for the upcoming grandmonster &amp; asked me to mail them. They're in a nifty 4"x6" thick cardboard format, unlike the ones we had for our kids. Hopefully harder for little fingers to tear. I had to read them first. I remember this one well. Pretty good, although not the best. Cute pictures, though.
