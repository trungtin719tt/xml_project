Now that was a lot of information. Too much.Valentino Achak Deng is one of the lost boys of the civil war in Sudan. He survived a genocide, walking from Sudan to Ethiopia where boys were getting picked off one by one by lions in the night. Crocodiles, vultures, dysentery, soldiers tying to blow him up, starvation, a car accident, and a robbery in Atlanta after being relocated to the US.Life has not been easy for Valentino. Yet he somehow keeps going with a positivity that is hard to believe. The story is moving, and Dave Eggers can sure turn a phrase, but there was so much detail.....(oh my poor overloaded head) if this hadn't been an audiobook I never would have gotten through it.But that does not mean that I don't admire Valentino, or that I believe his story (and that of Sudan) should not have been told. I do.It just that, less is more sometimes.3.5 stars.
