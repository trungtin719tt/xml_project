3.5 stars*While this book was interesting and very enjoyable there were a few things that I struggled with.1) The pacing. I found the pacing to be very slow and felt that nothing happened. The same thing seemed to happen all the time. Within the first 150 pages I was bored and struggled to get into the book, I honestly thought about DNFing it. I am not a huge fan of books that have a slow pace.2) The writing. I don't know what it is but I am not a fan of the writing style. I found it hard to read at times, mostly at the beginning of the book and was often getting confused about what was happening. There were times where I had to read a paragraph or a sentence more than once just to understand what was happening.I liked the plot and the storyline. It is an interesting world that Bray has invented and I am keen to learn more.
