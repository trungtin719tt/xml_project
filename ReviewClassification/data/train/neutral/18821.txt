Garden spells is fun, it reminded me of Practical Magic by Alice Hoffman though. Both include two sisters who are descendents of a weird, magical family, which is ostracized by the small town's folks that they live next to. Also similar to Practical Magic is the violence in one sister's past that she is trying to get away from. Magical realism isn't usually a genre that I enjoy, but it seems to work well here. My book group at the library chose this, but I am glad I gave it a try.
