I read this on a summer holiday, I recall being in a caravan and also being at the beach at the time. Isn't it funny the things that we remember whilst revisiting a book. This was a really nice story, Mr Sparks will always deliver a sweet story with angst and emotion, and always a message thrown in for reflection as well.
