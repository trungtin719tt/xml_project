This is the second Nicholas Sparks book that I have read; the first being The Notebook. This is a follow up to that book focusing on one of Noah's daughters. It was a decent read but not quite as engaging as The Notebook. It could be the "male perspective" that comes across so clearly to me. However, that being said, I suppose as a married woman, I should be glad to have a closer look at the "male perspective." I am getting used to Sparks' style of writing which I wouldn't say is quite chic lit.The story was a bit slow in the beginning but I really enjoyed the ending which turned out quite romantic. The book offers hope that marriages can be turned around for the better if a positive effort is put forth and both parties aren't quite ready to let go.
