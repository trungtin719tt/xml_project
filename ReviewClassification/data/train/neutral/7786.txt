The biggest problem I had with this book was the fact that it made me feel...nothing.I didn't feel connected to the characters or to any part of the plot. This is quite a bummer, as it deals with a pretty heavy topic.I feel like the author intended to write the story this way though, because the writing style in general has a certain type of "coldness" to it, and the true feelings of a character are never really explored. Some people might not be bothered by this, but I personally simply prefer feeling close and connected to the characters of a story.This doesn't make the entire book bad though. It certainly was interesting, andBernhard Schlinkis skillful with how he uses words. He describes mundane activities in a wonderful and fascinating way, and this makes me understand 100% why so many schools choose this novel as part of their required reading material.I also appreciated how he always got straight to the point, instead of writing unnecessary details to prolong the plot points we all already know are coming.I also couldn't help but feel disgusted at the things taking place in the first part of the book, and I wish the problematic aspects were explored further, instead of just brushing upon the issue later on.Overall, this was a good book to read inbetween, but nothing life changing or special.
