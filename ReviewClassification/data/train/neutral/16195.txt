3.5Ruins of Gorlanwas a book I read when I first started high school, which was in 2010, I think. I graduated last year so I refuse to acknowledge maths. It's a book I've hunted for a while now, and I'm so glad to have my hands on it that it's ridiculous.I did have problems with this book during my re-read though. Maybe because it's a middle grade book, probably not. However, this book reads like an introductory novel. We barely get much action but are instead introduced to the world of the story.The story we have is about a 15 year old orphan named Will. In his kingdom when a ward of the Baron turns 15 there is a chance for craft masters to take on apprentices, to train them to be a great knight, cook, or diplomat. Will, a small boy, has his eyes set on being a knight. However, when the Choosing Day comes he is not given a position that will grant him knighthood, he is however chosen by the mysterious Ranger - a craft no one knows much about bar from the Rangers. It is rumoured they know magic from the way they blend into the shadows. At first, Will has an aversion to the position. But, as Halt, his master, and him grow closer he learns to love his craft.That is basically the plot of this particular book. We get several perspectives in the book, but the two which continue to pop up are Horace, a ward who Will grew up with, and Will. Also, despite the plot being slightly boring, the descriptions are beautiful and the characters are developed beautifully. For example, the Baron, and the fact no one seems to understand his sense of humour.CharactersWillis our small main character. At 15 he is quite scrawny and aims to be a knight. It's all he's ever wanted since he was put on a doorstep of the castle without a second name. He has created a story after being told his father was a hero. As a Ranger though he finally feels at home with Halt.Will was a pretty interesting character. As a young boy it wasn't as interesting to me considering I'm an 18 year old girl, but I still loved his perspectives.(view spoiler)[Him and Alyss have always been my otp as well.(hide spoiler)]It was nice to be back in his head after all these years where I wasn't and had forgotten the story. I loved his relationships with his friend, how one developed with Horace, his relationship with both Tug and Halt as well.His character could have been developed a bit more, but it will be in later books, but he is ultimately loyal to a fault and brave.Horacewas the bully when him and Will were the wards of the Baron. He used his strength against him, Will using his wit to outsmart Horace. Horace is recruited into battle school on his path to knighthood, and he's great. He's smart and great with a sword, except now he's on the receiving end of bullies. Three second year apprentices making his life a living hell at the school. Thankfully, that sorts itself out thanks to both Halt and Will.Horace had some incredible character development purely in this first book. He changed from an obnoxious and boastful character into one who could joke about his shortcomings and refrained from mentioning his positives. I really loved his chapters, and the insight into the other school.(view spoiler)[Do him and Jenny get together as well? I can't remember!(hide spoiler)]World-BuildingThis book is primary world-building so it was incredibly well developed. It is a historical feeling world with magic elements to it. You have Knights, castles, Baron's, and Ladies. But, there is also the element of Wargals and different beasts which weren't present in that time period.I love the world, personally. I think it's perfectly done by the author and an absolute stand out.PlotWas pretty subpar, which is why I've rated this book 3 stars. I know the later books have much more vibrant plots, this book was purely getting us into the world and introducing the antagonist who will appear later.I still loved the plot in this book, Will's journey into loving being a Ranger.I also still had favourite parts. For example, a Ranger's horse needs to be asked before you're allowed to ride it. Each horse had a unique phrase and you must say it before being allowed on the horse. This completely eliminates the element of stealing.(view spoiler)[The fact that both WillandHorace were bucked off Tug was hilarious!(hide spoiler)]WritingThe writing was a tad wordy in some places. But, it was descriptive to the point you were hearing and seeing what the protagonist did. The Ranger's job is to see everything, and to do so you must use all your senses, so the author describes everything in a way where you are able to understand what is happening perfectly.I also liked the fact that despite the fact a few people had grey hair it was always describe in different hues so I wasn't picturing the same character in the same way. This goes for other words too, I'm just using grey as an example.OverallI recommend this book if you're looking to return to your middle grade roots, or just have a fast read. The characters are interesting. The world is interesting. The crafts are interesting. Women aren't even discriminated against, they're given crafts as well. So, I definitely recommend this without a doubt despite how my rating may seem low.
