Watching the movie helped me with this play. My edition was a little hard to follow with the lines all over the place. I liked the beginning of this play, but then it gets boring by the middle of the third act (exactly where the movie got boring). This isn't a bad play, but the story is pretty predicable because it's become so well known.
