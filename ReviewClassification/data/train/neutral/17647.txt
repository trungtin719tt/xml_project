Jondalar is a boring, annoying Gary Stu. Reading about him and Thonolan bored me to tears.Ayla is still sometimes interesting, but her feats are becoming absolutely ridiculous. Honestly, being the first person to tame a horse, create a cart (without wheels, but still), create fire with stone sparks, tame a cave lion (sure, he was a baby, and close to death, but why wouldn't he have eaten her when he got a little older? Don't believe it), and use stitches on a wound? Her sudden grasp of Jondalar's language was stupid as well, like the author said, 'well, I'm getting bored with all these language barrier issues, so Ayla's just going to get it now.'And the sex? Totally unnecessary. I don't consider myself a prude, but I like my novels to be mostly sex free, because it's really hard to write good sex (and this was not good sex). Jondalar the Sex God seems to be the author's fantasy man, and why in the world would Ayla, who's only every had sex with one man before, and only every had one child, be able to take his huge p*nis more easily than all the older, more experienced women he'd had before then? I understand now why the reviews I read before starting the series called it caveman porn. And it's all Jondalar's fault - hate that irritating character.
