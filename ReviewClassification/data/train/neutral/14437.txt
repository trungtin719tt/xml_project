Oh Werther, Werther, Werther. Someone got a little bit fixated didn't they? Taking a leaf straight out of Shakespeare's lover-lorn rule book (see Ophelia as example number one of a tragedy waiting to happen) Werther turns loving friendship into a full blown stalker obsession.Here's a handy Werther style guide to obsession;1. Meet a friendly young lady.2. Be forewarned that she is already betrothed to another, and then pay no heed.3. Write, think and talk about nothing else apart from the object of your amour.4. Consider murdering your loved ones fiance5. Find a shady corner to carry out further obsessing6. Run away to join the army (unsuccessfully)7. Make dramatic overtures about ending it allI suspect Werther is a curiously individual example of amorous obsession for the late 18th century, mainly because he is a man. At this time women were generally supposed to be more inclined to this kind of romantic pining. Men on the other hand were billed as stoic, detatched and generally got whichever girl they wanted. When women were thought to be driven mad for "wont of love", much like Werther in this book, it was thought to be some kind of brain fever brought on by an excess of emotion. In reality most of them were driven mad by the sexual frustration caused by the rules set in place by society at the time. So I guess the question is, was Werther really such an ardent romantic or do his letters just express pent up sexual frustration couched in more socially acceptable terms?
