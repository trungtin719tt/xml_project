Ok, so I really hated the last book and I told myself I wasn't going to read anymore of this series, but I came across a cheap electronic version and I couldn't help myself. I am glad I did. This book was so much better than the previous ones, my only two complaints are: 1. too short!! and 2. I know this is targeted towards a young audience, but come on, does Zoe really need multiple love interests in every book!!!? And to make it worse, does she really have to fall "head over heels" for EVERY guy that shows even remote interest? Ugh, it drives me crazy when a strong and otherwise independent heroine seems to need male attention 24/7 to feel worthwhile. Once again, I am not some feminist-nazi-men-hater, I love romance. I think it's great, but when it seems that it is only thrown in to keep readers interested and appeased, it really kills it for me. If not for complaint number two, I probably would have given it one more star.I enjoyed the way Zoe and friends learned the importance of forgiveness. I especially enjoyed seeing the "geek squad" learn to be a little less self-centered and realize that the world does not revolve around them (trust me, I was well into my twenties when that idea finally started to dawn on me. Not that I have mastered it yet, either). They finally understood why Zoe had to do things the way she did and they even felt a bit ashamed for their selfish reaction and unwillingness to see things from her perspective.I also loved the way this book brought in beliefs and traditions from different cultures and faiths. I also enjoyed seeing Zoe realize that there is bad and good in all groups (not all Christians are bad, not all vampyres are loyal to their goddess, etc.)
