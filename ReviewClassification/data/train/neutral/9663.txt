I think the best way to describe this novel is as a crime-thriller type book but except for the first and last few chapters the detective is not in the book. The main characters are low-level drug dealers who work the local bars. There is a bit of intrigue and some twists and turns but overall there were a few things lacking for me. One was that the police were not realistic in the few appearances that they do make. I have a hard time believing any of the interactions with Scott - especially during his final interview. The Elephant tree wasn't quite as prominent as I would have thought, or the philosophy of the uncle and the link to the tree not quite as well developed as could have been. The pacing was fairly good and it did (mostly) keep my interest.So, overall, an OK first book - and certainly better than I ever could have done. Just not a strong enough book for me overall. I would not avoid this author but probably wouldn't seek him out either.
