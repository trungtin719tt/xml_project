I have rarely been so unpleasantly surprised - and bitterly disappointed - by the sudden turn that a novel takes as with the abrupt shift that occurs roughly mid-way through John FowlesThe Magus. The first half introduced the ethereal, creepy and gripping experiences of the young Englishman Nicholas Urfe, estranged from his Australian girlfriend Alison and teaching at a boys school on the remote Greek island of Phraxos. Thoroughly disenchanted with the course his life has taken, and gauging with a contemplative eye the distance between the top of the sheer cliffs on the island's shore and the teal waters far below, he stumbles upon the private villa of the mysterious Greek millionaire Maurice Conchis. Select lines from T. S. Eliot'sLittle Giddingpoint beguilingly towards the direction that Conchis' tutoring will lead Nicholas - and this early part, with its spectral hauntings, shadowy tales told in charcoal tongues, and erotic temptations from a nubile maiden, one of the troupe that enacts themasquesthat Conchis enjoys performing, was very good and left me eager to have the mystery solved, the seeingly supernatural elements either explained or expanded upon.Unfortunately, the book then takes a complete left-turn, an increasingly silly shift into the psychoanalysis of the confused Nicholas, a vast and complex pantomime that goes from one climax to another, all pointing towards a ridiculous amount of time, money, and effort expended upon the most pedestrianafter-school specialof a goal. It's almost like Fowles had one book in mind when he began writing, then discovered the works of Jung and Freud and Laing and Lacan during a sabbatical, became consumed with their themes and ideas, and decided to resume the novel in a completely different direction. It is still well-written, and I hung through to the end, but toss me in the fridge and call me Frosty, but was I ever pissed with how this sucker turned out. A truly intriguing and otherwordly tale made clinical and cold in the most frustrating of ways (though I realize that, for others, the novel could be the obverse: a cheesy spook-story having been made into a superb analysis of the faults and deceits of an arrogant young man's life, a mind-fuck of the first order).The Maguspresents the lamentable case of a potential five-star hit at the box office going off the rails and exiting the theaters early as an average three-star read.
