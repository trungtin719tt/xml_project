2.5 to 3.0 stars. Decent follow up toThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxyby Douglas Adams. While enjoyable, I did not find myself laughing as often as I did during the first one. With books like this, your mood is often an important factor in determining your level of enjoyment so it could be that I just wasn't as receptive to the story as I might otherwise have been. Good but not great.
