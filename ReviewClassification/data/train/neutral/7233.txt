To some extent, it felt like this text had no ultimate resolution. While I can pinpoint some of the themes exploited in this (and they are all very relevant and decently well analysed), I still did not love this as much as I wanted to. Everything pointed to a play that I would love, but there is something in the unfolding that keeps the play away from being in any way memorable. It is a good play, but it could have been really good.However, I have also recently seen it played on a theatre scene, which might or might not interfere with my opinion of this book, as unfortunately I did not get to witness a first class rendering. The Blanche in that version was annoying and overly pretentious. And she yelled too much.
