[3.5 Stars] This was pretty good, but I was a little conflicted about my rating. If I hadn't already read the Spiderwick Chronicles this would have gotten a higher rating, but alas I have. They had elements that were fairly similar and as a result I didn't enjoy this as much as I should have. I also think I'm just spoiled by Chris Riddell and Paul Stewart when it comes to middle grade. Regardless this was a fun read, and I'll definitely continue on!
