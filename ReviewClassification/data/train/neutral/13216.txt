I FINALLY FINISHED. WOW.In my opinion, this book could (and should) have been way shorter. The only reason this book is so long is because the author felt it necessary to go into tons of detail about each character's backstory before killing them off. I can see why some people might like that, but it didn't work for me.I really enjoyed the ending though, so I'm glad I pushed through! I also loved how brutal this book was, both in terms of the violence and the way the characters interacted with each other. They swore and did all sorts of crazy things, and none of that is hidden from the reader which I thought was really refreshing. This one is definitely not your typical YA novel (if you'd even call it that.)So overall I enjoyed this, but obviously didn't LOVE it.
