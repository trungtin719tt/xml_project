First of all i was not so happy about this book. It just felt like it was never ending. But it also was quite nice like how Lauren just thinks like okay 9 days to survive good luck! So now i'm looking forward to reading te next one bc i want to know what is going to happen! I also think Luce is just too dramatic, really really annoying tbh. Hopes she gets a little better in book4
