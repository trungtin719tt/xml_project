My second book by Ernest Hemingway. I liked this so much that I cried while finally closing the book.It must be the way Hemingway used his magic: the vivid descriptions of his locale. The war torn Italian picturesque villa and the use of rain as metaphor for hardship. The ying-yang kind of story: the "man's man" virile AmericanTenenteand the whimsical English-womanCatherine.The contrast between these two lovers is so opposite that's akin to the sun and moon that sometimes exist together in a dreamy late afternoon sky before everything turns dark. However, in the end, the moon ceased to shine and the sun tried to light up the sky but it was raining and the novel ended sad and the sun, being alone, was still lonely. This image was the reason why I cried.Apart from that sad ending, I also did not enjoy Catherine's delivery of dialogues particularly when she talked to her lover. Their conversations felt like childlike and immature. Also, my edition of this book has so many typographical errors. Paging Arrow Books, the publisher. Please hire a good proofreader. You are doing a great disservice to an otherwise exceptional literary work.
