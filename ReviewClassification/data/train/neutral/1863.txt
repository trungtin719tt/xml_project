Anne Rice's vampire chronicles made me love reading books. I mean, it didn't exactly start there. I can go back further in my childhood to other books, but as a "young adult" in my late teens, this series nailed it for me. I was captivated. They stayed with me and I thought about them for DAYS, weeks even. In retrospect, it was probably my first experience of "book depression." I wanted Lestat to turn me into a vampire. I think he was my first book boyfriend.This is my first re-read since the 90s, I think, and it didn't hold up as well as I'd hoped. Louis is a dreadful vampire. He has as much self-loathing as Bill Compton from the Sookie Stackhouse series. Sheesh. I found it dreadful to read from his POV. He hated being a vampire and was so melodramatic. I like to read about unapologetic vampires who thrive and are confident and kick-ass. This is NOT that kind of story.It does read like a "new" classic with lots of literary phrases and descriptions. It's well-written as a historical novel about an earlier Louisiana and France in the 1800s. It has a certain appeal. But I think that Louis is insufferable as a leading man. Claudia shines with what she is given. Lestat is sort of a villainous caricature here (readers know he is fleshed out in future books and becomes much more complex than any of the vampires in this series, for better or worse).I am not sure I will read this one again because it's just ... kind of boring to me now. Maybe I've outgrown it? I think I like a little morebitein my vampire books now.
