This was a re-read and I own a physical copy of the entire series!ACTUAL RATING: 3.5 starsWe have reached the end! And what a blooming emotional climax it was, to conclude an epic and adventurous series that had put a spark into my childhood many years ago. There were lots of characters present and for the majority of the time, I got confused with who was speaking and which books past characters had been a part of. Pacing again was a little choppy. The ending was rather heartbreaking but ultimately, C.S Lewis has crafted a series that I still think about and will do for many years to come.
