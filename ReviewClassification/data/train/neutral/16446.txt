I liked it. I didn't love it. After investing the time in this 960 page book, I admit I am somewhat disappointed. I really wanted to love it. I guess I was expecting an exciting adventure mixed with a beautiful love story. I got a long dry trip across the desert, a war story and a love story with very little romance. I did learn a lot from this story and I always appreciate that from a book. I learned about the culture of India and the caste system. I also learned about the second Afghan-Indian war. I enjoyed learning about the Corps of Guides.It did have a full cast of interesting characters and many of them I came to care about. Wally was probably my favorite character as his enthusiasm really brought his character to life. I had a bit of a hard time with the main character Ashton Pelham-Martyn. He did not always come across as believable to me. Many times his ideals and romanticism and dramatic reactions reminded me that he was written by a woman.The book did have many interesting and exciting parts, but I feel that it was entirely too long. All of the extra wording took away from the main story and made it at times very tedious and slow. There were places that were repetitive. Ash would explain a situation he was in and several pages later it would be re-told by a different character. There were a few phrases like...."as the crow flies" that were, in my opinion, over-used.I am glad I read it. I did enjoy Ash and Juli's story and wish we had spent more time with them together. I did feel the author's love of India and understood her message of tolerance. It could have been told in fewer words and been less sanctimonious at the end. If you enjoy a long slower paced saga, it's a worthwhile read.
