I knewRuby Redwouldn't be quite my type of YA lit after reading first couple of pages of it. Even though the main character, Gwyneth, is 16 going on 17, she sounds about 12. Naturally, a quick decision-maker that I am, I made up my mind to drop it right after finishing chapter 1. After finishing chapter 1 I decided to drop it after chapter 2, and so it went...Gwyneth is a member of the family of time-travelers. Every other generation or so her family produces a girl who starts uncontrollably travel into the past and back for short stretches of time at around the age of 16. This generation everyone thinks Gwen's cousin Charlotte is destined to be the next time-traveler. Only they are mistaken and it is Gwyneth who suddenly finds herself in the past. A lot of drama ensues and the girl is thrown into a web of old secrets and conspiracies that up to that point have been hidden from her.Considering the fact it only took me about 4 hours to readRuby Redin its entirety, it's safe to say it is a reasonably entertaining and fast-paced novel. The plot is moderately original and well organized, although it is obvious that this trilogy is of a kind whose books don't really have self-contained story arcs but rather are parts of one big story. So don't expect a satisfying temporary conclusion here.I am not sure this series has an appeal to adults, like some middle-grade books do. The conflicts and relationships are fairly juvenile. The concept of time-travel is oversimplified and won't stand up to scrutiny by an adult mind - the real affect of time-travel and and constant contact of people from different eras on the future is never addressed. But for a younger crowd it's not a bad reading choice.Ruby Redoffers a nice mix of PG-rated adventure, mystery, romance and cursory historical details, but nothing more. Tween girls will love the packaging too. Even my ARC is super-pretty, red and bejeweled.
