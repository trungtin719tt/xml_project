"Bleh. Just... bleh. I definitely did NOT enjoy reading this in the eighth grade, nor will I EVER like reading it in the years to come!"That was the review I wrote right after finishing it three years ago from now (2010).After reading it a second time for my junior year, now I can at least understand the text! Schools often make kids read literature that is too mature for their age group, and I have come to find that even a single year's difference can make or break one's comprehension of the book. Now I can say that I appreciate the play for what it is, and I especially admire John Proctor's courage portrayed throughout. He made an awful mistake but had the courage to confess and make a stand against his wrongdoing, even if it resulted in his paying the price for it. That spoke novels to me.It wasn't a favorite read of mine, but Miller's message of self-confession and the precarious state of society were interesting and thought-provoking nevertheless.
