Even though I am older then this experience level I can still read it even though Its a baby book. I will read this book to my nieces and nephew I don't really care about reading a baby book to a "baby". My mom read this book to me when I was little so it is cute for that matter and also cute in the fact when my nieces and nephew grow up I can show how many books I read to them and maybe they will read it to there great-grandchildren,grandchildren, nieces, and nephew so it is cute. It is kinda like a family tradition and it will hopefully keep going. This is my perspective of this book. Still totally love this book.
