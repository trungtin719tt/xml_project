NO!I almost DNF-ed this one. It just irritated me to no end :(But then I met Ash. He deserves the 3 stars here &lt;3You know, sometimes less is more.The Iron Fey universe obviously doesn't know of the concept "less" :(((Up to 40%, the heroine sees about a 150 different creatures, a bit less in the second half but overall she sees a million of them and they're all described like crazy. I know, now you're thinking, Blacky you're a moron or your brain is non-existent for not being able to cope with a hundred million creatures in one book, but let me tell you how it is to read about it.she sees a weird creature. it looks like this and this and does that and that.next page.she sees two creatures that try to kill her and they look like this and this and do that and that.next page.she sees one creature that helps them and he looks like this and this and his house looks like that and thatnext page.she sees a horde of creatures that try to kill hernext page.she sees a weird creature that saves her and it looks like this and thisshe again sees a bunch of creatures that try to kill hernext page.she sees 5 different creatures that look weird and scare hernext page.she gets warned not to go to a dangerous place where the weird creatures live but she STILL goes to the dangerous place and those weird creatures try to kill hernext page......and so, by the time we get to her actually meeting Ash, there is absolutely NOTHING happening in the book except her seeing creatures and those creatures trying to kill her or save her. Seriously, absolutely NOTHING happening.Though, even after she meets Ash, she still gets creatures that try to kill her all over again and some new ones that try to save her.So basically, all the story in this book is the "world building" that was just over extensive because after the 100th creature I met, I didn't give a sh*t about any other and the more she saw the more I wanted to stop reading.Yeah, I have a problem but damn, I just couldn't take it.Another problem here is that she meets Ash at about(view spoiler)[...45(hide spoiler)]%!!!!!!!!!!!Seriously?????????He's the only thing worth reading in the book and the REAL story starts at about 60 % I think, which is a shame and a f*cking waste of reading time as far as I can see, but oh well.The heroine is really, really irritating, she got on my nerves from page one, I don't like the way she thinks, I don't like the way she acts, she's one of those "if I can do anything wrong you bet your ass I'll do it and mess up everything". She made unnecessary deals with just about anyone and that just proved how damn stupid she is.Robin, he is OTT too. I didn't like him, though I probably should but dunno :(He's too funny and too quirky and too everything.So I guess I did a huge rant here ahahhahhhaI can say what I actually LIKED here...The whole concept of the Summer Fay, the Ice Fey and the Iron Feyis really great and has huge potential, if (let's hope) the second book actually has a story for more than 40% it'll be great because (let's hope) we're done with the introduction of the world and it's creatures and it can just move on normally.Ash &lt;3He has silver eyes and is an enemy to Meghan &lt;3I love how the story went after he was introduced in the book, I can't say about it because it would be spoiling, but let's just say that it went from DNF to 3 stars :))))So, I may try the next book because this series DOES look like it has potential to be awesome, and I DID read that they get better and better as it goes along. I hope it's true :)
