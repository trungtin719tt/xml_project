Maybe I'm being slightly harsh with my rating. I read this play and immediately thought I'll rate it 5 stars. But I rescinded this idea. Hear me out. I realized that it was an outdated model of storytelling.I also realized that there's not many adaptations of this story of Shakespeare. We get lots of Romeo and Juliet, Much Ado About Nothing, even the ambitious Othello or Midsummer Night's Dream.The Merchant of Venice is at heart a simplistic story with people in love but it's not a love story. It has a villain, but is not heavily invested in action. It's a living fossil, and I mean that amicably. It's a wondrous fossil. Let's leave it at that.
