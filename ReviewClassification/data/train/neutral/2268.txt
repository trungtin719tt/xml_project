This is your typical boy meets girl story, old as the world. It's a review that I didn't want to write, because what new and incisive thing can I say about such a stale book?The elevation from the main character of Rabbelais is laughable. John Green is a very smart man, but prior to writing his magnum opus, he must have been indigently uninspired.I've read many books throughout these last 5 years but I can tell that the YA market is the most distinctive of all. It's a tricky genre to master. We must realize that the artists who cater to the YA genre, aren't often adolescents.Same as with Saturday morning cartoons. It's adults who create them, not kids. I guess that's the new thing that I wanted to say. That's it from me.
