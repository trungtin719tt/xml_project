People who need to read this? A certain orange someone whose name rhymes with Ronald Rump.There were definitely moments in this that made me yell "OMG YES" at my tablet, because despite being written in the early 1500s, there's a LOT of stuff in this that's still completely relevant to politics today.But there was ALSO a lot in here that was incredibly dry and just kind of boring and that I just didn't really give a shit about. So. I think it's one that's important to read at least once. But I doubt I'll bother rereading this in the future.
