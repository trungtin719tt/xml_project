Ah Cyrano, you of the forever-unbesmirched white plume, you who compromiseth not, you witty boastful holy heathen. You whose facial prominence was unbegotten of lies, as Pinocchio, but by the cruel capriciousness of nature, who was made very much of flesh not wood and whose human heart lay unseen under the shadow of your long disability; you seemed consigned to a certain Pinocchio-like boyhood when you wanted to be a man in full. But, ah fate! Your nose was a beacon signalling unhappiness and you were a paragon of virtue; you, like the Little Tramp inCity Lightsfated to have the truth of your hidden love known much too belatedly in the final reel. You yourself referenceBeauty and the Beastin your mortal throes, but you are a much more sublime hero than that; you dance not off to the heavens with your dearest for the happy ending. Oh no, not you, goodly sir! You are Pagliacci, but you stay your sword as a gentleman would, not like a hot-blooded spurned Latin lover.Where did I first encounter you and your regal proboscis and your equally fulsome wit? I think it was about 30 years ago when I enjoyed Jose Ferrer's Academy Award winning portrayal of you in the sleek, austere 1950 film version. Then in the 1990s you allowed Gerard Depardieu to inhabit you in a far more opulently upholstered French production that seemed the equal of your white plume. It was only then that I realized why Depardieu was considered a fine actor.Edmond Rostand, you probably realized that the life of the real Cyrano de Bergerac was much more interesting and full of complexities than you allow him in this play. But, even so, yours is a sturdy, fast-moving and completely enjoyable classic, filled with tasty wit and admirably unashamed melodramatic romance. I quite liked you very much.And now I lay a wreath at that nose which will smell the fragrances of spring no more.
