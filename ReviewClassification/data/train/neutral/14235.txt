HEY LOOK WHO FINALLY READ THIS. xD Confession: I actually saw the movie first. But I don't remember nearly anything from the movie??? SO I THINK WE'RE GOOD.Anyways, I've been meaning to read this one for a while, and I'm super glad I finally stopped procrastinating it!This was really fun and bouncy and intriguing and I LOVED the storyline. Although it maybe felt just a little creepy for an MG book? Maybe that's just me though. It was an easy read, and fairly fast-paced. The plot was really simplistic and kinda predictable (to be fair, this could just be because I've seen the movie)... but somehow it still worked.The characters were.. ok? They felt really shallow, but thisisMG after all. I wasn't expecting super complex characters. But I would have like for Lina and Doon to have changed over the course of the story. *nods*Also, this was COMPLETELY CLEAN WOOT. Nothingcontent-wisethat would make me feel uncomfortable giving this to anyone 10+. However, that being said, this haddecidedlyhumanistic undertones. I think the author overdid it a little... she pretty much just layered her worldview on over the story. Which isn't necessarily bad, but when your worldview is humanism, then I don't agree with you. xP So I'm thinking this would be better for teens who are more discerning.But, I did enjoy this book for its plot and creative premise. Not sure if I should try the next one though... HELP ME OUT, GUYS. XD
