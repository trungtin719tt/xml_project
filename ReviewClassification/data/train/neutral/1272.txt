At one point I wrote a review for this book. That review was very well written and could have won awards! Sadly, when I went to submit it was one of the times that the Goodreads server crashed and the review was lost for the ages . . . only I will ever remember how truly great that review was!On to a new review that will be much shorter and definitely inferior to the original.This is one of the granddaddies of the YA dystopian genre. Without this book we may not have The Hunger Games, Divergent, Maze Runner, etc.I enjoyed this book . . . and I was frustrated by this book. I believe the fact that I was a new father at the time of reading made the subject matter difficult - I swear you will hug your kids right after finishing this. Twice while reading I threw this book across the room - that is not an exaggeration. I was so shocked by what I read that the book was propelled as far away from me as possible.As an adult this book was hard to read and I cannot imagine reading it as a young adult. If my kids read this when they are teenagers, it is one I will definitely have to talk to them about before and after.I did finish the series, and overall it is very enjoyable - and the other books are not quite as shocking as this one! (at least, none of them were launched!)
