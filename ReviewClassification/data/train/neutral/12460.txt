I read this many years ago, but am rereading with "The Evolution of Science Fiction" group.https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...I remember liking this more back when I first read it in the 70's. I think both the times &amp; my age had a lot to do with that. It never captivated me. Vonnegut made each character a caricature of some ideal of our society &amp; then used that achievement &amp; their flaws to destroy them so that when I didn't actively dislike them, I pitied them. It wasn't subtly done, either. Vonnegut smacked them down with ridiculous, ham-fisted finality &amp; then dragged them into their next moment of truth, only to find out it was really just a lie.It's an absurd morality tale, mildly humorous &amp; immensely sad, that tell us there is no meaning to our lives or civilization. We'd be happiest if we quit trying to pretend there was. The only way to be truly happy is to embrace the situation &amp; love those you're with. Well, that's how I see it, anyway.Vonnegut's writing isn't for everyone. His humor isn't particularly subtle &amp; can be depressing. He writes like a moody drunk which is kind of fun, but gets old after a while. My favorite book by him has always beenWelcome to the Monkey House(which I just downloaded), a collection of short stories. The brevity &amp; focus of a short story suits his style &amp; my appreciation of it far better. I just downloadedArmageddon in Retrospect, a collection of twelve new and unpublished writings on war and peace that was published a year after his death. I'm looking forward to it.
