I am an Outlander series fan. Yes I am. I love Jamie (to an embarrasing extent), Claire and the whole cast of random modern and 18th C. characters that fill the many, many pages of Gabaldon's books. While not fine literature, I can always count on her great storytelling to completely draw me into her world over and over again (to the detriment of my normal life, and my husband's chagrin).That said, while I did enjoy this book there were a number of things about the writing that bothered me:1. The author has another series of books based on a minor character from this series. This is the first time in the Outlander series that I felt lost because I hadn't read the Lord John series. Annoying.2. Because so much time was spent developing this secondary story line, the main characters get the shaft. More than annoying.There were a few other things that annoyed me (too much war/battle details - yawn, THE ENDING WAS CRAZY) but that I think will bother me less upon a second reading.Yes, I read these books multiple times. Did I mention that I love Jamie?
