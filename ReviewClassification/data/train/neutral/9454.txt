At its core,Ishmaelis a narrative about a grand narrative. It aims high, and its failure to achieve what it sets out to do is ultimately more interesting than its stated premise.Ishmael, however, is conscious of this failing--indicated by Quinn's allusion to Plato's cave. But unlike other modern works which use the form of the Grand Narrative to critique or subvert it (the firstMatrixfilm being the most widely recognized example, and many of the short stories of Borges being more notable),Ishmael, in its weaker moments, succumbs to its own overarching prescription. The "Law of Limited Competition," and the thinly veiled suggestion that the book in our hands is the product of the narrator's tutelage under Ishmael are two examples of this. The inattentive reader, then, may find himself wrestling with Ishmael's advice alone, rather than with the text as a whole. "Should we let people starve, rather than stepping up the production of foodstuffs?" and "Is it indicative of Mother Culture's beguiling whispers that we phrase the question in a way that puts us on a level with 'the gods'?" These are, for the most part, the kinds of questions that this book elicits, rather than the more pertinent questions concerning all of what a communicating Gorilla may imply.Ultimately, books likeIshmaeland films likeThe Matrixare concerned with the fundamental epistemological crisis that is part and parcel with self-consciousness: Where did we come from and how can we know? At their best moments, these works also ask, "Why don't any of the narratives feel quite right?"
