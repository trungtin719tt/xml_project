3 Emotionally Unavailable StarsLots of SpoilersI was really looking forward to reading On Dublin Street. There were so many amazing reviews on this book. 5 stars here, there, and everywhere. so I just knew I was going to love this book. Then I read it and I wanted to choke the life out of the heroine Joss. Jocelyn Butler aka Joss just about ruined this book for me with her emotional constipation. Don't get me wrong she had a lot of bad things happen to her. Her parents, little sister and best friend died when she was a teen. So some emotional issues is totally understandable, but damn.Joss came off in this book as a cold bitch. I get she was suppose to be emotionally damaged and have all kinds of walls up. But she ended up coming off with no personality traits. She was so standoffish that I as a reader didn't get to really know her either. Other than the fact that she hurt Braden and Ellie over and over again with her cowardly ways and coldness. She shut herself off from everyone. For 8 years she didn't deal with her loss or anything really. She just lived in a cowardly state of denial. I would have been fine with that. I would have understood and been sympathetic had that crap stopped when she fell in love with Braden. But nope she hurt him over and over. She pushed him away when he needed her the most. She did it so much that I lost all sympathy for her and just wanted to bitch slap her and tell her to get over it already.Braden and Ellie I loved. Braden was sexy and I loved his single minded pursuit of Joss. He wanted her and he wasn't going to take no for an answer. I however didn't get what he seen in her at all. She must have had the magical pussy, because she treated him like shit for almost the whole book. Braden was caveman sexy and had a charm that jumped off the pages. So while I really liked the hero and his sister and I enjoyed parts of this book Joss really brought this read down for me. Although I will say that I didn't hate Joss she just drove me nuts.
