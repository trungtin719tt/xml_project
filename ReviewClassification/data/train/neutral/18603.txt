THIS IS NOT A ROAST!!!!!!NO ONE IS ALLOWED TO HATE, DISOWN, OR OTHERWISE PUNISH ME BECAUSE THIS IS NOT A RANT REVIEW!!!!!!!I'm giving it three stars okay???? So don't be mad. That's not even a bad rating.That being said:- this book was sososososo confusing, for, like, the first 15%, after which it was overwhelmingly obvious but took 300 pages to get to the revelations that had been pret-ty clear in a long term way- STUPID UNNECESSARY ROMANCE THAT I HATE. SO MUCH. BLEH BLEH. Why do people ship this so hard???However there were moments of very pretty writing, and ya gotta admire the badassery of these characters folks.But this book and I just didn't click.Bottom line: I AM SO SORRY I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED NOBODY IS ALLOWED TO HATE ME PLEASE------------IF I DON'T LIKE THIS BOOK I WILL BE DISOWNED BY EVERYONE I LOVE.also i've read the first 10% of this four times. excited to go in for attempt #5anyway PLEASE LET ME LIKE THIS BOOK @READING GODS------------I DON'T KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING.
