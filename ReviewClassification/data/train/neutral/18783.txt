John Steinbeck'sThe Winter of our Discontentis a study of morality in the individual and in the community. Set in a New England town where everyone knows everyone else's business and history, Ethan Hawley narrates his experience with the various moral temptations one season offers him.Under pressure from associates and his own family, Ethan becomes increasingly dissatisfied with his diminished station in life and begins to consider a brief transformation, a temporary suspension of his identity as a humble, upright citizen. Opportunities for bribery, infidelity, robbery, and exploitation knock on his door. Inside, he begins a process of justification, while outside, he carries on as his simple, even silly self. As a result of their corruption, plenty of characters, including a member of Ethan's own family, experience shameful downfalls, while others are able to escape judgment and seamlessly carry on, their lives apparently enhanced by their questionable activities.By providing a narrator who is so obviously a "good guy," but is also human and vulnerable, Steinbeck forces readers to ponder the complex nature of temptation, the role of the conscience, and the power of needs and desires, our own and others'.
