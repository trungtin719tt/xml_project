2.5I wanted to love this book so bad. I really did.Reading this book definitely wasn't easy. So many times i didn't know what the hell was going on. Most of the time I was confused or frustrated, and many times I thought about giving up. If this wasn't a library book, I would definitely put it down, and read it again when I'm in a mood for reading this kind of book.The book is written in 'short stories' form, and I think that was my problem with it. I got bored at beginning of each story, and as soon as things got interesting, the story would end. Only story I enjoyed from start to finish, was Sol's story. I think he and Rachel were the only characters I got attached to. I didn't care what would happen to others.And one of the reasons that I didn't give up reading is that I hoped we would get at least some answers at the end. But nope. It ended on a cliffhanger and not a single answer was given... Did I mention how much I hate cliffhangers? 'Cause I do.For now, I don't think I'll be continuing on with the series. Maybe some time in the future I'll decide to give it a second shot, and hopefully, I'll like it more than I do now.
