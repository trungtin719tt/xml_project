3.5 starsThis sweeping novel takes the reader on a fantastical ride through dimensions and the lives of intriguingly genuine characters.Elegantly told, Barker's larger than life characters enchant and entertain.Imajica is full of adventure, love, lust, power, greed and betrayal.I listened to the audio-book and although getting through the book was an arduous task because of the length, the narrator did an excellent job conveying the characters, inflections, and keeping the story flowing.I would recommend reading a physical copy just for the ease of referencing a previous chapter, reflecting and so on.I did get distracted by the scope of this novel at times.
