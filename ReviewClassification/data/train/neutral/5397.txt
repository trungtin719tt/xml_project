This is the second time recently that I have gone back to revisit a book from my childhood. I think it might be the last. I find that for the most part my distant memories of these books are more pleasing than the reality of reading them at such an advanced age.This book was sweet, but very unrealistic and unsatisfying. The child is too good, the characters too underdeveloped and the miracle too preposterous for my adult tastes. I think I will leave all the other childhood books that beacon my return right where they are and spend my time on all those many books I need to read and cannot find the time for.
