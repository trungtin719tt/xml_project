I liked this book a lot more than I thought I would. I mean, usually when a book is hyped up a lot my immediate reaction is to roll my eyes and wonder if it's worth the hype (I didn't start reading the Harry Potter series until the third one was already out - and then I read them all in one sitting). So, I'm a book-cynic and was worried that I would mind-trash this baby.Ok, first of all -- the most gorgeous cover ever. Provocative, beautiful, and... well, well done Harper Collins. Here's the thing about the writing, I felt like this was a good book. I really enjoyed it, i got caught up on it. I liked the concept a lot... it just felt like it could've used one more polish... if that makes sense?Some of the sections feel disjointed from one another, just in terms of narrative. I absolutely love how the main character avoids the fey, but then suddenly it's a huge about-face that I didn't quite follow with her. I also thought that the relationship between her and the two male characters was interesting but....I wanted to fall more in love with the King and instead.... I dunno. I liked the human boy more. And that colored how I was reading the rest of the book, I wanted her to have to struggle more -- but she didn't, but neither did I?So, here's my rec'd, since I saw a god-awful one in VOYA of this book:I'd buy it. I'd read it. I think this author is only going to get better and better, so I'm looking forward to the next book on your pub-list.But if you have a huge history of reading faery books -- this one might not be your favorite.
