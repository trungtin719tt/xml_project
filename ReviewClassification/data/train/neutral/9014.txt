What to say? Hm....Bared to you centers around Eva Tramell, a twenty four year old woman who is a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. Eva finds it extremely hard at times to overcome this past, but she is drawn to young, billionaire Gideon Cross as soon as she meets him. It is later revealed in the book that Gideon is also a childhood sexual abuse survivor. The two must find a way to heal each other in order to move on from their pasts and establish a healthy romantic relationship.I used to love reading books about hot men who are playboys, but if I'm being honest, it now bores me because this kind of story is being repeated all the time.I've read 'This Man,' 'Up in the Air,' and 'Fifty Shades of Grey,' and most of the concept in these books/series is sex, and I think after reading this book twice, I've had enough of reading erotica. I've actually had enough! Like I want something different for once! Not the same thing being repeated multiple freaking times! (Can you tell I'm frustrated with this!?)In this book, when I saw that a sex scene was coming up, I skipped all the pages and sighed to myself saying, 'Yup, another one.' (Surely I'm not the only one who did this?)And with this series....it's like never ending? I thought after Entwined with you...it was the end but I guess not,but *sigh* I don't know anymore...The men in these series really have a problem, like how many times do you need to get laid...I don't know maybe I'm just not in the mood to read this kind of genre anymore...
