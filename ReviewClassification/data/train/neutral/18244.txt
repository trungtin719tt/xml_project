It's almost a month since I've started reading this book. Usually, I could finish a thick book like this within a week or just several days. However, I got bored in the first part because of the slow pacing of the story; I only got hooked on the story from the second half part till the end.There are at least 4 other books in this series but I'm not sure I will spare time to read them. This first book is like a preview for me if the rest in the series is good or not and I'm a little disappointed with what I've read here.
