This is a great book based on a little, quiet, mediocre family. Oh OK, so it's not a LITTLE family. I don't want to surprise any first-time readers that there are 12 children, but I guess you'll find out soon enough. Well, in that case, it is not about a quiet family, either (since we're talking about 12 children here). And I might as well just tell you right now that it's also not about a mediocre family.Honestly, it was fun book with many moments where I was laughing out loud. I admire the family for being so efficient and systematic, but I know I could never live in such an orderly home. They are so functional that I am bewildered!
