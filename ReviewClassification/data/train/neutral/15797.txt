Naked Lunchis a symphony of smut; a fever-dream of filth; a hallucination; a work of art. This is not a novel that charts an easy course. It is wild, erratic, crude to the extreme, and largely incomprehensible but for occasional moments of clarity. There is genius in these naked pages, a raw and fractured genius, the voice of the depraved and drug-addled, mainlined, unfiltered, directly into the vein. This lunch is opulent, sumptuous, but excessive, tainted, vomit-inducing. Burroughs's masterpiece is certainly an experience, though not a pleasant one.
