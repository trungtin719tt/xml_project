Well. I have conflicting opinions about this book. First, and most obviously, this was almost entirely meant to be a mental vacation after the insanity of planning and executing a wedding in 6 months. In that capacity, "The Valley of the Dolls" shone brilliantly. I was highly entertained by the book and the easy trashiness was somehow comforting, as it always is.But I couldn't help actuallyreadingthe book whilst I was busy regaining balance in my chi or whatever. It's an irritating habit of mine to analyze things that aren't meant to be taken that seriously. On one hand, the whole nacsent feminism thing was interesting. However, in this book there seemed to be a wierd idea that "independence" equals having crappy, unfulfilling relationships with men who advance your career despite the fact you don't care about them, or, are jerks who cheat and lie and refuse commitment, but whom you love enough to overlook the fact. So, while I was entertained by these various unhealthy relationships at times, in the end they were all a bit depressing and I wondered if even the characters were convinced by their actions. Or, maybe they thought everything was dandy and I thought they were idiots. I can't really be sure.Either way, a valuable addition to anyone's beach-reading repetoire.
