Chocolat was good for the sort of fluffy, non-literary sort of book that it is. Vianne, who is a witch of sorts, arrives with her young daughter in a small French town and opens a chocolate shop. Her sensual, outsider ways began to change the lives of the townspeople and invokes the ire of the local priest. This is an enjoyable, light read, but one thing that confused me was when the novel was taking place. I remember reading a part about someone watching videos, but the idea of a priest being upset over people eating chocolate seems so bizarrely anachronistic that I assumed it couldn't be set anywhere near modern times. I suppose they couldn't have made a film if Vianne had come to town to open up a porno shop.
