The writing in this book is beautiful. Ms. Rice can describe a scene with alluring clarity. The story itself is unlike any other I have read in the vampire genre. I will absolutely be continuing with this series, but not right away. Too many reading obligations at the moment. I am looking forward to the next chapter in this story.3.75 stars
