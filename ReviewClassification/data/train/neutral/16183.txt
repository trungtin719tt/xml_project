OK so the most telling thing for me about this book is that it took me OVER A WEEK to read it. It was not a page turner, and I just couldn't get through it any faster. It wasn't a bad book, it just wasn't gripping. At all. Things picked up once Rachel turned into a mink, but that happens halfway through. I found the whole relationship between Ivy and Rachel and all of Rachel's constant angst about Ivy quite tiresome. I kept wanting to shout at the book "make up your mind, trust her or don't trust her, but let's move on!"I might read the next book in the series if I run out of other things to read, because often these things improve as a series progresses. The problem is that I have read SO many great books lately - I have been completely spoiled by Patricia Briggs - that I don't think I'll be returning to The Hollows any time soon. Maybe in a few months I'll feel differently.UPDATE JULY 2017:I feel like I should add an addendum to this review... even though I didn't love book 1, as it turns out, I did read and love the rest of the series. So, it's probably worth reading beyond this first book even if (like me) you didn't enjoy this one all that much.
