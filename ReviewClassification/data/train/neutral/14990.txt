A good epic southern novel. I forgot how much fun it was to read these types of books full of family drama, unrealistic and over-the-top characters, and some good old romance.I remember really enjoying Conroy's Prince of Tides when I read it back as the oldest 10th grader you'll ever know--this book has a similar feel to it. Jack McCall has fled to Rome after his wife commits suicide. He takes his daughter, Leah, with him and vows never to return to the South as there are too many painful memories there for him and his family is bona fide nutso. Throw in the fact that his now dead wife's parents are Holocaust survivors, his best friend from grade school who's now a world-famous hollywood type and just kind of pops up all over the book at random (I guess you assume he's rich enough to do that) wants to make a movie about their young life in South Carolina, another not-so-best friend is running for the S. Carolina Senate and a bunch of crazy brothers and alcoholic fathers--well, I think you have yourself a novel that I'll read. Oh yeah, I can't forget the act of terrorism at the airport, too. Oh jeeze.Wow that was a long winded review that went nowhere. Okay I'm done.
