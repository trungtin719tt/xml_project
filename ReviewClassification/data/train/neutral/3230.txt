Mothers and their daughters, difficult bonds, different generations, different cultures, brought together in this novel.Four Chinese mothers and their four respective daughters tell stories about their lives, their weaknesses, and how they view each other. What is was like to grow up and it's wonderful to appreciate the different perspectives and strong stories that are portrayed.I really wanted to love this book, it just felt choppy. I felt that the stories pulled the story apart, so it read more like a book of short stories (not a fan!) and I had a hard time reminding myself who went with whom. It was difficult to remember that these stories tied together, as most of them felt like they could've been stand alone stories of hardship. There were moments of triumph and moments where I wanted to hug these characters, ultimately, didn't fall as hard as I wanted to.
