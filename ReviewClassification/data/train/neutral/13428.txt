Starship Troopers is a Military Science Fiction classic. It is also a cheesy movie. I watched the movie on Netflix, and then read the book. I'm happy to report that the book is much, much better than the movie.The story follows Rico, a generic soldier in the Terran Infantry in the lead up to and the full fledged explosion of war against the alien "bug" species. The aliens are kind of like ants in that there is a Queen and a vast army or soldier and worker bugs dedicated to a specific role. These roles do not think beyond fulfilling their obligation to the collective. The story is in many ways the story of this alien species clashing with the frenetic, individualistic humanity.Very cool little story. Kind of generic, but fun. Additionally, the author definitely injects a firm libertarian bent into the story. It's OK, I guess, but I generally want to avoid books with too firm of a message. Except for Animal Farm. That book is fun.
