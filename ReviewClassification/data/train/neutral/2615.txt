The Role (bibli)call:The big cuddly cat = Jesus. Strange that a lion should be chosen to represent the big man when Lions are notoriously aggressive, solitary carnivores who are more likely to eat any potential apostles than than teach or lead them.The white witch = Satan or Eve the temptress depending on which side of the tree of knowledge you're most likely to be barking up. Famed for a monochrome wardrobe in the A/W line only. Like Alan Rickman in Robin Hood: Prince of Thieves, she has cancelled Christmas.Edmund = Judas Iscariot. Judas has been proven to be a more astute bargain maker and walks off with 30 pieces of silver for his denials. Edmund gets a box of sweets.Lucy, Peter, Susan = apostles, knights and other positive biblical forces. An unusual scenario given the general hoo-hah about whether or not any of apostles were female (see last supper male/female image debate).Mr Tumnus the faun = an aberration. With his goat like legs and general caprine features you might be forgiven for imagining that he might be an agent of Satan, or Pan or some other pagan deity. Nope. He's on the side of good and not evil and that there throws the nice set of biblical allusions into chaos.Beavers, birds, satyrs, fauns and other ancillary creatures = collateral damage.Plot summary: Icing sugar, picture perfect winter wonderland accessible through the rear of roomy wardrobe handily equipped with high-end (but non PETA approved) all weather garb. Ruled in supremely effective manner by single minded, highly organised, independent woman until arrival of children and large pet. Maybe this book is actually a metaphor for home life in the modern age.
