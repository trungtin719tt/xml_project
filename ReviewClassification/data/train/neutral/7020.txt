Kurt Vonnegut famously graded all of his books. He gaveBreakfast of Championsa C, and probably it deserves it.Although there's plenty to appreciate in terms of wit and humor, and although there's a few genius scenes, as a whole this satire doesn't compare withCat's Cradle,Slaughterhouse Five, orThe Sirens of Titan. Where those books excel in clarity and being easy to follow, this one fails in a disorganized, meandering mess.As with everything Vonnegut wrote, reading it feels more like experiencing an art piece than just a story, but the picture at the end is sort of a wreck like one of Pollock's paintings.
