Book Review(This pic is from deviantart.com btw)I've been wanting to read this series for a long time now but unfortunately I was always got sidetracked by other vampire series(e.g. The Black Dagger Brotherhood series, Vampire Academy, House of Night, Evernight Series, Morganville Vampires, Sookie Stackhouse series, The Mortal Instruments Trilogy, Night Huntress).Whoa that was a long list, should I just say I'm a vampire addict?(blame this on Meyer's Twilight).Okay so yeah I picked it up due to these reasons:1. My friends Szam, Julie, Gabby and Isamlq (etc. in case I forgot someone) always talked about the series that I felt left out and out of place, so might as well read this so that I can join in their bubble of conversation.2. It has vampires in it, 'nuff said.3. It was actually authored by a Filipina-American author(I'm a Filipina too btw), so yeah cool beans, should definitely read this to show some Filipino love.So now will gonna have pros and cons...Pros1. Vampires (check)2. Filipina Author (check)3. A heroine that is not whiny, weak, Mary Sue, and stupid (*coughs*shall I just put Bella Swan here*coughs*) (check)4. Hot guys (check)5. Cool vampire lore (check)6. Fashion (check)7. Vampires and shool life (check)8. Teen drama (check)9. Love triangle (check)10. A surprise that I didn't see coming (check)11. Writing is not crappy *coughs*House of Night, Fallen, Twilight, and Sookie Stackhouse*coughs*(check)12. Lovable and quirky characters *my faves were Dylan and Bliss and I'm Team Ollie btw* (check)13. Sexy (check)Okay what I found original in this one:1. The idea that vampires came from fallen angels.2. The blue bloods, silver bloods and red bloods.3. The repository thingy.4. The stages of vampire life thingy.5. The conduits.6. The Sacred Kiss thingy.Cons1. Similarities (euphemism for rip-off) with other books:&gt;House of Night-also use the term vampyre-the queen bee thingy-Zoey and Sky has lots of common like they have this prophecy thingy about saving the vampyres blah blah blah-Bliss and Dylan's relationship reminds me of Rephaim and Stevie Rae&gt;Gossip Girl-mention of brands-parties, clubs, smoking, modeling etc.-Manhattan Elites (even the place- East Side)-the popular and non-popular group-the sex&gt;City of Bones-Ollie reminds me of Simon-Allegra reminds me of Clary's mom (both were in coma and have the famous position on their race)-Incest (Jack and Mimi)&gt;Evernight-the mix of vampires and humans in one academy-the mention that they're vampires also happen in the middle of the plot&gt;Fallen and Evermore-At first I thought that Jack and Sky's relationship was similar with Luce and Daniel and Ever and Damen relationships but I was wrong and I didn't see it coming that tuuuuuuut was what Jack old mate(can I say mate? idk maybe lover?)(extra)Favorite Scene:&gt;my favorite scene was the interrupted sacred kiss(and sex)between Dylan and Bliss and I was like thisbut then Bliss' father cameYeah I like it and will still read the next books ^^___________________________________________________________I think it's time for me to read a Vampire story told by a Filipina author &gt;.&lt;
