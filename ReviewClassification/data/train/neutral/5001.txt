I liked Speak. For the most part.Mostly the end.The majority of the book was pretty bland. I had a voice in my head pestering me and saying; "Oh my god, who the fuck cares?!"Thankfully, it paid off in the end. The ending really made the book for me.Though I wish Melinda had given Andy (aka IT) a good kick in the balls.Indeed.www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaXd2AmWtPI&amp;a...I'm sorry, I'm having WAY too much fun with this!But when you watch it, it's actually quite close to a situation in the book. (When Melinda sees IT for the first time in the hallway, this is what she should have done.)Melinda (witch girl): "It's you! (IT)"Andy Evans (Black Star): "Yeah, it is me! The one and only Andy Ev-"*KICK*Melinda: "Gotcha right in the balls!" :DOkay, I'm done now.
