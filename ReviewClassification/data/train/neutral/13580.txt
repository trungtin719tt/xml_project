In the words of Captain Nemo. "You won't regret the time you spend aboard my vessel. You are going to voyage through a land of wonders. Stunned amazement will probably be your state of mind." That is exactly how I felt while reading this story. The descriptions of the Nautilus were beautiful. It had a gorgeous state of the art library. Panels that would open and you can watch the ocean. Why would you want to leave? Once aboard the Nautilus, you were basically a prisoner, leaving was not an option. Professor Aronnax and his crew got homesick, started making escape plans.I wanted to read this and find out more about Captain Nemo. I have seen too many animated versions. I was surprised that Captain Nemo was not always a nice character, some call him a villain. He was at times, then he would be kindhearted, then sad. I give him credit for building a submarine that used seawater for electricity. He lived off what the ocean gave.I do have some criticism, this book bogs down. It reads like a marine biology textbook. You get lengthy descriptions of fish, mollusks and crustaceans. Some parts of the story have gruesome violence. Captain Nemo was ruthless, if attacked.I got a little bored, I wanted more action. Action and fear were introduced, but it never goes anywhere. I would recommend it, because it is a fascinating under sea adventure. I gave it three stars because of the abrupt ending. It leaves you with more questions than answers. Captain Nemo still remains a mystery. Left up to your imagination.
