Arthur Miller's scathing indictment of 50's era McCarthyism was more interesting than I thought it would be.Miller set the piece in Salem, MA during the infamous 1692 witch trials.The play itself is divided into four acts and features the struggles individual villagers face as they are confronted with a hellish choice between hanging for witchcraft or falsely confessing, a choice which leads to the death of others.The action is driven by a posse of teenage girls. In order to escape punishment for dancing in the woods (a verboten activity for Puritans) the girls begin accusing community members of bewitching them. Their fever catches on and burns up the entire village as reason, justice, and mercy are swept away in the raging tide of repression, revenge, and corruption.The play makes the adjective puritannical take on a whole new meaning.
