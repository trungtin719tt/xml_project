3.5 StarsI feel like this book started off the Science fiction era, and created an enormous number of novels to follow.The Time Machineis about a young scientist who discovers the ability to travel across time with his own invention. Don't ask me the details of how it is possible, I am not a physicist. I am a Biologist. The Time Traveller speaks about his adventure to a group of men, who either believe he did in fact travel through Earth's lifetime or not.I found the topic very interesting, and time traveling is top of my list of things to. My husband tells me it cannot happen, but he thinks there are a possibility of alternate universes. (How would he know anyways, he is a program engineer.) Well, damn my dreams to go back to Scotland in the 1700s. It wasn't just time traveling that interested me, but the scientific thoughts of Earth, how he explained how our universe is expanding by referring to the stars, and other chemical, and biological process that happen during the world at certain points. I am actually interested in H.G. Wells scientific thoughts, and would gladly read them.The Time Machineis a short book; my audio was only 3 hours long. His world building was oddly familiar.(view spoiler)[The story reminded me of a cross between any time traveling movie,Utopia, and I am Legend. A few things didn't come as a shock to me, since I have seen them before.(hide spoiler)]I did like his writing style, and I will read another one of his novels in the future, unless I figure out a way to time travel.John Banks had a beauitful voice to listen to. There were only a few other characters, but majority of the time the Time Traveller spoke, so there was no need to change inflections. I think his voice was appropriate for the piece.The Time Machineis about a young scientist adventure through time. Happy reading!
