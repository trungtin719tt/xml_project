This book is perfect blend of Twilight and Wicked Lovely. Supernatural, dark, romance new girl at school thing going on. The main character is a bit more together (she is really into running, and human rights aka Amnesty International) then Bella from Twilight. Set in Maine (atmospheric). It is not the best written book in the world and a little formulaic at this point BUT your teens will love it and not that many folks know about it yet. I found the story was creepy and fast paced enough to keep my interest.One good thing to note! There is a character with a physical disability (in a wheel chair) who is portrayed as both a hotty, and a strong member of the group in terms with being part of the plan and researching the plan. It is rare that I meet a character in a wheelchair integrated quite so well.
