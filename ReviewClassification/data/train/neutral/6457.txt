Actual rating, 3.5 stars.This is a perfectly whimsical read and, had my younger self read this, then I could see this becoming a firm childhood favourite. As it is, I feel I am too old to really appreciate the fantastic and yet simplistic story. It saddens me to say this, really. It means that my more mature self has picked plot holes and problems where only beauty and simplicity should reign. This is living proof that growing up is definitely bad for you!The story was poignant, whimsical and sweet and exactly what I was expecting. The descriptions the novel opened with transported me into the world and I found this wonderfully eloquent for a book aimed at a younger audience. I also fell in love with the characters. Our protagonist, Winnie, and the entire Tuck family feel warm and welcoming to the reader and I felt a fuzzy feeling inside whilst reading this!My problems with the novel were really only minor inconsistencies, and yet they jarred with my understanding and enjoyment of the novel. There were many coincidences and plot holes and, again, this is something that probably would not bother or even be picked up on by the audience it was aimed for. I also felt like the age difference between Winnie and Jesse was wrong on so many levels...In all, this is a very sweet and simplistic tale and I am only sorry that I had not read it when I was younger, to truly appreciate the brilliance of the story.
