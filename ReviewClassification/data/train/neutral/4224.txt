Lavishly described meandering adventures of the mild nature.The Wind in the Willowshas an intrinsically English flavor. The characters are happy to live their ordinary lives with only a hint of interest in the wider world. Too strong of an adventurous spiritedness is considered uncouth. Such hearty frivolity as Toad's is frowned upon to the utmost!Unfortunately this goes for the author, too. Kenneth Grahame's plots are not terribly gripping due to their lack of depth. He seems pleased rather to spend the time describing a pleasant boating holiday down the river. If it wasn't for the scenes with the Wonderful Toad, the Fantastic Toad there would be very little excitement indeed.However, it is the bond of friendship and the love of homely pleasures that entices us to read on. I gave it 3 stars, because I likedThe Wind in the Willows. No more and no less, and let's keep it as nice and cozily close to uncontroversial as that, shall we?
