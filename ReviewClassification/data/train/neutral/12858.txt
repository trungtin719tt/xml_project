Nice book on struggling with intercultural identities.I stare and stare at that sentence. I can't believe that is all I have to say about this novel. After all, this is MY topic. This is my life. My profession. My passion. How do people fit into a dominant culture if their parents come from somewhere else? Which customs do they pick from which environment, and how do they adapt to form a crosscultural identity that works for them? How is their language affected by constant switching? Where - if at all - do they feel at home? Do they have benefits from living between two worlds, or is it a loss? All those things are contained in this Pulitzer-winning author's novel, and yet...All I can say is: "It's nice."And when I taught language at an international school, I used to tell students struggling with synonyms to avoid repetitive use of common adjectives:"Nice is not a nice word. Find something more glorious!"
