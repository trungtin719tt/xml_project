"Because growing up means making tough choices, and doing the right thing doesn't necessarily mean doing the thing that feels good."*****You know it's a good book when you'll never look at certain things the same way. This book was such an unexpectedly good read. I picked it up thinking it was like any cheesy romance book out there. Boy, I was wrong.Now, I never had to deal with any of the problems that the main characters had to, nor do I know people in real life who had. But I do know that the author dealt with these problems quite realistically. It was really hard sometimes to read because of all the mess going on. My heart would be teared into pieces just reading certain chapters.I teared up a couple of times, but I also smiled widely many times; especially at the end.I love it when characters grow.Not to mention, this book does send out some really great messages, but I like feel mentioning them would be a spoiler. Besides, not everyone get the same experience reading the same book. You'll probably latch on specific things that will stand out to you.Why one star off? Well, I wanted a different kind of romance in this book, one that suited the tone of it. It felt off sometimes.But don't take that as a con. Honestly, just ignore the romance and focus on the other things that this book gives you.
