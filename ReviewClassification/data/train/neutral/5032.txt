King Lear is the first Shakespearean tragedy I read. I have had an aversion for Shakespearean tragedies after watching a performance of Julius Caesar long ago as a child. Hence this long I have been avoiding Shakespearean tragedies. But since joining goodreads, I have had a mind of reading more Shakespearean plays; so I picked up on King Lear.King Lear is a tragic story of a king who fails to understand between honesty and deception and truthfulness and flattery.(view spoiler)[Lear being charmed by the flattery of his elder two daughters Goneril and Regan, and angered by his youngest daughter Cordelia's truthfulness, decides to divide his kingdom between the elder two daughters, renouncing the youngest. He soon finds out that he had become a victim of deception and that his elder daughters do not care an ounce about him. He mourns for Cordelia. Cordelia who comes back home on hearing her father's position becomes a victim of a conspiracy along side with the Lear.(hide spoiler)]Secondary to this tragic tale, there is a tale of lust, rivalry between sisters, deception, and treachery of wives of their husbands. This is the first time I encountered such villainous and wicked women in a Shakespearean play and in royal blood too!I have had my doubts as to how I would respond to the Shakespearean tragedies, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I could enjoy them too. The ending here was vague and a little too dark for my taste, nevertheless I liked the tale. Now that I have overcome my anxiety, I will pick more of his tragedies in the future.
