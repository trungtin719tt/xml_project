3 stars !....This book had moments of perfection in its poetic prose (5 star quality) to sections of the most horrible chick-lit (1.5 star quality).The narrative of the Congo was fascinating both historically and anthropologically. At times I felt connected to the collective unconscious.(view spoiler)[ The hunt scene as well as the death of Ruth May come to mind as examples of this.(hide spoiler)]The individual voices of the Price girls and even less so the Price women (when they grew up)did not ring true and I feel strongly that this book would have been much more powerful written in the third person.I am perplexed that a book that at times reached the pinnacle of literary wonder could rapidly deteriorate to trite vacuous melodrama.I am certainly glad that I finally read this novel and am open to trying another novel by this author as when it was good it soared.
