While this is sci-fi, it also seems semi-autobiographical. Robert Heinlein was in the Navy and it appears this novel is based on his experiences. He takes us through boot camp, gives a rundown of his invented space corps and finishes up with a short battle with overgrown bugs. Overall it feels like an introductory to a series or little more than an outline, as if Heinlein wanted a walk down memory lane in book form. In fact, if this is any indication, he was very fond of his time in the services. Critics have called this military propaganda. Since he was writing through the voice of an unreliable narrator, I'll leave that topic to others to fight over and limit my criticism to the lack of action. There's just too much lead up to a whole lotta not much. In other words, in a novel about soldiers learning how to fight, there should be more fighting.
