I have been told and told again how important and crucial it is that I read this book. Well now I have and here's my review. It is widely considered a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, after having read this I find myself on the opposing spectrum. Yes, some things that were included in this novel are similar to the societal change that we have been experiencing. Nevertheless, I struggle to wrap my head around the idea that this is truly the direction our civilization is heading towards. This book is what I would call a dystopic science fiction book. The society that is depicted in this novel is considered to be a utopia. The keyword here is considered. It is, in fact, more of a nightmarish depiction of what Aldous Huxley believes the future of humankind is going to look like. Is it perfect? No. This society only offers one kind of freedom: sexual freedom and that is the only reason why it is successful! If it did not have this freedom it would not have lasted for all those centuries. One might be perfectly fine with having only one type of freedom but it is hard to imagine our current society morphing into a society that is so limiting and technologically advanced. All in all, I liked the book but thought that Brave New World Revisited was a waste of my time. I felt like the author's perspective on the world had narcissistic undertones which made it a bitter read apart from when I was in the mood. The names of the characters were clearly inspired by Marx and Lenin. Him explaining the reason behind that would have been more interesting than reading about useless commentaries and lessons on how the world works. The whole thing about the savage reservation and the savage was disturbing and gruesome to read about. The ending was bitter and did not make me want to read this book ever again. The writing was academic but at time very addicting.
