Would recommend if you like post apocalyptic stories!Likes:-I love survival stories in general, and this fulfilled that.-A very realistic feeling apocalyptic event.-I loved that this showed the very beginning of the crisis and how survivors dealt with drastic changes.-The diary entry format suited this story and gave a personal touch.-I liked that the ending actually touched on a broad scale solution.Dislikes:-The writing was very simplistic.-Insensitive wording concerning mental health and disability.-A handful of scenes contain fat shaming.Audio Review: 2 starsNarrated by Emily Bauer. She had to grow on me. I was warned that the narrator made the character sound immature, but I think that is actually due to the writing. (And keep in mind that the character is 15.) As for voicing... she didn't even try. All characters sounded the same.tw: death, starvation, hanging, MC makes flippant suicidal statements.
