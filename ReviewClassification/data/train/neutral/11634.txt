Strangely Disturbing Novel, Many Possible InterpretationsThis novel is particularly tough to review. It's even tough to rate. I'm very ambivalent about this book. It was interesting, but also frustrating.The Maguscertainly won't be suitable for people who have Twitter-induced Attention Deficit Disorder and must have quick action and a fast pace.The book's pace is majestically slow, and it takes quite awhile for anything to happen.It's wordy, too.In short, it's an old-fashioned novel and it's a bit dated.It's also subject to multiple interpretations.John Fowlesseems to have deliberately left a lot of things (including the ending) ambiguous.It's also tough to discuss the story without giving away spoilers.I think a lot of the book is about young men's inability to love.Nicholas Urfe is a handsome, confused, and directionless young Brit in 1953 post-war England. He's a bit of an intellectual and dabbles in poetry. He seduces lots of women for his amusement and then drops them. He's a bit of a cad. After quitting a teaching job in England, he accepts another job teaching at a school for boys on the remote Greek island of Phraxos.Before he leaves for Phraxos, he meets an Australian girl, Alison Kelly. They begin a relationship. When Nicholas leaves for Phraxos, Alison starts a job as an "air hostess" (airline stewardess). They leave things uncommital and open-ended.On Phraxos, Nicholas becomes infatuated with the beautiful Lily Montgomery (a.k.a. Julie). He also meets Maurice Conchis, the cultivated and very rich owner of a villa called Bourani.Strange things happen on Phraxos. I can't say much more about those happenings without spoiling the story, except that they involve weird rituals and mind games.(view spoiler)[Conchis is "The Magus" of the title, and he presides over some bizarre ceremonies, some of which seem almost Satanic. Nicholas goes through a mock "trial" and it's not clear whether the purpose of that trial is simply to humiliate him or to educate him. In either case, Nicholas is abducted, coerced, and abused.(hide spoiler)]Nicholas does learn about the nature of love, how love and sex are different, etc. But it's not clear that Nicholas matures into a loving adult. He keeps demonstrating his inability to give and receive love. In fact, in situations where he should be kind, he is often just brutal. He continues to blame women for his own failures instead of facing them. He is honest with himself, but still he fails to become worthy of love.Fowles ties in stories of German atrocities on Phraxos during World War II, as if to demonstrate that the inability of young men to love leads to the atrocities of war.When Nicholas returns to London he does some detective work to try to make sense of the events on Phraxos.The novel's ending is particularly ambiguous.(view spoiler)[I thought it was a tragic ending, and it was likely that Alison would never forgive Nicholas's transgressions and never speak to him again. But that's not entirely clear.(hide spoiler)]The novel was probably sensational at the time it was published (1966) for both its sexually explicit content and the descriptions of the weird events on Phraxos. However, a lot of that seems dated now.I think the book suffers from a lack of direction and purpose. It often seems as if Fowles is sort of blundering along without a clear goal in mind. He almost admits as much in his preface,"I had no coherent idea at all of where I was going, in life as in the book."And"I have not attempted to answer the many justified criticisms of excess, over-complexity, artificiality and the rest that the book received from the more sternly adult reviewers on its first appearance...it must always substantially remain a novel of adolescence written by a retarded adolescent."Nicholas Boulton is a competent audio reader. However, the text I followed in 3M Cloud, Fowles' 1976 revised version, was substantially different than the audio. So the audio appeared to be a different version (the original version? a newer revision? Who knows?). Strange, since the audio came out in 2012, which obviously long after the 1976 revision was published.
