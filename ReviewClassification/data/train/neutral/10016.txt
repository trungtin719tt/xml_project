OMFG IT FINALLY HAS A COVER!!!!First off I must say that that is a stunning dress! Hmm which dress would you say is better?Oh gosh, I can't choose! There both so pretty! Although I do like the red colour more.Now on to the real thing I want to talk about. I'm so freaking excited for this book! I really loved the first one, in fact I loved it so much that I read it while I was at an amusement park. In fact I was so sucked in that I started reading it in the line-ups and I kept wanting to read it even while I was on the rides. I couldn't concentrate on anything until I finished and luckily I already read most of it at home so there wasn't that much to go.I'm looking forward to seeing what happens with that awkward love triangle and hopefully more plot twists. Also with the contestants narrowed down so much there's probably going to be a lot more... hmm, how should I put this... bitchiness. There, that's a good word... kind of; I also could have gone with competition but meh. And you know what, I'm not really sure what to expect besides the competition and love triangle in terms of plot but hey that's just one more thing to look forward to.But now I have to wait patiently like a good little girl for this to come out.check my blog if you want:Story Envy
