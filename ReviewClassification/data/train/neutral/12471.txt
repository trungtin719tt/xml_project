I feel guilty rating this book because I kid you not, I just BARELY absorbed anything in this book. I listened to it on audio, and I was maybe only attentive for 50% of that experience. It doesn't help that my professor gets so off track during class that we never actually discuss what we've read, so I don't have any incentive to read what we've been assigned. This series is definitely something I want to revisit in the future when I'm not skim-reading it out of a 10-pound series bindup and I don't have to read the entire series in 4 weeks. I love Frodo and Sam and Gollum. So much. I wanted to love this, but reading it was unbearable because of the size and page requirements, so hopefully when I reread this one day from the box set I already own, I will enjoy it and see its merit enough to rate it higher.
