I read this at last night's Christmas party my friends brought me to. This book was on the coffee table so I picked it up. It contains a good message with a noticeably Christian undertone (puppetmaker as a fatherly God figure).What you take from this book really depends on your spiritual outlook though. As someone who leans towards sufism, yoga, and meditation, the lesson I took from the story is that happiness and contentment comes from looking inward and not from external validation.
