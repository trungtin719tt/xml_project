I'm sorry to say it, I just wasn't impressed.I picked up this audiobook for free on World Book Day provided by Amazon. While it wasn't all bad, it hasn't been my favorite audiobook. I must say, I strongly disliked the music, I really just didn't see the point in it. It was extremely irritating to me. As for the narration, Peter Dennis did fairly well with representing the characters we all know and love. The only one I didn't feel was represented well was Christopher Robin, he just seemed to come across as too adult. I did enjoy his representation of Pooh, and especially Piglet.As for the novel and stories in itself, I'm starting to recall why I wasn't exactly a huge Winnie the Pooh fan growing up. I was always a take it or leave it kind of child when it came to Winnie the Pooh. It just never seemed all that captivating to me. I was a very imaginative child, and for me, there was never enough adventure. That aside, the characters are endearing, and I can see why this is a favorite for many.
