What a silly novel! Much of these unfortunate destinies could have been prevented if only the characters weren't so stupid and didn't make so many irrational and unbelievable decisions.But what an entertaining story this is! It's got a shocking beginning and a lot of plot twists that I didn't see coming, I just wish that it didn't feel like Thomas Hardy was pushing the plot forward in an unnatural and quite unbelievable way.I won't go too much into the plot and the characters' decisions which I disagree with because I want for you to be surprised when you read it. I will say, though, that this is quite an entertaining book, however in my eyes not the strongest work of Hardy's.
