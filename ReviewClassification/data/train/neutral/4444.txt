This needed to happen.On the Roadneeded to happen. Burroughs, Kesey, Ginsberg, etc needed to happen. But is it good literature? For its time, yes. For all time? The jury's out. CertainlyFear and Loathing in Las Vegasis good comedy, but it may also be bad everything else.Is this wisdom? Is it pure nonsense? Is it intelligent? Perhaps when it's occasionally intelligible. There are flashes of philosophy and poeticism...stoner philosophy and beat poeticism. Good for their day, necessary even, but dated and -like a new car driven off the lot- losing its value day by day.This is the first thing of his I've read, so I don't know Hunter S. Thompson from a hole in the wall. I plan to read his other books and I should seek out his Sports Illustrated and Rolling Stone articles before I cast judgement, but if this is his crowning glory, I can't help but lump him into that category of '60s drug-addled mind drifters, those wastes of talent who spout some scattered lines of faux guru shit that impresses other strung out jellyheads in between bouts of frying up their brains. When genius-level IQ luminaries of the day (E.G. Jim Morrison) weren't getting wasted, they picked up a single random and usually obscure book and it blew their mind...so they constantly referred to it in their own writing repeatedly like a mantra (In Thompson's case: see Horatio Algers). Beyond that they were too busy destroying their minds to be bothered with improving them. I suppose someone had to do it. I just wish I hadn't wasted a moment of my life idolizing such pseudo philosophers. Ah, but the young, innocent and flat out stupid will be fooled by the simplest of messiahs.
