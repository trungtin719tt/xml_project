"But generally the spearis prompt to retaliate when a prince is killed,no matter how admirable the bride may be."I'm astounded by thecomplexityof this poem. It makes me wish my Germanic philology course lasted forever so we could analyse it word by word, slowly, meticulously, languidly. This is why I personally suggest reading it with the help of a critical guide if you haven't the faintest idea what it tells about, when it was written and what it seeks to portrait, of the debate about it being Christian or not, etc.If you're willing to do some research by yourself, I promise you're in for a treat.
