THE BEST BOOK I'VE READ ALL YEAR!"He was the crazy onewho had painted himself blackand defeated the world.""She was the book thiefwithout the words."Was that really necessary?! I cheated, i got impatient and decided to watch the movie in the middle of the book. I was still not prepared. The book will hit you like nothing else. Maybe i'll write a full review over the weekend if i could stop crying.It's just a small story really, about, among other things:*A girl*Some words*An accordionist*Some fanatical Germans*A Jewish fist fighter*And quite a lot of thieveryI can read pretty much anything, no matter how brutal: the darker the better.But for some reason i am very sensitive to this particular subject (war).Feeling fearful and thrilled at the same time.Can i just say how much i love our narrator?!How cool is it that death itself is telling the story, and feeling sorry for this little girl?#shamelesscrying."Please, again, i ask you to believe me.I wanted to stop. To crouch down.I wanted to say"I'm sorry, child."But that is not allowed. I did not speak.Instead, i watched her awhile.When she was able to move, i followed her."
