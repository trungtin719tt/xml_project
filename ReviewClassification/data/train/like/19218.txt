I found this last night, which I scribbled down about 8 years ago when I first read this. I will let it stand as is:*******************I am reading a new translation of 'The Book of Disquiet' by Fernando Pessoa. These fragments shoved in a trunk speak in a voice so close to my own, secret, internal wanderings that I feel like a shadow slowly recognising the body it follows. This is not to suggest I am anything near his genius but simply that he writes what I remember feeling, or I remember feeling their rough, uncertain edges at my few precious moments of precision..."We generally give to our ideas about the unknown the color of our notions about what we do know: If we call death a sleep it's because it has the appearance of sleep; if we call death a new life, it's because it seems different from life. We build our beliefs and hopes out of these small misunderstandings with reality and live off husks of bread we call cakes, the way poor children play at being happy.But that's how all life is; at least that's how the particular way of life generally known as civilization is. Civilization consists in giving an inappropriate name to something and then dreaming what results from that. And in fact the false name and the true dream do create a new reality. The object really does become other, because we have made it so. We manufacture realities. We use the raw materials we always used but the form lent it by art effectively prevents it from remaining the same. A table made out of pinewood is a pinetree but it is also a table. We sit down at the table not at the pinetree. ..."This reminds me of Heidegger's comment that when we sit at our table to eat we are not sitting at 'A' table, but 'The' (or 'This') table - it is burdened with memories and language (although some would say they are the same thing) and that the Being of my table is something only I can give it. I used to think a lot about how 'The' Universe existed only for, and in, me...There is, of course, something that is 'The Universe' and will run me over if I cross the road without looking, but the only one I can 'Know' or 'Experience' is the one created within me by my brain. Which means my universe, and my table, are unique and that my death will be their death too...I am truly a destroyer (and a creator) of worlds..*********************I find it funny I was having the same rambling Heidegger thoughts then as I just had on my review of McElroy's Ancient History. Apparently my brain is just going round and round in circles...I also now take something a little different from the quote - much more about the way language and naming operate to prevent "open" interactions with Things.
