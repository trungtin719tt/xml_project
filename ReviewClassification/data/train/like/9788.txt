"Sometimes dead is better".................KINGcallsPet Semataryhis scariest book, and I can understand why. It is super creepy and super "shocking" where he takes the reader, and his interesting prologue explaining how he came to write this unsettling tale brings a bit of truth to the story.While truly a horror of a read, it is excellent in respect to its genre, but justawfultoo if that makes any sense. PS is not particularly gory, but definitely sad, sick, dark, and disgusting with more than one horribly "shocking" event that will blow your mind.Take heed if you're new to reading horror as this one will make your skin crawl and keep you from taking a walk in the woods anytime soon......especially if your cat is nearby."IT"is still my favorite scaryKINGthriller(especially the "old" movie)butPet Sematary(did I say it was "shocking")is a close second, and......."sometimes deadisbetter."UPDATE: October 16, 2015WARNING: DO NOT WATCH THE MOVIE UNLESS YOU WANT TO BE TOTALLY CREEPED OUT! THE VISUAL OF THE "SISTER" FLASHBACK SCENE ALONE IS MORE HORRIFYING THAN THE ENTIRE BOOK!!!
