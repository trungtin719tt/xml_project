The first time I read The Shining was in High School, it was the second Stephen King novel I read. I loved it, I loved the creepy horror aspects of the book and I liked the book much more than I liked the movie. As I continued my Stephen King binge I decided to go back and reread this classic. As an adult I still loved this book but for a different reason. This go around it was the non supernatural aspects that appealed to me most.Jack Torrance our villain was already barely hanging on to his sobriety and sanity before this book even began. The Overlook Hotel didn't make him crazy, it just gave him the final push. Jack would have snapped anyway. Jack was an unemployed recovering alcoholic with a nasty temper. The Overlook just brought out the monster hidden inside him. Stephen King is at his best when he uses real life horror with supernatural horror. Chances are you will never see a ghost or spend a night in a Hotel like The Overlook but people like Jack Torrance really exist. In the news right now is a story about a man who murdered his pregnant wife and 2 small children. I highly doubt a supernatural force made him do it.The Shining is an All- Time classic and it deserves all the hype it gets. If you've never read a King novel The Shining is a good place to start.Hooked On Books August Read-A-Thon2018 Badass Books Reading Challenge: An award winning book
