I am impatiently anticipating the exciting moment when I can read this book aloud to my daughter. One of my favorites of the many Golden Books that I cherished as a kid, "The Monster at the End of this Book" by Jon Stone is a perfect, fun little story that taught me the joys of suspense and patience, as my mother used to gleefully take her time turning the pages, while I wiggled with joyous excitement until the last page which, of course (***spoiler alert!***), revealed that the monster was none other than cute, lovable Grover! Having your first kid is a nerve-wracking and exciting time, but it's also a wonderful time to revisit some of your own fond memories of childhood. Not surprisingly, most of mine involved books. So, indulge me if you will while I wax nostalgic in the next couple months until the birth of my little girl, as I will probably be posting several reviews of some of my favorite children's book classics.
