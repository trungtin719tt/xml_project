--Well, this is not a review but these posts are so hilarious, I couldn't resist. ^___^---------------------------------------------------------------MY SAD OLD REVIEW.-To be honest I didn't read this series until now because of the hideous cover as the guy on the cover looks like someone in a Turkish soap. But yesterday when I didn't had anything to read at all and the only choice I had was either this or some weepy sappy romance novel by Nicholas Sparks,I thought why not.-BUT what I didn't know was that i was going to fall in love again...after a very long time.*sigh*The second reason it was untouched until now was the name Daemon since I have major issues with THE DAMON from Vampire Diaries. BUT Daemon was a jerkface(as Katy points out about a million times) but still AWEsome(as he points out a hundred million times),but that whats makes him so.....I can't even find the right words.I had flashbacks of twilight but who cares. Not me obviously. ^____^
