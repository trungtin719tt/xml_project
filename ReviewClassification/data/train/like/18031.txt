I don't even know where to start this review. I am typing it through teary eyes, so I will keep it simple. (Insert tissues here)My pick for Vianne when this becomes a movie is Naomi Watts or Kate Winslet and for Isabella is Julianne Hough or Amanda Seyfried. Let's see if Hollywood takes my suggestion!This WW2 novel was so beautifully written. This war was a time of bitter hatred and in this story Kristin Hannah brings to life love, survival, bitterness, strength, and persistence.Vianne and Isabelle are the most outstanding characters I've ever read. It would be an honor to know them if they were real. I have so much more I could add but I will not because it would take so much of my review.This is a story that will make you cry and have hope in believing that if you keep stepping forward and never looking back you will make it.I highly recommend this book. It's absolutely wonderful and a gorgeous story. I will cherish it always as it is now one of my top 3 favorites :)I'm looking forward to this movie becoming a film. I will be there opening night :) in the front row!!!
