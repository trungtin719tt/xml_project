I enjoyed revisiting this childhood classic. I first read it at the recommendation of our local librarian when I was in 5th grade. I remember being a bit annoyed with her afterward because it made me cry. Hearing the story now 26 years later and knowing what to expect, I still got teary-eyed.The audio version contains an interview with the author and her son, which I found quite interesting. Having first read the book at age 10, I didn't pay much attention to the dedication page. Apparently, though, Katherine Paterson wrote this book based upon the experiences of her own son who, at 8 years old, lost his childhood best friend to a tragic accident (she was struck by lightning -- how awful). Learning that Paterson wrote this story in part to help her son grieve and make sense of such a painful loss made the story all the more touching to me somehow.While heart-breaking,Bridge to Terabithiais a lovely story that is ultimately about the power of love and friendship.
