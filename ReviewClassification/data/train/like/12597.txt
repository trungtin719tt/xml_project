Kate DiCamillo has a way with words. Yes, she does. I must admit that I'm in love with her writing style, and that I have read all of her works.Some of her books are really funny, like the Marcy Watson series (hey, even a serious reader has to laugh sometime), but the majority of her novel-length works are way too serious to be written off as children's literature.Yes, the are, undoubtedly, children's themes. But not childish themes. A few years ago I had reviewed her Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, and categorized it as Literary Fiction. My review had ruffled up some feathers, but the purists often have their heads so deep down their rectums that they refuse to look outside of the narrow boxes they shut themselves in. With Winn-Dixie, I'm not going to go as far as labeling the book with any particular label, except literature. And good literature it is.This short book could be read in an afternoon. But trust me when I say it is better served over the span of a few days, to let the words and themes settle in. As it is usual with her writing, DiCamillo chose the South for the settings of Winn-Dixie. There is a subtle charm to the worlds she creates, a certain nostalgia for the South I never lived in. It's slower paced, it's simpler, it's poor . . . but it is profoundly human.Her characters are often troubled, and the protagonists in Winn-Dixie are no exception. The child lives with a single father, a preacher. The mother is gone, the community is strange, and the trailer park where they live does not scream "home" at all. The characters in Winn-Dixie do not get saved, they do not heal, but they find peace of sorts, much like in her other writings. There are no inexplicable miracles, just humans united in their suffering of the human condition. The human condition which we can universally appreciate, and which DiCamillo paints so beautifully across the pages. Everyone has a ghost in the closet, and when we let other people see them, we find, if not peace, at least a momentary reprieve from the suffering.Her books end with hope, yet without a complete closure, which would require a complete suspension of disbelief on the reader's part.DiCamillo does one thing I really appreciate - introducing more complex vocabulary to young readers. In an era where adult books are using more and more simple language, it is a treat to read an author who does not oversimplify for the sake of the audience.So, when you are looking for a light serious read (in case of DiCamillo it is not an oxymoron) to share with a younger reader, or to read by yourself (it's good for the spirit to be a child again), give this book a try. You might surprise yourself.
