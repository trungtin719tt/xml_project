Ok, I understand why many people love this book. It is, after all, a retelling of Cinderella. It would be hard to screw that up, right? Well, that's the point; whatever you do is not going to be as good as the original. What had me clawing to get to the end, aside from the fact that I knew how it would end, was having to endure Ella's curse and her horrible step-family every step of the way. I don't remember them being quite so bad in the original. I give it 3.5 stars, rounded up to four, although I don't know why.
