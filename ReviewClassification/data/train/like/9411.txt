Max Lucado's story 'You are Special' is a written as a children's book but it is one of those books which isn't only appealing to children. The message of the story can speak to both adults and children alike and is definitely one of my favourites.The Wemmicks are small wooden people who every day give each other stickers. The good looking or talented Wemmicks receive gold stars while those whose wood is rough or chipped or who can't do much get grey dots. Punchinello always tried to get gold stars but always seemed to fall and mess up and ended up covered in dots. When he meets Lucia he is amazed that she has no stars or dots on her. She introduces him to Eli the maker and he begins to realise that things could be different for him.Beautiful in it's simplicity and message. Looking forward to introducing this one to my nephews as well.
