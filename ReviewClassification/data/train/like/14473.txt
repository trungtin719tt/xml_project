The Hunt for Red OctoberThe Hunt for Red October is a thrill ride you won't want to miss from start to finish the plot keeps you guessing. Why is he doing this? What is his motive? Tom Clancy's unique writing style ties everything together. From engaging characters to an intriguing plot for me it was a must read.The year is 1984, A russian nuclear submarine is steaming to the united states the Americans what her the russians want her back. Could this mean war or is it trying to defect? The Red October was the pride of the soviet navy, designed and commanded by Marko Ramius a captain of the first rank. A trusted party member who has gone rogue and is trying to defect to the United States of America but, Its more complicated than it seems. Ramius father was a hero of the revolution but, to Ramius his father was hardly a hero. For Ramius the state had robbed him of his father that was not the only thing the state would rob him of. On the other side of the iron gate lies CIA analyst Jack Ryan a modest man who speaks his mind. By determination, luck and skill he rose through the ranks of the CIA and now is one of their most trusted analyst. He has the knowledge and the willpower to get the job done.Marko Ramius once a proud loyal soviet who would do anything for the cause. A son of a party chieftain his father was a hero of the revolution but, Ramius had little in common with his father. One thing he learned as a young man was that the state had been corrupted, his old mentor the man that taught him about submarines a good man had died because he had no place to live. Later on his wife would die because, the state had inadequate doctor with poor training. Also Ramius would learn there was nothing he could do. This lead to hate and over time his hate manifested itself into an idea then a plain. A last revenge on the state that had taken so much from him and giving so little yes for Marko Ramius it was the only way.Tom clancy does a great job at making Marko Ramius a likable believable character. This man motivated by revenge trying to escape from tyranny to freedom. Has plenty of obstacles to overcome on his journey, that shows exactly what kind of person he is. You see this near the end of the book when its all over Ramius is empty not happy not sad. He had his revenge but in the end it didn't make him happier.The Hunt for Red October is a perfect example of what was going on during the cold war. People were defecting, also this shows how corrupt communism was. How it favored the few and enslaved the masses. Tom Clancy showed this point in a easy to grasp way through an exciting novel. Still the underlying theme that was shown in the book is revenge doesn't pay, after all Marko Ramius did he felt empty after it was all done.
