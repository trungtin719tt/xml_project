A truly spooky story!!!NEVER PLAY WITH THE BEYONDI was familiarized with the story since I have watched several times the 1998's film adaptation, but I hadn't properly read the original novel and since it's already announced a new film adaptation for April next year (2019), I thought that it was about time to read the book.Certainly it's one of the scariest books by Stephen King, in my humble opinion, not only due the main topic but mainly due the characters involved and their interactions.Family is always a complicated issue since there isn't the perfect family, always there are troubles, some small, some big, but troubles at the end, and when the family messes with paranormal forces beyond their comprenhension......dearest blood will run......and hearts will be broken forever......since accepting to let go those you love is one of the hardest things that you have to face in life, never truly left behind, but when you're terribly tempted to disrupt the natural way of how existence works......you can bet that things will go bad.......WAAAAAAAY BAAAAAAAAD......and even worse when you get totally lost, losing your ties to reason and common sense, and only your heart leads your unholy actions......since the path to hell is paved of good intentions......and a huge mistake not always helps you to avoid of doing it again and again.Messing with death......only leads to more death......and insanity.
