ARE YOU MY MOTHER?Written and Illustrated bu P.D. Eastman1960; Random House (64 pages)(Review Not on Blog)RATING: 5 STARSI loved this book as a kid! First, my dad read it to me, and then I learned to read this by memorizing the story. I was that obnoxious kid that shouted out, "ARE YOU MY MOTHER?" every time I read it. I also remember reading this one way past my age level, as I found it comforting. In my opinion, this is one of those books all kids should be introduced to!
