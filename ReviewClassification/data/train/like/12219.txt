3.5 stars - BR with Lian.When you imagine the fall of the US as a democracy, what kind of state do you think will emerge?I imagine one of two options are most likely.1) A fascist surveillance state - nothing is private, nothing is your choice, your every move is strictly directed and monitored by a governing force (possibly the military). Very little personal freedom.2) A state ruled by money - as David Mitchell calls it inCloud Atlas, a corporacracy. Every part of your life is determined by your economic standing; free social service is nonexistent. Freedom based on income.My point:Prodigy was an interesting read for me because it depicts the US falling into ruin, then splitting into two halves, each spiraling down to become one of the options above.The Republic = Option OneThe Colonies = Option TwoThere's some food for thought. Perhaps Marie Lu shares my views on the fall of the US.I didn't mention this inmy review of Legendbecause the dystopian world of the series wasn't explained and expanded until Book 2. The worldbuilding I missed in the first book was delivered in Prodigy, which was a relief.I couldn't give Prodigy a full five stars because ofLOVE TRIANGLES. UGH.Not one but TWO new love triangles are established in this book and it pisses me off. Not because it was unrealistic; people fall in love in inconvenient ways all the time so that was definitely believable. What I can't stand is when authors turnperfectly kind and lovable peopleintocomplete dicksfor the sake of resolving a love triangle conflict.Ever read theShatter Meseries? Think about Adam's transformation and you'll know what I mean.So Tess, a lovely girl with great prospects and an admirable PLATONIC relationship with Day, all of a sudden falls for him and turns into a raging asshat. This is not okay! Slow-building character development/deterioration: that's reasonable. Total 180s out of nowhere: NOPE. Stop that shit.Aside from that... Though the plot was a bit slow, the unveiling of the Republic's inner workings and the glimpse at the Colonies made up for it. I enjoyed Prodigy nearly as much, if not just as much, as Legend.
