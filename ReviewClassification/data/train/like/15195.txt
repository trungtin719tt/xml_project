I don't know, I just didn't like this book. I mean, it was pretty well written I guess, just not my thing. I could NOT relate to Remy in the slightest. She was extremely unlikable, and a compelte bitch, and, for the record, admitting you're a bitch doesn't redeem you. The way she went from guy to guy, dumping them on a schedule, treating them as numbers on a chart and not as human beings...was frankly disgusting. She supposedly has an excuse, because her mom remarried four times. Big deal. You'd have to live under a rock to think treating people like such crap is actually okay.Don't even get me started on Remy's supposed "friends." Seriously, what the hell was up with Chloe? That girl is more like an enemy than a friend. The others were all right, but not interesting or likable at all. The ONLY likable character in the entire book was Dexter, and Remy treated him like crap on the bottom of her shoe throughout the entire book. Even when she realizes she actually really did LIKE him, she broke up with JUST so she could break up with him. I'm sorry, I know I was supposed to feel so bad for Remy, but really?? Why? She's a bitch, a slut, and totally selfish. It's not like her life was THAT bad. Big deal, she had a few stepfathers. At least she had a mother and brother.And knowing that some relationships don't last is hardly an excuse for treating a really nice guy who loved her like he was her freaking "Ken doll."Yes, the book was funny, and I couldn't put it down, but that was mostly because I wanted to know if Remy ever stopped being evil. I don't know, I just think Dexter was wasted on this stupid book. Maybe I'm cold, but I felt no sympathy for Remy. I just couldn't. She spends the whole book boo-hooing about how she lost her virginity to someone she did't like. Well, who the heck cares? It's not like she was raped. She CHOSE to do that. She KNEW what she was doing, and did it anyway.Oh, and the way she was complaining about having Dexter pursue her was SO annoying. Oh, poor me, an awesome guy likes me. What did I ever do to deserve such hardships? Plus the way she saw all of his characteristics as flaws just pissed me off. Well, he's clumsy and messy and doesn't tie his shoes, so he can't possibly ever be a husband. Um, how do those specific traits equate to such an extreme? What's so bad about being clumsy, anyway? I think it's freakin' adorable. I mean, when she called him a freaking shoelace to be tied, I wanted to jump into the book and throttle her. AND she never apologized for insulting him, and of course he was too nice to ask. Remy wouldn't lower herself to apologize to him. Not even after she falsely accused him at the end. No, she couldn't possibly say sorry. She'll just have to kiss him, because he's not worhty of an apology.Okay, so it's obvious now that I just hate Remy.Plus, this books was SO predictable. The second they mentioned the secretary at the beginning during the wedding, I knew what was going to happen/had been happening. It couldn't have been more obvious had she come right out and said it.And this is just my personal opinion, but I hate authors that use charcters as nothing more than tools. Like every single one of Remy's boyfriends AND friends was a plot tool, nothing more.That being said, I can't say I didn't LIKE the book, because I did, though it was majorly depressing (though it is supposedly uplifting?? But how??). Mostly, I just liked Dexter. I AM in the minority here, though, because apparently this is Dessen's best book. Well...I'm on my second of hers right now, and I already like it better than this one, so maybe I'm just weird.Who knows. Maybe I'll ask Remy for some advice on how to be a heartless bitch, that way I'll be able to understand her better. :D
