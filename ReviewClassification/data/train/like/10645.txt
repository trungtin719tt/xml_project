When these books came out I was busy raising the children, I wasn't reading much, But the main thing was I was to scared to read these books. I am a born again Christian I have believed in God since I was a small child. I have struggled with a lot of fear and with the Lords help and healing I am now a stronger person, so I decided it was time I read this series.It's a story about the end times, with the Lord taking His own home and thoes who come to faith after the rapture and the challenges they face.
