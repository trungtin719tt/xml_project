Okay, not able to do a full review at the moment...I finished this book last night, and I can't get it out of my head. I know I want to read the second book, but I need a little time first.There were some terrible things going on, but then around 90% I kinda lost it(view spoiler)[ They killed off one of the twins??? Terrible! Then when I found out about the doughnuts... ugh- got that sick to my stomach feeling. I can't believe that grandmother and mother!(hide spoiler)]Now to the grandmother(view spoiler)[ Who I despised(hide spoiler)]and the mother(view spoiler)[ who may have been even worse... I mean, doing that to your children, for any amount of money is just bat shit crazy!(hide spoiler)]You AreI wish I could send this guy to pay them a visit...To summarize...Just on a side note, I can't believe so many people I know read this one as children... I'm pretty sure at that age 10-14, it would have given me nightmares.
