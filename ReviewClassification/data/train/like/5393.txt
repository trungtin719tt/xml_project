OH God!I fortunately have this book , a 1963-64 version of this ,now crinkly and all yellowed.Apparently 53 yrs old can you believe it?I treasure it like anything. Somebody tell me how can I preserve this one for the next 30 years atleast?I gave it to my stupid friend to read and stupid gal kinda just tore it.Basically broke my heart.She's lucky she's still alive after this &gt;:(As for the book :Words aren't enough for this classic.Associated with the childhood and nostalgic af.I have reread it like 5 times now.Every time this boook just makes me go through various emotions.Heidi is just :')
