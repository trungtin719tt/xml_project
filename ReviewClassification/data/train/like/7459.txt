ive always had the opinion that the whole paranormal urban fantasy genre is just not for me, no thank you. but fortunately people grow, preferences change, and i am that much better for it because this was actually really good! reading and liking this book made me feel like im finally reaching my full potential as a person. yay me! haha.what i enjoyed most was probably the setting - i dont think ive ever read a book that was set in prague or marrakech, both of which are cities that i adore! so that made this so much more exciting, in my opinion. i also liked the story - i thought it was paced quite well, the characters were decent, and the plot was very unique. the story does end on a cliffhanger, but i actually thought it was perfectly executed and really worked in convincing me to read the next book. my only issue was with the romance. insta-love has never really bothered me, but something about this particular pairing was off. i just wasnt buying what they were selling. but minor bump in the road, still an enjoyable book overall!4 stars
