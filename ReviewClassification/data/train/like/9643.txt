The Elephant Tree is a story of a man trying to escape from his own tedious life, initially seeming unconcerned by committing illegal acts, but when presented with the consequences and potential repercussions of some more serious circumstances, forced to question who he is and what he really believes in. A pretty dark and challenging book, but equally as exciting and rewarding.The book itself is semi-lengthy, easy to read and cleverly written from three different POVs. Those POVs allowed me to really get a feel for the life and mentality of each of the central characters. Detective Fallon, Angela and Scott were all memorable and I found myself empathizing with the miscreants, Scott and Angela. The Elephant Tree is an entertaining criminological thriller that kept me fully engaged. I really enjoyed it and believe others who like dark, suspenseful and psychological stories will as well.
