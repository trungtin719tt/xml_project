Reading a Hogwarts' library's book with the fables taken from ancient times in it along with the notes and guidance of Dumbledore himself, is a magical feeling beyond explanation.With every J.K.Rowling book, before reading it, I instruct my mind that you are holding a brilliant collection in your hand, and so it turns out to be.The five legendary tales in The Tales of Beedle the Bard, took me to the time I used to hear tales from my grandparents when I was a kid and they were with me.Most intriguing part about the stories were that unlike the heroines in the fairy tales, the real world witches had to do their homework in time, so they can acquire the magic, power and mastery they are searching for. It is their hardship and their tenderness that led them to gain what they wished for.The stories are not just stories. If you go by Dumbledore's notes and analysis, they'll relate you to Harry Potter books more and how they were being taught.It was a constant jump from fables to rational thinking that has been described by Dumbledore.A great book to have in a Potterhead's collection, with the stories that every child who wants to perform magic must know.I just want to add this image here though it might seem not related :
