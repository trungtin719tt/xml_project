3.5Well. There was....well, first of all, I have to get a cup of water because I have a major headache.*Goes to get cup of water**Returns*Aah. Much better.Okay,firstsecond of all, my friend recommended this book. So I requested it, and (foolish me) left it lying on the table where I do my homework, in plain sight of my parents. Oops. So THEN my dad says, at dinner:"Oh, Ellie, by the way--I borrowed that book of yours, Runner? Or something?"*gulps nervously* "The Maze Runner?""Yeah, that's it.""Oh. Um. Howw...are you liking it?""Well, it's keeping me turning the pages."And I was freaking all about this to my friend. Lucky me, there isn't any sex or even kissing. ;D And even if there IS in the second one, it won't matter, because this was his comment to me a week or so later:"Oh, Ellie, I finished The Maze Runner, by the way." (He says "by the way" a lot.)"Oh? How was it?""It was....grim, gritty, cheerless, joyless, unrelentingly....unrelentinglydark.," he said in a leaden, hopeless tone. (Yes, he actually said that.)So there is pretty much ZIP chance of him reading #2. :D Hoorah! Seeing my dad reading fantasy was just too weird.On another note,Iliked it. Except Teresa, who, from her description, reminds me of a vampire. And the fact that my friend, who read it first, claimed Minho. Harumph.
