Wow. I am absolutelyspeechless.City of Glass was indescribablyepic.This was, hands down, my favorite book in the series so far. Cassandra Clare has truly outdone herself.City of Glass was just soaction-packedfrom beginning to end that I was literally grasping anything I could put my hands on to keep me from jumping out of my seat from excitement.THISis the series that everyone has been raving about.THISis the Cassandra Clare that everyone loves.With that being said, I've officially completedPart Oneof The Mortal Instruments. I'm curious as to what else Cassandra Clare has in store for us with the rest of series.THINGS I WANT TO SEE IN PART TWO:(view spoiler)[- A badass Shadowhunter fighting Clary- Clary not being a brat- More of badass vampire fighting Simon- Simon's family finding out about his vampire secret- The sarcastic, smart ass Jace that I missed. I'm tired of the sulky, depressed Jace.- Isabelle and Simon. That is all. Sorry, Maia.- Alec and Magnus- I want more Magnus. You can never get enough of the king of sass.- The real Sebastian Verlac- Possibly a new love interest for Clary because I'm tired of Clace even though they're probably endgame- Simon, Jace, and Alec bromance- Clary, Jace, Isabelle, Alec, Simon, and Maia to be squad goals- Jocelyn and Luke happy ending- More badass new characters- Shadowhunters and Downworlders living happily ever after forFOR GOODbecause I already have a feeling that the peace between them by the end of City of Glass doesn't actually last long.(hide spoiler)]Now it's time to begin and completeThe Infernal Devicesbefore continuing on with Part Two of TMI. I can't wait to be introduced to a whole new set of characters in the Shadowhunter world!
