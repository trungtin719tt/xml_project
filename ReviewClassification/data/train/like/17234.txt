I read the Twilight series back in High School, even before I knew the movies were coming out. I really liked the series but by the time this book came out I didn't want to go back and read another Twilight book, but for some reason now I wanted to. I am so glad I saved this book for many years later. I never re-read books unless I have to, so this was a great feeling of reading a Twilight book, but not re-reading anything I had previously read. I forgot how amazing Stephenie Meyer is at writing. She really draws great pictures in your head of what is going on, and she makes you feel exactly what her characters are feeling. I really need to read another book by her! I haven't read anything by her but the Twilight series.I suggest this book to anyone that has read the Twilight series :)
