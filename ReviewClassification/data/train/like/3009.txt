When I was very young, like the little rabbit child depicted in Margaret Wise Brown's classicGoodnight Moon, I also had the tendency to bid goodnight to most if not all of the objects in my room (both those readily visible and things located in drawers and closets). And therefore (although truth be told, I actually never did experienceGoodnight Moonas a child, which I really kind of regret more than a bit), both Margaret Wise Brown's text and Clement Hurd's accompanying illustrations have felt magical and sweet not only just in and of themselves, they have also (and of course) nostalgically taken me back to my own childhood, where indeed, once I had retired for the night, I would spend many minutes telling my books, my toys, my furniture and such goodnight (but ironically speaking, not the moon, for as a young child I was actually kind of afraid of the moon, especially when it was sickle shaped, and thus usually rather avoided either looking at the moon or talking to and about it).A wonderful combination of Margaret Wise Brown's gentle and repetitively lulling text and Clement Hurd's brilliantly rendered pictures (which juxtaposition of bright colours interspersed with monochrome does much to gently tone down the inherent garishness of the former), in my opinion,Goodnight Moonis a perfect bedtime read for the very young, in all ways deserving to be labelled a classic and much beloved by many (and honestly, I also cannot believe and fathom thatGoodnight Moonhas actually sometimes been challenged as supposedly inappropriate simply because some obviously seriously emotionally unbalanced, mentally unhinged puritans have found the fact that in the little rabbit child's room, there are a few dolls depicted as being in the buff, as wearing no clothing as somehow anathema and supposedly sexually charged).
