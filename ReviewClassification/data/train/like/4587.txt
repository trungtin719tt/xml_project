I have just finished this book and wow what a read. I'm not at all into horror, either in books or in films, and even though my boyfriend has for years tried to get me to read Steven King I've avoided him like the plague. I did know that he wrote other types of books, namely through the re-makes of these books into Hollywood films, i.e. 'The Shawshank Redemption', 'Stand By Me' and of course 'The Green Mile' but still I was weary of approaching him.It was only after my boyfriend read this and nagged me into doing the same that I picked it up and I'm so glad that I did. The characters are just so beautifully written and I'm not ashamed to say that I cried many a tear even though I knew exactly what was coming up having seen the movie numerous times. If you are a fan of the movie then you can not fail to fall in love with the book as the movie is one of those rare exceptions in that it is very true to its original source. The delight with the book, as is often the case with books, is that it goes into much more detail in particular with the character of Mr Jingles.This book just illustrates how versatile King is as a writer and that in years to come will probably be considered one of the great literary genius of the Twentieth century.
