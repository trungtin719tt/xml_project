Actual rating 4.5/5 stars.This is my second time reading this infamous Christie novel. I have also seen a stage adaptation twice. However, despite my familiarity with this plot I seemed to have forgotten much of the compelling complications and conspiracies, and the captivating confusions and collusions, involved in this fascinating murder mystery. I found just as much to intrigue me, as during my first reading many years ago, even as the murderer was known to me and the central mystery already solved.
