I had an illustrated Folio edition of this book on my shelves for almost a decade and I kept skipping over it to reach for other books. Finally, a nudge from a Read Harder challenge prompt got me to pick it up and I am glad as I thought it was amazing.This book fits rather well into my reading year after recently finishingAmericanahby Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie andWhat It Means When a Man Falls from the Skyby Lesley Nneka Arimah both dealing with modern day Nigeria or the Nigerian diaspora. It was a nice counterpoint to read about village life pre-colonisation and from the "father of modern African writing". Far from being the dry classic that I feared, I discovered why this is so rightly revered.What surprised me about this novel was that even though a lot of the literary criticism suggests this is a book predominantly about the friction between native beliefs and western colonisation, that aspect really only comes to the forefront in the last handful of pages.The first two parts of the book set up the rhythms of village life, the gods, birth, death, marriage, yam farming (there is ALOT of yams in this) as well as introducing the redoubtable Okonkwo and his family. The story doesn't travel fast and certainly not in a straight line, it often feels like we circle around a plot point but never really get there. I didn't mind this slow stroll of storytelling. I think it made the impact of what occurs in the final third that much more powerful.So many scenes from this stand out for me - the locusts, the Egwugwu with smoke pouring from their heads and the various sounds of gongs and cries from the spirit world. This was a very auditory kind of book.By the time I shut the book on the final page I realised how much Achebe had actually packed into a slim novel and how apt the title was.Brilliant.
