Maybe not the very first but still my very first seriously engaged meeting with Woolf V. is undoubtedly successful. I picked Orlando after dropping - temporarily and until I get a more senseful sense of her works - its Essays. I was charmed by the language and its expressions but, in parallel, I was aware that nothing of the content sticks with me, because whatever she was saying as for arguments, debating facts, extensive monologues, was really foreign language to me, although I was reading it in Romanian translation.So, Orlando came by sequence, considering that other two of her works for which I own a paper copy, The Waves and To the Lighthouse, should be held for a later moment, more precisely when on my new summer vacation, which is actually due as for today onwards...not yet there, at destination, but it shall be completed during the present day.Orlando was a really joyful read. I wasn't familiar with the author, actually I wasn't having a sort of framework of expecting something, therefore I was having no scenarios of what could be about. I read, as usual, the back cover of the paper copy but the text was rendering some ideas that didn't ring any connection with something that I might have known about.For all the sparkles that came alongside the pages' turning, it made me clearly remember the joy of reading as if savouring with high gusto a most wanted food. It was like feeling that I do agree with whatever you write about, you really awesome writer. Whatever you write, say, feel, think, is enough by itself and surely something to be kept as a cherished gem. It didn't even count fiction/ non-fiction, theme/subject-wise, participants/non-participants, etc. Reading as such filled a piece of a little void somewhere inside my mind's chambers.Initially I wanted to write about my fuller impressions on Orlando immediately that I finished it. But late last evening my attention was more firmly caught by some information broadcasting on TV about an ongoing event in Bucharest. During the day and continuing until after mid night it was held a Diaspora meeting. Voices were spoken before that this event will not be peaceful and within law. It was not. But this is not what disturbed me. Around 23:00, when the gathering was already infused by street convulsions and some small groups of hooligans tried to attack and trigger into confrontation the police force, I saw plainly and straightfoward how this one group of hooligans managed to detach two gendarmes from their comrades, surrounded them and beat them like hell. One of them is a very young, 20 years, lady-gendarme. She was taken off her head protection and put on the ground and a mass of 20-30 hooligans was over her, almost killing her. She is now in the hospital fighting for her life, might remain paralyzed because of broken back bones.The words cannot render the horror of it. It chased me during the few hours I slept, I woke up with the same feeling. If it were a group of animals attacking other animals for food, might have been explained as life survival. But this was not the case. It were so called humans living in a so called civilized century, pretending to be so called civilized humans.Maybe as Orlando felt, nothing much changed during 300-400 years of existence.Will it ever change something? As it looks, chances are small, almost hard to grasp.
