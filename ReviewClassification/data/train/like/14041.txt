WHY OH WHY?!?I really liked this book until the last page. GRRR!!! There was a REASON why it took me so long to read Bloodlines, and that was because I wasn't sure I wanted to see Adrian written with someone else. But now that Mead has gone and done it, for the love of everything holy, please just quit(view spoiler)[breaking his heart!(hide spoiler)]Write me in instead. &gt;_&lt;Okay, I'm calm now. On to the book...I'm not sure what it was, but this book had a way of making you feel happy (well, for the most part) while you're reading it. I wouldn't say this book was as good as Vampire Academy series, but it doesn't fall too far behind. I LOVED the VA series (except when Rose was being whiny), and Bloodlines fell just a bit short for me because I felt it kind of dragged and lacked in depth as it tried to bridge the gap between what we knew from VA and what we learn in the spin off. It wasn't until much later in the second half of the book became more enjoyable.Naturally, I was hoping for the VA calibre in this book, and Mead sure did not disappoint. The Golden Lily wasn't just your typical story about a special girl going to a boarding school and overcoming the challenges facing her. Mead has developed a pretty intricate web of Moroi, dhampirs, Strigoi, Alchemists, Warriors of Light and possibly magic beyond those we have learned about. For the sake of not spoiling the book, the story meticulously unfolded in a way that even though it wasn't totally action packed, it keeps the reader intrigued from beginning to end.But the thing that was so great about this book was character development. A friend is on a mission to convince me that Sydney was an AWESOME character, and I admit, she was a great heroine because she wasn't your typical badass. She was wholesome - sometimes to the point of awkwardness - but there was an innocence and sincerity about her duty as well as her compassion that make you can't help but love her. Having said that, I'm still very PISSED about the end.Now the character all the girls are waiting to hear about. Adrian.I just don't know what to say except DAYMN he is SO swoon-worthy in this book. From the depression over Rose (oh, please let me help you get over her) and unresolved father issues (I could never think any less of you) to his growing fondness for a certain character (awww, you had SO many sweet scenes I couldn't stop gushing from overwhelming giddiness). He was just TOO adorable for words.The supporting characters were also great. Mead still managed to throw in how wonderful Dimitri was and how wise Sonya was. Jill was her sweet innocent self, while Micah did what he could go take care of her. There were hints of other possible romances and triangles with characters like Eddie and Angeline, especially with so many that are forbidden. And of course there's Brayden, who I thought was just the sweetest, shy, nice guy.This book was just really well rounded, and there wasn't much not to like. It's not to say it wasn't flawless because there were parts in the book that Sydney would briefly tell about a past incident, and I wasn't sure if I had read it before or if she was just mentioning something new but not elaborating. And I am curious to know more about this earth magic and the Alchemist blood. Just more things to look forward to in the next book, I suppose. In the meantime, I'll just have to continue swooning over Adrian. :)
