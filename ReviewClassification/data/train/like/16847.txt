This was a book I nearly quit on. However, just after half way through, the story gets very exciting. I know it's a classic, but Mr. Cooper can be difficult to read. He uses the words LATTER and FORMER like they're going out of style. I'm very glad I made it through the tedious stuff and really enjoyed the second half.
