Why does Memorial Day weekend exist? Holidays are screwing up my Amazon shipping speed so I won't get my box set until Wednesday! This book was amazing and really something I needed right now. It's right up my alley for fantasy and although sometimes the characters got on my nerves, I really love the world and the plot and it was all together a great story. Sometimes the writing felt a bit young for me but that doesn't make it any less of a great novel. I know vampires are kind of "out", but if you like contemporary fantasy, this is 100% worth checking out :)?
