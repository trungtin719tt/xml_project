I remember reading this book a few years ago and really loving it. I also read the sequel back then but I never really finished the series.Now I'm gonna finish it.This was such a quick and enjoyable read. Although it has many tropes that we all hate, such as love triangles, I still found myself enticed by the story.I am so excited to get the rest of the series in the mail so I can continue!!
