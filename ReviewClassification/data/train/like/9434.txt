Although, purposefully didactic, it was beautiful. It read incredibly fast, but it sits with you for a very long time. Imagine eating something quick and cheap like a taco bell burrito only to discover that once it reached your stomach, it felt like a 7 course meal at a 5 star restaurant. Definitely plenty of intellectual bang for your buck.Lately, absurdly leftist books such as the previously reviewed Illuminatus! Trilogy have just pissed me off with their "all we need is to love each other" propaganda. Human existence can not encompass and explain all emotion. And Ishmael doesn't even try to do that. But it does, and very simply, lead the main character and through the main character, the reader, down the path of enlightenment. Much like describing the laws of gravity and aerodynamics, this book takes on the daunting task of coming up with a human law. A real human law. This book, in under 300 pages, gives the meaning of life. Don't look for me to give it away in this blog, but I will say this. The book will make you think. The educator, Ishmael, (who also happens to be a talking gorilla) leads the narrator and thus the reader through the thought process of figuring it out. The book will make you question everything you've ever been taught about religion, science, philosophy, and most importantly, human evolution.I can't say more about this book without going into the exact thought process, which will spoil the book for those who plan on reading it. I don't hold the pretension that everyone who reads my book and movie reviews rush out and buy books and movies based on them, but with this book, I'll stand behind it. Read it. It's a quick read. It's an easy read. And while the ending (and solution for saving the human race) is somewhat far fetched, or rather, no one will really do it, the least that will happen is that you will think.
