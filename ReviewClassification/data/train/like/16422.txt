I absolutely loved "The Ocean at the End of the Lane"! I wish it had been longer! I'm late to the party, so so late to the party!This novel was much darker then I expected it to be. It is also so well-written! I mean the writing is just beautiful!!!A middle aged man goes back to his hometown to attend a funeral and he revisits his childhood memories of the time he was friends with a girl named, Lettie Hempstock. She was his only friend. The boy is age 7 and we are never given his name. We are never told who the narrator is. Ursula Monkton was a piece of work and tormented him. She is his enemy! This is basically a dark and beautiful fairytale that feels quite real and was a bit disturbing at times. I hope that I am making sense. I've never done a review for a book so hard to review!This isn't my normal genre. In fact the only reason I listened to the audio version of this book is because I purchased it on special from Audible a few months ago. I can't believe it took me this long to get to it. I just didn't think I'd like it. I was wrong! Completely wrong!The lesson I learned from this book is that it's very important to step out of my comfort zone and that I need to listen to more books by Mr. Gaiman!The one thing I will say is that I don't usually listen to audiobooks read by the author. They tend to be monotone. Not this author! Boy can he tell a story! He's just under Colin Firth as a narrator! That says a lot because Mr. Firth rocked my world with his narration of "The End of the Affair"!!!Highly recommended!
