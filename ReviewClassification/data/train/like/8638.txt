4 - 4.5 stars.So...I seem to always have the unpopular opinion.For me, the previous book,Dragonfly in Amberwas a much more interesting read for me. I preferred all the quiet, emotional moments in DIA than the seemingly over-the-top adventures in the second half of Voyager. Not to say I didn't still devour this book like a starving man.As with the first book, I found myself being extremely frustrated with Claire throughout Voyager. Constantly doubting Jaime when he has proven himself time and again to her. Yes, the situation with(view spoiler)[ LegHair(hide spoiler)]was messed up. BUT....she was gone for 20 flipping years!!! He wasn't supposed to have a life without her? It's not like her life didn't continue when she left him. And while she was admittedly far from happy with FR...it is extremely selfish of her to just assume that if Jaime did survive that he would remain alone forever. But...I digress. That is obviously a sore subject for me, Claire's double standard way of thinking....so I will leave it alone now.Anyway, I liked the addition of the new characters...especially LJG. I for one think John Grey is in incredibly interesting addition to the series, and while I realize that fans either love him or hate him...i personally love him, and am even more excited to read his side books that tie into the main series.So, to wrap up....I enjoyed Voyager quite a bit. Was it without bumps in the road for me? No. Did I find myself wanting to punch Claire in the face at times? Yes. But, the overall world that Gabaldon has created here is addictive and well written enough to keep me coming back for more.
