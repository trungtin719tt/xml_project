First an update on the Direwolf situationI still do not have one...sadface.This series !!! What can I say I am loving it! I don't know if I was just sick of everything else or just needed the escape but I am soooooo enjoying.The great thing is that I am on the third book and its not like I can't say which book I like better, which was weaker they are one long story that come in three(so far for me) packages.Its not like Indiana Jones. Where we say" man I love Indiana Jones but... that second one WTH? " You know, with Kate Capshaw and her never ending shriek and there were monkey brains.Do you remember the monkey brains?I remember the monkey brains.Refresher**I will make no mention of Indiana Jones and the skull of shit or whatever it was called because I have decided that Harrison Ford needed a new boat and it should not be included in the series.Anyways A Song of Fire and Ice seems to different from the other series I have read *cough* Sookie Stackhouse *cough*. I find them very refreshing and I never have any idea where its going or how he is going to get us there,also do not get attached to anyone cause George R R Martin be killing bitches left right and center. No one is safe.Confession time: I seem to have a crush on The HoundWHAT?Shut up!I dont want to talk about it!Whatever! I am not even sure he is alive,the last time we saw him he was feeling a bit stabbed under a tree and I am not puting a "spoiler tag" on that, cause if I don't know then I am not spoiling anything.Maybe its cause he is so grumpy?This series brings out some weird attractions, my friend said she thought Littlefinger was sexy, he is a quirky mother f@&amp;ker I'll give ya that, also she did not judge my hound problem so we're good.
