This book is an interesting mix of fantasy and scifi. Hi-tech meets the fairies. I loved its world building especially all the lore on the fairies, their location, their rules and regulations etc.Artemis a genius, but my favorite characters were Butler, his butler, and Captain Holy Short, a fairy who is his victim.The book is a quick read. It will be hard to put it down even if you have to. :)
