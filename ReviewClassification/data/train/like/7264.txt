Take a bit of the child-like innocence vs. evil ofHarry Potter, some of the artificially-created destiny fromEnder's Game, throw in the flying fantasies fromEragonand mix them in with Patterson's trademark flippant characterization, and you've gotMaximum Ride.This is the book I'm going to recommend when everyone's recovering from the end of Harry Potter later this month. Really. It's that good. And the best part is there are two more books after this one. There's already a waiting list for my copy.Premise: six kids bred with avian DNA in a lab (which explains their superstrength and their wings) escape in pursuit of a life as normal kids, as normal as you can get without parents.Written for teens, so it's automatically a fun and fast read. Definitely worth the time, even if there's a few places where continuity and plausibility are challenged.
