I just realized that Greg gave me a default recommendation...I don't know the book is good though. It is tough to thing of what to say about this book. It is a giant joke, but it also is pseudo philosophical, and then it also seems to be trying to give some kind of weird advice.Spoilers!!! not. The last line that has nothing to do with the story is "It's never too late to have a happy childhood." A perfect example of this weird advice thing that Robbins does without telling you anything about the story.There are princesses, frogs, arabs, pyramids, communists, aliens, and conspiracy theory.The first twenty or so pages are a bit WTF but once you get through them the rest of the book just flows through after that.
