Aside from a few awkward (racist) sayings this book is as fresh and topical today as it was when it was written in 1937. I am sure I read this in the past but its plot had faded away probably replaced in my mind shanty by the theme song to the New Zoo Review which for some reason I can't get out of my head.At any rate this book begins as many of Ms. Christie's do, setting the stage by introducing us the the victims and suspects. We have a ridiculously rich young American girl living in her newly acquired and restored pile in England, her friends, her business advisors, her new husband, a British mother and son who are too aristocratic to really work but too poor to really enjoy it, an aging spinster who is the relation of some robber baron, her nurse and niece, and many many more and to all of this we add M. Hercule Poirot.All of these story lines will collide in Assuan now known as Aswan. Here we begin our locked room or cruise up the Nile. On a ship where everyone has a secret everyone will be a suspect and the red herring are running.The clues are all there and when the answer is revealed you think, I could have figured that out ... but you didn't M. Poirot did.Vocab:defalcationsDefalcation is misappropriation of funds by a person trusted with its charge; also, the act of misappropriation, or an instance thereof.
