Before I say anything else, it's important you know that I LOVE HARRY POTTER. In my fingers and my toes. LOVE.That being said, this is my least favorite of the early books (I'll let you know whether it's my least favorite overall after I reread HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX).The reasons are LEGION:1. Gilderoy Lockhart is a prat and I hate him.2. Deathday party. It's creepy and gross.3. Poor Ginny.4. The trouble Harry and Ron get Mr. Weasley into stresses me out.5. I don't like snakes.6. I HATE spiders.7. Dobby needs to calm the eff down:BUT. This is Harry Potter we're talking about, so there's also plenty of awesomeness:1. Dwarves dressed as cupids, delivering singing valentines.2. MOLLY WEASLEY.3. Ford Anglia in the wilds of the Forbidden Forest.4. Polyjuice Potion5. Gnomes shouting "geroff."6.(view spoiler)[Lucius Malfoy getting taken down a peg.(hide spoiler)]SO. Even if this is myleastfavorite, it's still Harry Potter, and Harry Potter = AWESOME. If you haven't already, READ IT. If youhaveread it, read it AGAIN. That is all.My other reviews for this series:Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone (Harry Potter, #1)
