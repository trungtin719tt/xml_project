(2016: review to 9780141195872 cover - hardback, red devils cover art:)(I didn't read the main text of this one, but I think I will read the English half at some point.)This one has chronology, introduction, map of Italy, plan of Hell plus commentaries and notes at the end. The main text itself is shown with Italian text on the left side, English on the right side. Commentaries include many comments on the linguistic details that I don't remember the paperback Penguin version having. There is also a cord for bookmarking one's place.I don't know exactly why I would want another copy of this book, but it just looked good. The Inferno (edit: I mean, Hell) is not my favorite of the three, but I can see why it would be the most popular - it certainly can feel exciting and the religion part is less in the front. (And also you can feel the climb from how especially the Paradise can feel like a place where air is thin :) ) So getting this was more about liking the whole, not just this part. But it is enjoyable kind of a book. Again.
