Mistress Suffragette is a thrilling story about a young girl whom history has given very few choices. After Penelope's father's business fails and her fiance leaves her, she finds that she must take care of herself. Edgar Daggers offers her security and passion if she becomes his mistress, but she will have to give up her reputation. I liked following Penelope because of how strong of a person she is. Despite her situation, she takes control of her life. She is also a relatable person with flaws. She lusts over the man she knows she shouldn't want and is afraid of the changing world. The look at the suffragette movement is also an interesting view of history. The book is exciting, has an in-depth world, and shows the struggle of being a female in history. I very much enjoyed this book and would recommend it to lovers of historical fiction and romance.
