Robbins has one of the most unique narratives I've encountered. He's genuinely funny, witty, and shares a penchant for the absurd and punny. He's a wordsmith and throughout his writing one can't help but feel that he's full-force funneling a rabid faucet of clever and meaningless musings constantly streaming through his hyper-associative mind.Woodpecker is, at heart, a take on a classic fairytale story disguised in an absurd set of characters and an abnormal setting. Robbins leads one through his meta-writing world, often interjecting self-conscious chapters about the process of writing the novel. He also uses the characters as obvious vessels to relay his philosophical musings, many of whom make very good points.Robbins self-aware writing makes a point out whenever he introduces allusion or insight, which, though it tickles my meta-bone, it also makes the novel a bit hollow. I couldn't help feel that Robbins' tale never managed to get past the surface. At the end of the day, most of the novel is hollow and substanceless. The characters are quirky but remain undeveloped.The sum of Robbin's antics is a highly enjoyable and clever book that does all it needs in the quest to entertain and occasionally poke a finger at the absurdity of it all.
