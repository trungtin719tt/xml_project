Alongside the Robots, the Foundation must be the most endearing (and enduring) thing that Asimov has created. Being the mathematics nut that I am, I enjoyed the whole concept of being able to predict human behaviour accurately statistically, given the size of the population was big enough. The discipline of psychohistory is presented with just enough uncertainty to make it credible. A terrific read!
