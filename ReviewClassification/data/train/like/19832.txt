With Hardy, one should remember Murphy's Law: What can go wrong, will go wrong. The story opens with a man getting drunk and auctioning off his wife and infant daughter to the highest bidder. What a compelling opening! What further could go wrong?Many books start at the end, then go back and tell you how they got there. This is not one of them. Instead, Hardy begins with this horrible event and then skips nearly two decades, plunking us down into the future of that man, wife, and daughter.Hardy's characterizations of the two main male characters is good, that of the women not so much, although certainly not as stick-figure horrible as Dickens. Perhaps the best characterization is that of Casterbridge itself and the surrounding farm country. He does this not just with some physical description, but with caricatures - those many supporting people that provide a sense of place. The prose is not what one thinks of as 19th Century challenging, but he does throw in an occasional convoluted sentence.I hope to read more of Hardy, though will probably not be a completist. I think I still preferTess of the Durbervilles, but this runs a very close second, and is a good, solid 5-star read.
