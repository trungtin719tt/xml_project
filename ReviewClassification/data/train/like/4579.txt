I know there has been controversy concerning this book, how much is true and how much fiction. And there has been a charge of plagiarism for one section, which Haley admitted. But the experience of reading this book is overwhelmingly powerful. Some of it is very hard to read emotionally, but it holds a connection with the reader. It is definitely 'not' a book about the horrors of slavery, at least in my opinion, although there are certainly horrors within it. It is, instead, a book about human beings struggling to hold onto love, and each other, and to a bit of their history in the face of overwhelming opposition. And it is a book in which these humans beings are successful. In that sense, it is quite a hopeful work.In addition to the story itself, this edition there is a wonderful afterword by Haley about the writing of Roots.
