This was my nephews favorite book growing up. It had special meaning because I was raising him during his own mother's issues. At the time, they prevented her from being there. It broke my heart that maybe this little boy was confused about which of the women in his life was actually his mother. Maybe it is why this story meant so much to him. All I know is that he would crawl into my lap, with his battered copy of this book, and ask me to read it to him, over, and over again.Imagine my surprise when over a decade later, this book is mentioned in. It brought back so many sappy memories.
