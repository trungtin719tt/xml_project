Allen Ginsberg, a sad and lonely man, wrote this to impress Kerouac, another sad and lonely man.Over the years, a lot of sad and lonely people haven't gotten over the how much that first fucking line resonates with them.The whole best minds/generation/destroyed/madness line.Ten years ago, this was a 5-star poem. Ten years from now, it will be a 3-star poem.That's just called growing up, folks.
