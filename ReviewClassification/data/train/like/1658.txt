Reading Fahrenheit was an eye opener. I thought that the golden and silver eras of science fiction had works that have aged with the grace of the Rolling Stones. But here is a book to prove me wrong.Fahrenheit might be the book by which I rate and measure and gauge and review science fiction books. I wish this is not a false dawn, nor an exception to the rule.The book's theme is crisp in its actuality. This was a prophetic book. I rejoiced in the perfect pace that was contained in so relatively few pages. My wavering belief in science fiction has been stabilized.
