With the movie coming out, I finally decided to read the book (however, I don't intend to see the movie as it looks really bad). I wasn't sure what to expect from the book. I didn't know a whole lot about the book before reading it, other than the basic premise.In keeping in line with my love of all things Irish, I enjoyed that this book was set in Dublin. I'm surprised that that author was as young as she was when she wrote the book. I also can't help but like the fact that she's the daughter of the Irish prime minister....but that's irrelevent to the book.I thought the characters were incredibly well developed. It is every wife's nightmare to be in Holly's position but I feel like she captured as best as possible what it would be like to be her. There were so many moments where I found myself crying, which was a bit awkward because I was reading this on the train.Unlike a lot of chick lit books, the side characters were also well developed. Her friends and family were portrayed in a realistic and entertaining way. I especially loved the sibling dynamics. I did have some issues with the ending of the book but I don't think that's a bad thing. I don't believe that one has to agree with every decision an author makes in order for it to be a good book. All in all, Ms. Ahern does a great job of straddling the fine line of writing about a woman trying to get on with her life after the death of her husband.
