This is my first Mark Twain. Yep, you read that correctly. Of course I knew the author. I knew his actual name, how this pen name came about, that he was a cat lover, that he might have been a child of his time but also highly critical of certain social matters such as slavery. But I had never read his books. It was about time. And the current weather (hot and often humid too) was perfect as a setting.This is a book for younger readers. The protagonist is Tom Sawyer, a mischievious boy who lives with his aunt as his parents have died. He's seldomly up to any good although he's never a truly bad child. He just loves to play and be wild and free instead of going to Sunday School or Church services and I can't blame him. Especially after "seeing" where he lives thanks to Twain's nice descriptions of the little town named St. Petersburg, the creek and river and nature all around.But his jokes are mostly harmless, usually only getting slightly out of control thanks to his aunt's squeamishness and other people's piety. However, there are some serious matters this summer, too. Because there are bad people in this world as well, of course. And Tom ends up right in the middle of a murder and further criminal enterprises.It's funny how Twain managed to write about a few boys' wonderful summer while also writing about religion, the slavery system, criminals and those first butterflies boys and girls feel. The social criticism is light, just some "stuff" Tom and his friends notice in this world they are living in and either don't understand or flat-out don't like very much - or imitate to the point of ridiculing. A wonderfully gentle way of educating the younger readers this was written for.My audio edition was also narrated by the impeccable Nick Offerman and he brought the American South to life like you wouldn't believe. Be it aunts in tears or girls screeching or boys fighting ... he always found the perfect voice.
