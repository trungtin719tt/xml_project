I loved this book. Beautiful story and very well written.It made me cry a few times and also appreciate things in my life....especially my loving and thoughtful husband. He works away from home and at times I am so lonely without him. So I could feel Holly's pain and lonliness. This year is our first Christmas apart and I've been rather blue lately. A few chapters in the book were hard to read and I had to put it down for a while and watch TV instead.Thankfully though I know he is coming home unlike Holly's husband.This book has also been made into a movie. I read the sypnosis of the film and decided I'm not going to see it. They changed the story and characters around.....her Mother they make out to be something different from the book. They change how she gets the letters and leave out what I think are important characters. I hate it when they do that to movies made from books.So before seeing the movie I advice reading the book.
