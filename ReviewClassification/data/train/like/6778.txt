Oh goodness heartbreak.I'm one of those people that as soon as I hear a book is being made into a movie, I decide I should read it. But honestly with this one, I have no clue why I waited so long. I have heard over and over about how much others have enjoyed it and yet held off myself. Lesson learned.Me Before You is the story of a young girl who finds herself the caretaker of a quadriplegic man who is both charming and brash depending on the mood. And yet, there's something about him that she finds herself drawn to. In order to help make his life better, she plans out a fantastic series of events in order to make him happy.I must tell you, the characters in this story are perfectly done. They're lovable, hatable, questionably insane - but all so wonderfully done that you never get bored.I started this book while on a plane to Hawaii and despite my happiness toward embarking on a vacation, I still cried. Good God, the emotions. If you can make it through this one without shedding a tear, hats off to you. I couldn't do it.What did I think?:This is one of the most emotional books I have read in a long time, if not ever. I absolutely can't wait for the movie, and after hearing about the casting I'm even more exciting. I don't know whether to call it "chick-lit" as I think there's something in it for everyone, but it's certainly an easy read, but one that should probably not be read in public because crying in public is apparently a weird thing to do.Who should read it?:Are you looking for a good book? Read it. Are you in need of a good cry? Read it. Are you planning to see the movie? Read it. Are you going to be forced/dragged to the theaters by someone else in order to see the movie? Read it. You get the picture. (Read it.)WEBSITE|TWITTER|FACEBOOK|INSTAGRAM
