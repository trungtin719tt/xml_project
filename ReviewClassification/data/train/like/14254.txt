Ack...these books are so terrible, yet so entertaining. I can't stop reading them, even though I'm mortified to admit that I like them. I was also terribly confused when I started reading this book, and even had to check to make sure that I didn't miss a book in the series somehow. Somehow Sookie's cousin, who has been turned into a vampire by her lover, the Queen of Louisiana, is murdered, but all this happens before the book starts, leaving me a bit confused. Some random thoughts on my part--I like the weretiger Quinn, although every time he calls Sookie, "Babe", I gag. A lot. Amelia the witch is wonderful. How can you not like a character who accidently turns her lover Bob into a cat during sexual experimentation? Bill the Vampire totally and completely sucks. I knew there was a reason I never warmed up to him or even saw any attraction in him. (Give me Eric's liveliness any day!) One thing I really enjoyed about this book is when Sookie starts meeting some of the vampires who work for the Queen of Louisiana and how they tell her a bit of their history. Saxon twins--love it. And I enjoyed the part where the Queen tells Sookie all about her past and how she became a vampire. The ending was exciting and fast paced, too. A fun read.
