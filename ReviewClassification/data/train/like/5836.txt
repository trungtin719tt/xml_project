Wow! What a powerful book, I can't believe I hadn't read it sooner. I've seen the movie a numerous amount of times because I'm a big fan of both Matthew McConaughey and Samuel L Jackson. My eyes were glued right to the pages from beginning to end, I just couldn't put it down.I remember watching the movie for the first time when I was in my mid-teens and I remember not liking it at that time because it was hard for me to understand the court and legal system, but as I got older I watched it again and I loved it. This book is to me not just John Grisham's best book, but it is now a book I'm putting in my list of favorites. The book is very emotional and some parts were very disturbing and hard to read, and it's sad to say it's probably happened in real life. An excellent book that I recommend to everyone!
