From the first page one knows one is in the presence of a master story-teller, who will keep one keenly wondering what will happen next, and how he will next digress.It is a book to savour, and I miss it keenly all the time that I'm not reading it. Musil reminds me of Proust in his range, whimsy and delight in life, and in the elegance of his style.It is also topical, as it depicts Austrian society (specifically Viennese society in the last days of the Habsburg Empire) on the eve of the First World War.
