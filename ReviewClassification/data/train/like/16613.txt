Another Update: I just saw the movie!!! I liked it! Woody Harrelson - Brie Larsonand Naomi Watts were all great! I thought they got the important 'duel' emotions just right. On one end - the parents did not 'protect' their kids appropriately at all-- lots of crazy dangerous chaos-On the other end - there was no question the parents loved wholeheartedly their children AND there were 'some' great gifts they gave their children - so our emotions are 'mixed'.At the end of the movie when they show the real -Jeanette Walls &amp; her mom- plus wonderful photos of the kids growing up... it's very touching?Update: I just read some place that a movie is being made of this book. I want to share something about my relationship with "The Glass Castle" --that I've shared with a few people on this site --but never with the larger community.I read this book in 2006. It was a gift from a friend. She mailed it to me from New York. She said..."YOU MUST READ THIS BOOK". The book had only been out about a week. I wasn't much of a reader.My friend knew me well --knew about my childhood --and said ...."you 'will' read this book".Paul and I were leaving for Harbin Hot Springs --a regular -'get-a-way' place for us at the time. I took "The Glass Castle" with me. I mentioned in my other 'little' review --that I read it while sitting under a tree. The author became my hero!What I 'didn't' say was ....."I then read another book, right away"! I liked it too! Then another book... Then another! I HAD *NOT* BEEN A READER UNTIL THIS BOOK!!!!!!!!I'm not saying this was the best book in the entire world -(but it was great),- but I'm saying 'something' happened to me. I have been reading book-after-book -after -book (never NOT reading a book) --since 2006!!!Looking back, I'm 'thankful' the following few books were all good experiences. Had they been awful books....I might not have kept reading.Having several good books under my belt, if I hit a book I didn't like later on, --I didn't worry any longer. I knew reading was enjoyable. I felt comfort in ways I couldn't explain.I wanted to call my long time friend 'reader' friends from Jr. High School (Lisi, Renee, Ron) ---friends who were always reading --and say....."why didn't you tell me"? "why didn't you tell me how intimate -personal - WONDERFUL - READING WAS? ------Now, as an adult, I was not reading for a class....or a grade. I wasn't reading to please anyone!!!!I'm still clear I have holes in my education. I KNOW I'm a LATE BLOOMER READER.....(For many many years of reading these past years --I still wasn't sure if I would call myself a reader --I just knew I was always reading)Point is ---I found READING ---LATE IN LIFE!!! (Its NEVER TOO LATE).Nobody can take away something you really enjoy! I may not be the smartest cookie in the room --- but I'mhonored to 'be-in-the-room'!!!I love to hear from THE FLASHLIGHT READERS!!! Oh my gosh --you guys have such great 'childhood' reading memories. I melt hearing them. (sometimes cry).I love to hear from the READERS whose parents read to you OFTEN as a child.I love to hear about books YOUR parents gave youI love to hear about books Members share with their childrenI love to CHAT about books we love together (this si get to participate 'with you now)I love to read 'too'!If I left this site tomorrow ---I'd still have reading -- I'd still have friends to chat about with about books.Its real now -- -- I read! THIS BOOK --(for whatever reason) --- kicked my new reading- habit into high gear!!! ----So, I'm very thankful to Jeannette Walls --she changed my life!Any 3 year old who tries to cook her own hot dog on the kitchen stove alone (my god -bless the little girl Jeannette was) --has me melting in the palm of her hands.Thanks --its never too late to become a reader!------------------------------------------------------------------------Agree with my friend, Victoria!!! (who just read the book and wrote a 5 star review)5 stars!!!I read this book sittng under a tree at Harbin Hot Springs one summer --Jeannette Walls became my hero!
