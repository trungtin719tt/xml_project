Hands down, the most eye opening book I've ever read that actually changed my views and outlook at everyday happenstance in the world. I couldn't wait for the sequel but darn it. It just did not stack up to the first. Sure it's fiction but man..this particular fiction has become my fact by deliberate choice because for me there is no down side in doing so. The book is a sparkler. I passed it on to my husband, who couldn't put it down, then my son who also loved it and finally I convinced my non-reader daughter to buckle down and read it. She was not disappointed. If you're a christian, Frank Peretti pulls away the curtains and give a view of what "might" be going on in the day-to-day goings on of angels in the upper and lower realms. So enjoyable, so entertaining, so satisfying in the end. O man. can anyone come up with something to compare. I had high hopes for the "Left Behind" series that crashed and burn when I couldn't get past the first chapter of the first book. SO there it sits, on my shelf for treasured books only. To be re-read every few years until I die.
