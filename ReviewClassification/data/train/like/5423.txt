An EXCELLENT adventure!Ok, so I'm sort of ashamed of myself because Ithoughtthis was a graphic novel ofThe Time Machine, and I was planning on using it to cut corners. As in, I want to read the story, but...not really. And I didn't flip through this before snagging it at the library.Well, this is the graphic version in the same way that Dr. Seuss is a graphic version of a story. Basically, this is a picture book for the 6 and up crowd who are just learning to read and need the story dumbedwaaaaaaydown for them.So yeah. It was pretty much right on my level.Regardless, this would be a good way to introduce kids (and/or lazy fuckers like myself) to classics.
