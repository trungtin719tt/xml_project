Guys, I had areallygood time reading this one. I'm way out of the intended demographic, but color me pleasantly surprised that this was leaps and bounds aboveTwilight, although I'm not here to hate on those books. As far as YA books go, this one featured one of my favorite platonic female friendships, and I'm thrilled for the portrayal of girls supporting girls as a way to build up lady power, instead of every female vying for attention in meaningless competition. Part of me wants to write a longer review, but a greater part of me just wants to bask in how much I adored this and move on to the next installment. &lt;3Also, the movie sucked.
