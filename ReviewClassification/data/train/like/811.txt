A true masterpiece.Believe it or not, I am still considering how to best write a 'review' for this, one of my favorite novels of all time.I annotated this most recent time reading, in the hopes that it would help when it came to composing my final thoughts.What I am really struggling with is the idea of little ole' me 'reviewing' a masterpiece.I guess my goal is more to compel people to read this amazing piece of world literature as opposed to providing a critique of Stoker's work. Let me think on this a while longer. In the meantime, have a gander at thisThe Lost Boysgif -- a movie greatly inspired byDracula:Review or not, I am so happy to have reread this for the 3rd time.Draculais a book I will continue to reread periodically for the rest of my life.If you haven't read this yet, please give it a go, it may surprise you.
