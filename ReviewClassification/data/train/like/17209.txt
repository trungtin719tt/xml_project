My high school US history class textbook wasBloodletters and Badmen: A Narrative Encyclopedia of American Criminals from the Pilgrims to the Present. It was an interesting, yet very enlightening, way to study the development of the US. Think about it. I also attribute this one course for my insatiable desire to read crime novels - fiction or non. For our final grade we had to readHelter Skelter: The True Story of the Manson Murdersby Vincent Bugliosi. It's banned in many high schools now but we were, hmmmm, tougher back them.Bugliosi was the Deputy DA in charge of prosecuting the Manson clan for the Tate murders. He wrote the book shortly afterward and goes into vivid, graphic detail of the crimes, the scene, the testimony, the police background information. It is incredible stuff. The fact that Bugliosi was able to get a lifetime conviction for Manson, who wasn't there and never actually committed a crime, says a lot about Bugliosi's skill, the fear in America at the time and the nature of the US court system.This is a fascinating read anytime - as relevant today as it was then - but is exceptionally good at Halloween!!
