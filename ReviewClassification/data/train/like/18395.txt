I liked this novel, I think partly because I pictured Charlotte as the character of Lucy Snowe. I felt like it was almost semi-autobiographical in nature. But it's still not in the same league with Jane Eyre, which will forever be considered Bronte's masterpiece. I read where George Eliot and Virginia Woolf believe Villette was her best novel. But in my opinion Jane Eyre is the gold standard of classic English literature. But still, I give Villette 4 stars, certainly worth reading.
