I can read this book over and over and still gain so much from it. It contains such timeless truths, especially in light of today, such as,"They alone see truly who see the Lord the same in every creature, who see the deathless in the hearts of all that die. Seeing the same Lord everywhere, they do not harm themselves or others. Thus they attain the supreme goal."
