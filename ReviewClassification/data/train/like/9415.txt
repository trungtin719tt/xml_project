A quick, charmingly allegorical read with an invaluable message. The author gave young readers a good deal of reasoning credit. While there are clearly Christian principles being expressed, it isn't heavy-handed or over explained. The gist being that what others think of us--good or bad--doesn't matter unless we ALLOW it to matter to us.I liked the softly lit, watercolor and pastel feel to the illustrations. My children were a little off-put by the exaggerated proportions of the Wemmicks, finding them a bit creepy initially. But we pressed on and they acclimated to the art style.My one complaint would be that the story ended a bit abruptly. It would have felt more symmetrical to wrap it up with more completion in just a few pages, instead of leaving resolution largely to the imagination. (My kids did notice this, and asked if the rest of the story was in a different book.) It looks as though this book belongs to a series, so perhaps there is more satisfaction to be found in later installments.
