I remember reading Little House on the Prairie when I was a child, but I never expanded my reading to the entire series. A reading challenge in a Goodreads group I participate in prompted me to read Little House in the Big Woods, and even though it was written for children, I still found it very enjoyable. Throughout the book Laura provides many stories from her childhood when they lived in the Big Woods of Wisconsin in the mid 1800s. I've always been intrigued by what life must have been like during the era before all the modern day conveniences. In some ways, it definitely seems a lot worse - like it being a big journey just to go seven miles down the road, and in other ways it seems better - all thatorganic(Lol) food! I was sad to learn, however, that you have to kill a calf to make cheese.When I think about all the changes that Laura and others living in the same time period were able to see, it absolutely boggles my mind. Laura was born in 1867 and died in 1957. She went from living the life of a pioneer to almost being able to see the first rocket launched into space - Laura died in February and Sputnik was launched in October of the same year. I wish I was old enough to have been able to talk to people who lived through these extreme changes. I'm sure it was like living in two completely different worlds.
