As some people know, it took me one hell of a long time to become a fan of Harry Potter. But once I did, I was completely sucked into that world. So whenThe Tales of Beedle the Bardcame out, I was such a huge Potterhead that I had no choice but to buy this enormous special edition. I've included a number of photographs in this review to give you a good impression of just how special this special edition actually is.The actual book has small iron works which make it quite heavy and just add to the overall atmosphere.The tales actually are tales - not encyclopedic information as in the two previous school books. As fans of the series know, the tales (one especially) are quite important in the end.There are five tales in total, as well as Dumbledore's thoughts on all of them, an introduction and a "personal message" at the end.All the tales are fantastically magical and quirky but also carry a sense of foreboding and are heavy with meaning. Great writing in all of them, that sucks the reader right back into this fantastic magical world.
