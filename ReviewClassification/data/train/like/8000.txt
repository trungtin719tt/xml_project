This book is presented in two books and 34 chapters. Through its pages are several characters and various scenarios are described. We are in the nineteenth century, where the three important points of world society is the city of Paris, London and New York. The plot unfolds in the U.S., in a society where people seem to be in constant conviviality, even the narrative itself begins with a scene at the Opera House. Throughout history, we realized that the lunches, dinners and celebrations were acts relevant at the time, because there was recognized its position in the society. Among the conviviums of the time were the liqueurs and among them, Port wine, symbol of the North of Portugal. Cabarets, bars, cafes, restaurants, clubs were growing places, but there was distinction depending on the people who frequented them. It was normal to smoke, even women, but especially women. Paris was the center of women's clothing. In this narrative, and at this time, women take a prominent place. Marriages in New York were no longer pre-established as in Europe. The author mentions, within the plot, an economic problem that led to bankruptcy of some Wall Street investors.Curious is the preponderant presence, in the descriptions that the author makes, of flowers.According to my point of view, the motto of this story boils down to"The best of situations are the memories."
