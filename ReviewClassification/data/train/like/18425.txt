Going into this book, I was not all that excited because I normally don't read Sci-Fi books. When I started reading I was getting reeled in by the authors use of figurative language and suspense buildup. I was attached to certain characters and by the end of the book I felt like Tam Lin and I were old friends. This book is a great read for you if you enjoy reading about struggles, setbacks and rewards. House of the Scorpion has a little bit of all of those.
