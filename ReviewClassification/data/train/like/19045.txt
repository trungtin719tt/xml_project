I own about 70 copies of illegally-photocopied versions of this book so I can use it with my students in class. And unlike most books I teach, I read this one every year.Why? 'Cuz it's an unbelievable text.I firmly believe that Santiago Nasar is one of literature's greatest Christ-figures. Many of Garcia's books have Christ-figures, of course, but Santiago is Jesus with a twist. When the book starts, Santiago is portrayed as a bad man who is wasteful and immoral and violent. When he is fingered for taking the virginity of a non-whore, any reader would believe in his guilt.But by the end of the book, it is obvious that Santiago did not commit the crime (Garcia hides the line where this is stated unequivocally, but it is there). But he is killed nonetheless (multiple times, actually) and the entire town, who did not stop the attack on Santiago, feels guilty for their inaction for the next twenty years.It's such a brilliant idea that is told so exquisitely, that I can't think of a better sub-100 page book to read over a two day period. And my students can't, either, as I have never had a disappointed student. Ever.
