Some books grab you by the heart and never let you go. For me, there are three: "Gone With the Wind," "The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe," and then "Christy." I try to annually read each, although in recent years (with a new marriage, new college focus, and cross-country move), I have failed in that effort.This year, I decided to rectify that situation, and I am ever so glad that I did, especially with this particular novel.I first read it as a teenager, and it captured my soul then. I loved the idea of a grand adventure to better people's lives and institute social change. But that was then, when I was still looking for my own grand journey and purpose. Now, as an adult, this book spoke to me in a much deeper way on many various levels.First, there was the historical aspects. Before, I was all caught up in the subtle love triangle and the story line. This time, I noticed how Ms. Marshall wove the culture and the dignity and the grace of the mountaineers throughout the entire novel. It was like seeing a new world through a subtle sociological perspective, and I appreciated the novel all the more for this almost academic approach.Second, Christy's spiritual journey really resonated with me. She was asking the big, overarching questions that I recently found myself pondering, and I loved how the book coaxed out an answer from a mixture of characters who all approach their faith in their own ways. While before, I thought that Christy and her relationships provided the heart of the story, this time, I recognized that it was her inner coming-of-age that really makes this book shine.And third, I recognized with renewed respect the wonderful literary ability of Ms. Marshall. She painted vivid pictures of these homes, these people, and what was in their hearts. Every paragraph, every description, every piece of dialogue -- they all served a purpose, and in an age of "Twilights" and "50 Shades of Grey," I find myself craving good, solid, real writing rather than pandering to the popular mood of the moment.I imagine I will read this book dozens times over in my coming years, and I imagine I will be just as touched with each new reading. And THAT's what a good book is supposed to accomplish. Hurrah for Ms. Marshall for doing so.
