I doubt if there has been a better book written about summer and boyhood than DANDELION WINE. Dan Simmon'sSummer of Nightof course comes to mind. But where Simmons gives us the delicious darkness, Bradbury's tale is a bit more full of light and magic. It's all about Green Town, Illinois in the early 20th century. There are no TV's, computers, or cell phones. Just small town citizens interacting as human beings should. It was a time of cigar stores and front porches and soda fountains. Young Douglas Spaulding and his brother make dandelion wine with their grandfather, and they also have many wonderful adventures together. I try to revisit Green Town every other summer or so. The light and magic never fail to amaze me.
