Book #3 for #booktubeathon is DONE!I finished this audiobook on the way to work this morning and MAN do I love this story. I've loved the movie for a long time and I loved this book just as much, although the endings and elements of the story were different. Sarah is such a fantastically beautiful character with such a big heart for others. I loved reading about her adventures and how she continued to have the attitude of a princess, regardless of her circumstances.JUST A GREAT CHILDREN'S BOOK, ERRYONE READ IT.
