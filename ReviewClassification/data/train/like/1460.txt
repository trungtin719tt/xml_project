J.R.R. Tolkien is my favorite author, I love all his books and the movies based on them and I tell people all the time that Lord of the Rings is "literally my life", so it's kind of obvious that I'm giving this book 5 stars.Tolkien's writing style is unique. That is something that everyone should be aware of before going into these books. Middle-earth is the most developed fictional world I have ever read about, and for development on this scale, you need a lot of details. That's exactly why I'm so in love with the series, but I understand whenever people disagree with me.If you're not sure if you should read this and you have never seen the movies, I suggest checking them out first. If you don't like them and don't care about the world, I wouldn't bother trying out the books.If you choose to read them, then get ready to go on an amazing adventure with fantastic characters, great action sequences, lovely poems and songs and High Fantasy at its absolute best.Be aware though that things move a lot slower than in the movies. When I first read them, I was surprised at how much more the books had to offer. For me, it made everything just more exciting, but it might have a tedious effect on other people.
