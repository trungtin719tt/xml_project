Biographical novel about Chris McCandless, a smart 23 year old boy who starts an idealistic journey throughout the forests and deserts of the States and Mexico trying to live accordingly to his Tolstoian beliefs, which denounce all kind of material possessions. The adventure ends up in tragedy when his body is found in Alaska two years after his departure. This story aroused a mediatic debate in the nineties in which some people defended McCandless innocent and pure search for spiritual peace whereas others considered him a stupid, reckless and overconfident well-to-do kid from a rich family who wanted nothing else but to draw attention.The novel flows easy and fast, and I can't think of a better narrator than Krakauer, he exposes the facts in an objective way and leaves the reader to form his own opinion about McCandless: a spoiled, immature kid whose life could have been spared or a free mind who found his own way in a frantic world and who managed to leave track.As a romantic I prefer the second option, but I also agree with Krakauer that youth combined with passionate ideals and some deep hidden frustration can lead to oblivion of danger, we humans do easily forget that we are not invincible.After having read this novel, I believe that living to the limit and suicide are not the same concept, and I also think that McCandless thougth the same. He didn't want to die, but died happily all the same, which is an attitude we might all learn something about."Happiness only real when shared""He is smiling in the picture, and there is no mistaking the look in his eyes: Chris McCandless was at peace, serene as a monk gone to God"
