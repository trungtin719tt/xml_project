*After watching and reading The Lorax by Dr. Seuss*Pollution is one of the major problems of the world.Pollution that is brought by thousands of reasons.One of those reasons include: millions of trees being chopped down (not just in one forest) causing smog to constantly spread and form in numerous parts of the world.And at some point or another, we will begin to realize that having water and fresh air of high quality, in the amount we wish, and whenever we wish to use it, will become extremely difficult.UNLESS...Unless someone can speak for them.Unless someone can speak for something worth fighting for.Nothing is going to happen.
