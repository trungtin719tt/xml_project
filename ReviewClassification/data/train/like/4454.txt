Ridiculous. I mean, I had a vague memory of watching the film while super high in the second year of university and having an absolute riot, and maybe that should have prepared me for the book.... (But enough about that.)Nothing can prepare you for this drug and violence-fuelled look at America's seedy underbelly. Hunter S. Thompson was a genius. Read this utterly compelling and captivating book. That is all.
