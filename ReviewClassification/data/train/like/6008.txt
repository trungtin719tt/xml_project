Of course, my favorite Jane Austen novel is Pride and Prejudice. There are just so many aspects to this novel that I love, and the fact that both main characters are so seemingly different, but end up being so similar is genius. I love how this book is a more "proper" version of a timeless tale of love and misunderstanding.What I enjoyed even more was to find that Jane Austen wrote many of her characters in a similar way. Most of her main female characters are strong willed and sure of themselves, which was quite different from the stereotypical female of that time period. Therefore, not only are Austen's novels entertaining and lovely, they are also innovative.She is by far one of my all time favorite authors and I am glad to have all of her novels in one place. This book is great and I would absolutely recommend any and all of this author's works to anyone who enjoys romance, strong characters, and even history.
