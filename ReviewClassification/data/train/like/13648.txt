Fantastic book. I loved reading this every bit as much this time as I did the first time. It's fair to say it retains it's place as one of my all time favorite books.This is the story of Locke Lamorra, master thief extraordinaire, and his band of thieves, The Gentlemen Bastards. The Gentlemen Bastards are content with their lot in life and happy to fly under the radar in the city of Camorr. Unfortunately they soon find themselves embroiled in the heart of a power struggle for control of Camorr's criminal underworld. Locke's legendary wits are required to guide his merry band of thieves out of this mess safely.The world Scott lynch creates is fantastically detailed and very unique. The plot is fast paced, complex, and extremely entertaining. I loved the twists and turns, the surprises, and of course the cons pulled by Locke and co. The large cast of brilliant characters made even the sub plots a gripping read.This was at times a dark, gritty, and very brutal tale but that was mitigated by the fantastically humorous banter between the characters, and the very real friendship the Gentleman Bastards clearly shared with each other.Highly recommended to anyone who loves epic fantasy and is not to shocked by bad language!.Audio Note: Michael Page is the narrator here and as always he does a fantastic job. He is extremely good at differentiating between the many different characters voices.
