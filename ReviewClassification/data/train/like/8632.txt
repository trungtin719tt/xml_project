THIS BOOK WAS MASSIVE!!! The first half of the book was so good and made me so happy after the heart wrenching ending from Dragonfly in Amber. But then, the last half of the book was so slow. Even though it was super entertaining, the "Voyager" part of the book really dragged on. I feel like Diana could have moved things on a bit. The first book is still my favorite, it's nice to go on these adventure with Jamie and Claire, I just don't know how I'm going to relate to the characters now that they are older. It's still a 5/5 stars for me because the storytelling is wonderful, and I can't wait to continue on the series.
