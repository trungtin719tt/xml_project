I didn't read this book when it was popular (when I was in high school) because my mother wouldn't let me - because of the affair the Priest has. I was also banned from watching the made-for-t.v.-movie. Well, a few months ago she was getting rid of a bunch of books &amp; asked me if I wanted any of them &amp; The Thorn Birds was in there. I asked if I was allowed to read it now that I was 46 yrs. old????I gave this book 5 stars because it immediately pulled me in &amp; the characters were so real. I didn't want the book to end. By the way, the so called affair the Priest had, was pretty mild. I highly recommend this book that is a story spans 6 decades.
