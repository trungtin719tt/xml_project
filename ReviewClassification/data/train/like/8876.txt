Probably First Realistic Femme Fatale of Modern LitThe Prototype for Most Who Followed"Now I ain't sayin' you a gold digger, you got needs.*** Get down girl, go 'head, get down.""Gold Digger," Kanye West, Ray Charles, Renald Richard, 2005Becky Sharp is perhaps modern lit's first exemplar of today's femme fatale. Clever, charming, attractive, as well as artful, duplicitous, hyper-ambitious, a superself-centered woman who uses sex as one of her tools to manipulate men but only to serve her needs. She is the anti-heroine without a scruple in this (subtitled) "novel without a hero.""I think,"she says,"I could be a good woman if I had five thousand a year."I think we've all known at least one Becky Sharp, she usually comes from relatively nothing yet is the first to ridicule those less fortunate. "Old Sir Pitt...chuckled at herairs and graces, and would laugh ... at her assumptions of dignity and imitations of genteel life."There is really only one character who could be characterized as "redeeming" in the entire lengthy novel. Nonetheless, I was thoroughly impressed with and enjoyed reading this 1848 novel which is set in England around the time of Waterloo.
