Original story, well-written, a bit creepy, a lot silly, morality turned on its head for sex and drugs, it put me in mind that it was the Pied Piper in reverse. Not an exact analogy, just what it put in my mind.I've just downloaded the film. It will be interesting to see how much humanity is allowed Grenouille.
