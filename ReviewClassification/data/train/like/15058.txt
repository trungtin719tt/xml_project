when i was little, i would get dropped off at the library in lieu of daycare, particularly in the summer, when there were programs for kids without friends. so, if i spent my childhood in a library, how did i miss out on so many childrens classics?? just what was it i was reading?? (i think i read mostly lois duncan)but this book is great, really. i have learned to respect the newbery award - except for the black pearl(which is just a newbery honor, but still) this book could be republished as an adult book and no one would notice. the writing is very good - she has a great ear for realistic dialogue and she builds tension very well, it is even an adult-book-length! and i was so pleased that the ending didnt make everything all right. i wonder if the woodside library has summer programs for friendless kids. i may have to join them and take the lois duncan out of their hands.
