I think I enjoyed this more than the first book. Carlos is way more trouble than Alex was. You could tell Alex had a heart of gold from the very beginning and his bad attitude was all an act. Carlos was a good guy too, but his bad attitude was real and I think it made him really interesting and made his turnaround a bigger deal. I also really enjoyed Kiara. She was not a typical girl at all and the last person you would expect to fall for Carlos.
