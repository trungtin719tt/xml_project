I read this years ago.. It was the first book I read with The Bay Area Book club..(the local book club I'm still in.I don't think I was a member of Goodreads yet.I thought this book was a little more 'textbook' in sections than I would have preferred .. At the time anyway..But I got value.. It's a good book..,And our book club discussion was excellent.
