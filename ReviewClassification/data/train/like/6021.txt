I think this is my favorite Arthur Conan Doyle story. What a combination; you have a mystery, a horror story with a demon like wolfhound, set on a dark English moor. I've never seen an English moor, but I've experienced them through the great books I've read. I've imagined Catherine stalking the moor in Wuthering Heights searching for her beloved Heathcliff. I've been with Jane Eyre on Marsh Glen when she heard the cry of Jane! Jane! Jane! from her forlorn Mr. Rochester, and I've felt the terror of being on Dartmoor at night with the howling of a demon hound close by. This is a great story and if you only read one Sherlock Holmes, this should be the one.
