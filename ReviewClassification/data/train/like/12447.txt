There was a lot going on in this one, a LOT! I'm finding that as the series grows the poor characters the book is supposed to be about seem to be getting less and less page time, to the point of getting totally swallowed up and lost in everyone else's dramas.That said, the little I did get of Rehv and Elehna together I loved, he needed her quiet strength and support. Ward certainly gives her characters the perfect mates.
