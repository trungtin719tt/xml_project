This is the best book I've ever read.It keeps me out of trouble.I first read it in high school, senior year AP Lit. We read it alongside Kafka'sThe Metamorphosisand had engaging discussions about what the hell was going on (in the books and in life itself), culminating in a detailed "compare and contrast" essay.I read it again on my own the next year, my freshman year at college, just for fun.I read it a third time my junior year, and actually recited a section as a dramatic reading in my Oral Comm class.I read it again shortly before graduating, then again shortly after landing my first job as an English teacher, then I bought a copy for my classroom library in case some precocious student wanted to pick it up on their own.I read it twice more after moving to a new state, once cover to cover and once again in semi-random excerpts, starting with whatever page I happened to thumb to.I read it as my 52nd book of 2016, the last one to complete my 2016 Goodreads Reading Challenge. What can I say? More than 60 years after publication and it hasn't lost any of its charm, or its poignancy, or its power. More than any other book, this one has shaped my worldview. I love the wordplay, how perfectly beauracracy is skewered and mocked, how relentlessly logical thinking leads to illogical ends. I love how it makes you stop and think and appreciate, how it reminds us of the fleeting nature of life and of the value of living. I love how it encourages us to question everything: authority, beauracracy, faith, government, society. Just who the hell is in charge, and what the hell are they doing, and where the hell do I fit in? I love the ending, the final masterful decision Yossarian makes to stop being a pawn and make himself a king -- more than that, to leave the game and its arbitrary rules altogether.I love this book.So, I will read it again, and this review will get a little longer, and I will always affirm:This is the best book I have ever read.It keeps me out of trouble.
