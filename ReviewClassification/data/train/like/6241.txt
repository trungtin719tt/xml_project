4.5 stars.5 stars for Park.-.5 for the ending, which I liked, but not quite enough.It was hopeful, BUT NOT ENOUGH. I was smiling when Park smiled at the end, but that's it. Eleanor was so frustrating some times, I was afraid Park would get tired of her, BUT NO! Park really loved her and he was so cute and in my mind I made an epilogue in which they both have their happy endinggggg.I loved this book. SO, so, so adorable.
