'"Light one for me, would you?"It was the first time in my life that anyone had asked this of me, and as I took the cigarette from my lips and put it in hers, I caught a thin bat's squeak of sexuality, inaudible to anyone but me.'This book hit me, hard. I read it for a course in 'Catholic Literature' which was an excuse for my favorite professor to teach a small group of students about his all-time favorite books. He made up the name so he could teach it as a theology/literature course.We read Brideshead, then watched the film version with Jeremy Irons. Growing up immersed in an Anglophile household, I was amazed i'd waited too long to read this masterpiece. I felt their hearts beating in my chest, their losses and gains in love and life my own, and wept for the friendships within these pages (I was 20 when I read it, so, cut some slack). I reread it frequently. It never leaves my side.
