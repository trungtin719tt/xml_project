In April 1992 a young man from a well to do East Coast family hitchhiked to Alaska and walked alone into the wilderness north of Mt. McKinley. Four months later his decomposed body was found by a party of moose hunters.A really gripping "travel essay" Jon Krakauer tries to move his reading audience beyond pre-conceived notions. What would convince a young man to give up all his worldly possessions and head back into nature? Upon closing the pages, I felt a little bit of sadness that Chris McCandless left the earth way too soon. But in his short life, Chris managed to touch a lot of people along the way and it is their memories of this man that were the best parts.
