Well-written more often than over-written, Clive Barker'sImajicais a picaresque (the blurb from William S. Burroughs adorning the cover of my edition agrees) dark fantasy that seeks to dispel gender binary and then imagine the fluid, and frankly erotic, possibilities for human coexistence. If you are looking for a long read with gender-bending assassins, imprisoned goddesses, magic made out of breath and spit, brutal inter-dimensional ghouls, impossible but consensual sexual contortions, oddly named characters, the profane made sacred, high body counts, sentient lakes and cities, furries and cockney accents, then look no further!
