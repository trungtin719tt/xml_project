The book was exactly what I expected it to be. The way Thoreau defined poverty and the way he justified his life in a little wooden house were phenomenal. The most interesting part was the Conclusion. when I finished the Conclusion part I was in shock! I just wanted to forsake living in a civilized city and go to the woods and live a life in accordance to my ideals. But Alas! I don't t have the guts to do so or maybe I think I don't know how to live a life all by myself.How can anyone think like that and live like that and at the same time JUSTIFIE you that hey the way you're living is not proper. You can create your ideal life by living in poverty. The Contrast!!I should confess that some parts were really boring and I was like" should I skip this part or not"!? (thought I did not skip them!)Speechles as I am ,I want to share a wonderful quote with you( I should mention that the book is full of ethical and inspirational and mind-blowing quotes.If you don't want to read the book then please read the quotes and you'll definitely fall in love with the way Thoreau describes things). So yeah,that's it."However mean your life is, meet it and live it; Do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest. The fault-finder will find faults even in paradise. Love your life ,poor as it is.You may perhaps have some pleasant,thrilling,glorious hours even in a poor-house."
