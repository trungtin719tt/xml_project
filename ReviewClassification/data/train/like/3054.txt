There are a handful of books we read as children that so completely capture our hearts we cannot and would not ever forget them.Where the Red Fern Growsis such a book. An elementary teacher read this book to my class when I was in about third grade, beginning for me a love that has seen me through many personal readings, with even more readings to my own students through the course of my career as an elementary teacher.What most people do not know is that this classic tale of a boy and his hunting dogs was actually written twice. Author Wilson Rawls wrote it the first time and was so sure that it was no good that he threw it away. When friends and family learned of his misdeed they encouraged him to write it again. He did and the rest, as they say, is children's fiction history.This is one of those books that belongs on every child's book shelf. This classic tale of a boy and his 2 dogs is perfect for parents to read to their children. Make sure a box of tissue is handy. I still can't read the ending without shedding many tears.
