Book ReviewRoald Dahlgets 4+ out of 5 stars for his knock-it-out-of-the-park story,Matilda, from 1988. For some reason, I thought this was published before 1988, but I know I read it when I was 13, so... must have been right then. I thought it was great. Looking back years later, and seeing all the films and cartoons made from it, I love it even more. While she's a good role model in many ways for young kids, she's all a little too spunky and might give some the wrong impressions. Nevertheless, with the right guidance, she can be someone to look up to.Not everyone gets the best parents, family, teachers and friends. And when you don't, you better be a smart girl to be able to make it on your own. And that's what she is... brilliant, funny, witty, sarcastic, friendly... everything all wrapped up into 1 adorable young girl. She has a few adventures, tries to make things happen and shows the world who she. And that's all we can ask for! Great book. Great story. Lots to see and learn. Definite re-read some day!About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.
