I liked this book for many reasons:-&gt; it is about magic and a fantasy fiction (which happens to be my favourite genre)-&gt; it isdifferentand isfresh. It does not look or feel like a ripoff of Harry Potter or Lord of the rings (for a change!) nor does it deal with bloody vampires or werewolves (which I am kinda fed up of)-&gt; a very engaging tale which is very humorous, witty and the main protagonist is not a boy or a girl (for a change!). Instead it is a djinni named Bartimaeus. Reminded me of Genie from Aladdin sometimes.-&gt; I liked the way the society is completelyruledby magicians. There is no minister who is a common man. But the magicians have no power. Their power comes from djinni and other demons. So there goes any similarity with Harry Potter that you can think of.-&gt; The boy seemed very stupid and innocent to start with and later on his character was developed well. I loved the last chapter (which was full of lies from Nathaniel's side). Bartimaeus is full of mischief and his footnotes were the best part of the book.-&gt; I liked the way narration was being constantly switched between third person (Nathaniel's part of the story) and first person (Bartimaeus's).-&gt; The climax was something that I really liked. The final encounter of Nathaniel with the villain was good.But more than anything, I liked the style of writing. It was very engaging, had me laughing sometimes, made the book completely unputdownable for even a minute, in short - it was wonderful.Do not miss this book, if you like fantasy fiction!!!!!
