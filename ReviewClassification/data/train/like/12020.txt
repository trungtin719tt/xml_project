Claudia and Jamie Kincaid decide to run away and live in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. They take their instrument cases filled with clothes and Jamie's transistor radio. They live in the museum for about a week on about $28 and some change. They discover that there's more to life than what they thought and that some experiences make you into a better person.Loved the relationship between Claude and her brother, loved how she constantly kept correcting his grammar and how he was in charge of the money. It was a nice change of pace to read a story when pure innocence wins out over drama. Also, loved the mystery surrounding Angel and the role Mrs. Basil E Frankweiler played in the end. Feel good children's book. I can easily see what this book is so popular. I mean, who hasn't fantasized about running away and living in a museum? ;)
