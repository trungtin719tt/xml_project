There is a CD with bits from this book performed by a bunch of the original SNL cast and writers. It is one of the best audio comedic CD's I have ever heard. Ruined the book slightly, but any fans IMO should seek it out. It is really well done and way better than the movie in my opinion.I liked the book but because of above CD was a little let down.Added to original review:Just re-read, liked it even more now. Longing to hear the above mentioned cd but loaned it to somebody, who I guess thought I gave it to her.Anyway my new review of the book below:A quick read but one hell of a long amazing trip.
