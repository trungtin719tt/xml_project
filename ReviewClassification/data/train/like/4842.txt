Y'all Uncle Stevie used this book to work out some feelings he has about his Constant Readers(fans). Annie Wilkes is how Stephen King must have viewed his readers at the time. I get it some of us fans are nuts. I can't guarantee that if Beyonce's car were to crash near my house I won't keep her hostage.I just might do that.Misery is probably the 3rd scariest Stephen King novel I've read. I'm always more scared of things that can actually happen. Stalkers are real and so are dangerously ill superfans. Paul Sheldon could be any of us, especially with all the people we come into contact with on social media. We don't know the affect we have on people who aren't "all there".Annie Wilkes is a superfan of author Paul Sheldon's most famous book series which follows the life of heroine Misery Chastain. Annie Wilkes is also an extremely dangerous woman with a very very dark history. Unfortunately for Paul, when he's injured in a car accident Annie Wilkes finds him and brings him back to her home to nurse him back to health. Since its Stephen King I think you can guess that things quickly go horrifically south.I loved this book and while I haven't seen the movie I just can't imagine it being better than the book(though Kathy Bates is amazing in everything she does). Misery is a chilling at times uncomfortable to read nerve jangling ( I stole that last one from the Kirkus review on the back of the book) decent into true horror. Nobody does horror like Uncle Stevie.A must read!The Final Chapter February book of the month.
