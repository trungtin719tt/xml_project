Superb!Another buddy read with my daughter. This was her class assignment and she insisted I read it. I'm not big on plays, so I was a bit hesitant to read it, but seeing her enthusiasm for it, I decided to give it a try.The characters in this are great. All the emotions can be felt in the dialogues between all the different characters, which I tend to find hard to do in a play format. The book had us discussing what we thought, who we thought was right, wrong, good, bad, etc. I enjoyed this as a buddy read, but above all, the book is fantastic.That ending had me crying. I don't want to give anything away. Now I gotta watch the movie.Favorite quote: Blanche:Whoever you are--I have always depended on the kindness of strangers.Knowing the context of the quote has me choking up all over again.
