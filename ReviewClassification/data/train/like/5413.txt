One of my all time favourite books, I first read this many years ago and as books have been added to the original trilogy I have re-read the whole series. I feel that IA pulled the stories together well, so the Robot novels all join with the Empire novels, what a master.Well I re-read it again (2nd time GR officially, umpteenth time un-officially) and realise (yet again) what a marvellous book it is. Yes it is split as a collection of stories but Asimov is such a master story-teller it all hangs together so so well. Still 5 stars.
