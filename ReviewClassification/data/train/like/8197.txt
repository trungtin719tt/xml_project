I loved this book, although there are parts I hated equally. The cameraderie of the grown ya-ya's was funny as well as endearing. The tragedies were painful to read. This is nowhere near a "classic" book, but it is, for the most part, a fun read. Reading "Little Altars" after this was a mistake. I wish I had left it at "Divine Secrets"
