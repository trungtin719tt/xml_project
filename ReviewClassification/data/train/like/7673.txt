It's not what happens in this story that's important, it's what doesn't happen. It's not what is said, but what is not said.I almost feel like Stevens in a real person and not a fictional character. He may well be the most tragic figure I've had the honor to meet/read. He tried so hard to do what he thought to be the right thing and in the end it all turned out to the wrong thing...I cried for at least a half hour after I finished the final page. It was a bittersweet moment when he admitted to his heart breaking...I hurt so badly for him but for the first time he acknowledge his emotions and so I was happy for me.This story reminds me of why it is important to LIVE your life.I do hope Stevens uses the remains of his day to learn to banter and create friendships for himself. I think perhaps he will.
