I didn't even know this was a trilogy, although I enjoyed the past two "To Live" books. This one was the best of all. Here's an example of Peller's prose: "Like life, speech is often thrown at us in the heat of passion, meaning ripe for interpretation and oftentimes misunderstanding." Or: "And most writers are truly mad. Who else would confront a blank canvas and fill that space with work that dares its own existence?"Pretty inspiring words to read on a Sunday morning watching the sun come up. I got chills reading this book.
