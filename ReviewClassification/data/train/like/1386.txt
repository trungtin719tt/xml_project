Um YES. This is what I like.It took a while to get into and read as I was having to do school work and holiday festivities at the same time, but it was definitely worth it!If you like historical fiction, time travel, and/or romance, PICK THIS UP. You also get the beautiful and perfect specimen of Jamie.
