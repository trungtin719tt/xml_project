I first read The Hobbit at the ripe old age of 12, and remember having to really concentrate to finish it. (I was probably still emerging from a really heavy Judy Blume phase at the time.) Even then I already had a true sense of loyalty of Tolkien, thanks to that great animated cartoon I watched as a little kid. When I later read the trilogy in high school, it was far easier to immerse myself in Tolkien's writing. Though I love all of the books, by far my favorite is The Two Towers. I think it shows the most interesting character development (especially in Frodo, Samwise, and Gollum) and Tolkien's tactic of writing two separate storylines in one book is always exciting. Just when you finish one storyline and are left jonesing for the next installment, you realize there is an entire other half to the story you forgot about. Everyone knows the dramatic impact Tolkien's writing has had on modern literature (can you say Harry Potter?) but no one does it better.
