I loved this book and have passed it on to other friends! Thanks to Kristi for turning me on to this author.This is one of the best chick-lit books ever. The follow-up "Something Blue" was almost as good. The story focuses on two lifelong best friends, Rachel and Darcy. The first installment is told from Rachel's perspective; the second book is told from Darcy's perspective. Very clever.Rachel is the single, plain, thirtysomething, always a responsible good girl attorney. Something I can totally relate to except for the lawyer part! LOL. Darcy is the exact opposite - she is the outgoing, popular, pretty girl who is engaged to Dex.As the story unfolds, we learn that Rachel has known Dex since law school and has been in love with him for quite some time. And as luck would have it, Dex confesses his feelings for Rachel even though he is engaged to Darcy.Normally one might frown on such an affair, but Rachel's character is one that most of us can relate to and I for one was sympathetic. Rachel does suffer some immense feelings of guilt, but also learns a lot about herself, her history, and her friendship with Darcy.
