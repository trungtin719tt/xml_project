Oh my goodness! This is perhaps the king of true crime novels in one sense. Yet in another, it was hard to listen to the horrifying details of the crimes and the twisted philosophy of Charles Manson.Meticulous. I don't think there is a better way to describe this book written from the viewpoint of D.A Vincent Bugliosi who headed up the legal team during the trial. This book encompassed most of my walks for August/September. Yes, as I am wishing other walkers a great morning/evening, I listened to this narrative. Yeah, I am definitely strange!The book begins with the murders, then the investigation, no surprise that there are criticisms towards police officers, then there are the interviews, the backgrounds, the grand jury, the trial, the sentencing and finally in my Audiobook Bugliosi's reflection in 1994 about the continued appeal for the Manson family or more particularly it's creator, Charles Manson. As I mentioned earlier, there's a lot of content and some of its repetitive. I daresay that our narrator, Scott Brick, agrees with some of my fellow reviewers as there are times that V.B's arrogance does come across. There even times, there was an air of condescension, specifically, in terms of the legal system in California. However, I do have to admit, I am not a practicing legal expert and how could I possibly know that anyway.I do also come away with the continued "shaking of the head" about how susceptible men-whether police officers or lawyers fell for the "girls", especially "Sexy" Sadie. Who I believe, Bugliosi was more than a bit enamored by, perhaps not during the trial, but perhaps at lady during their first encounters. Dude, women can be just as violent as men. Then again, it was the 70's! Weren't all women believed to be delicate little flowers.Of course, the very centre of it all is Charles Manson. What a nut! I don't have much more to say than that.
