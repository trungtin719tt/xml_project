A warning to the reader, don't pick this book up if you cannot devote hours to reading it. You will be completely absorbed into this tale of a woman who happens to be a werewolf, and isn't completely happy about it. Elena is a fascinating protagonist, not all bad, but not all good either. She has an animal side to her that she has suppressed, but when dead bodies start turning up, killed by what is clearly a werewolf, she can no longer hide from her werewolf origins. Another thing that makes this book so fantastic is Clayton Danvers. That man is dangerous. You wonder how Elena can stay mad at him, although he really did her dirty (you have to read it to find out). The pack dynamics are interesting. As the only female werewolf, Elena is cherished like a beloved sister and daughter. But to Clay she is and will always be his mate, even if she runs away again. If you are looking for an urban fantasy book written like mainstream fiction, or a good fiction book that is very much urban fantasy, or a really incredible werewolf novel, you would probably just love this book.
