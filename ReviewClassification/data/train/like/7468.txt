Slyly captivating and insidiously disturbing. It's deceptively light conversational style (like the best of Stephen King) suckered me right in and before I knew it, pages flying by, I was deep into this masterfully written supernatural psychodrama, like M R James by way of Patricia Highsmith. A night-dark and utterly convincing depiction of a mind unravelling, leavened by genuine wit and compassion and made all the more compelling by a beautifully rendered central character who I couldn't help but be both captivated and appalled by. I felt quite nuts myself by the end! There are two absolutely gruesome moments (which I wont spoiler here) where I had to stop (I cant remember the last time I had to do that) and a gloriously insane WTF moment at the end. This is also a book of subtle richness that yields even more on a second, more measured, read. This book will stay with me for a looooooooong time.
