One of my managers at work actually reccomended this book to me after I told I had read 'The Road'. I have to admit that I was skeptical going into this book only because I knew some of the background due to publicity surrounding the movies. I didn't feel much like reading a bunch of quoted Bible scripture - but I was happy to discover that there wasn't much of that in the book.The story focuses primarily around a core group of characters all tied together following a mysterious worldwide disappearance of people. Each goes down there own path - and some find God while other are put under the spell of the anti-Christ.The beginning of the story was really riveting and had me hooked. SO many questions presented right away - and even though I knew the eventual answer the authors did a great job of present opposing and varied theories regarding the dissapearances. I wish I had more time to just sit down and read this book all at once but it got spaced out over about 2 weeks. The middle of the story had a bit of filler but the end of the book sucked me back in and left me wanting more. I have the second book on loan from my manager and I am going to try and squeeze it all in before I start my list of 100 Must Read Books. First book up - 'Slaughterhouse 5'.
