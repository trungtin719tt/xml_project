- George, wake up!- Ungh... what time is it?- I think about four am. You were having a nightmare.- Mmmn.- Hey, you're shaking. Come over here. It's alright. Do you want to tell me about it?- Ann Coulter and Satan jump into the void and pull him down with them. The evil archangel.- I'm sorry?- Ah, it doesn't make much sense, does it? But it did in the dream. It was even noble and tragic. I think.- What else happened?- Well, I know I shouldn't have stayed up reading that physics book. There was something about dark matter and angels. I think angels were dark matter? But they weren't dark when you looked at them in the right way. I built a sort of telescope and I could see them.- You should have come to bed with me. Remember that next time.- I will! And, ah, let me see, God lived in a Calabi-Yau manifold...- Awhat?- One of those twisty six-dimensional shapes that string theorists like. I showed you a picture, right?- Oh yes, now I know what you mean. So God's in his... whatever... and all is well with the world?- No, he's tired and he has some kind of accident. That was a good thing though.- You're still not making any sense.- I know, I know! And they can't ever see each other again. They're in different branes. That was so sad.- Different brains?- Branes. B-R-A-N-E-S. You know, parallel universes floating in multi-dimensional space. Anyway, he has to return to his brane and he's lost her forever.- George, try to go back to sleep. We'll be so tired tomorrow.- I just want to write this down before I forget it. It was really good. I think I could turn it into a book.- Tomorrow, George.- Okay, it'll wait until the morning. And you know what?- What?- I'm so glad we're in the same space-time continuum.- Oh George, that's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me!- Heh. I thought you'd like it. Goodnight sweetheart.- Goodnight George.- Mm.- Mm.
