This book rocked my world. It was startling and surprising in all the right ways. Shawn Michals, the protagonist of Peller's "To Live" trilogy finds himself on an island and confronted by a mysterious woman. The events that unfold are strikingly similar to what's going on in many countries these days. At times it's a bit derivative of "Steppenwolf," but still this book stands on its own. It's actually a refreshing, deeper, darker look at humanity than the previous "To Live" books. Home run, Peller.
