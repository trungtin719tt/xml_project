I still think I was too young when I read this.. I think I was about eleven, and this is surely not a lecture for a kid. Still, after all these years, the expressionQuo vadis, Domine?remains embroidered into my brain, with no way of escaping. I don't know why it made such a great impression on me, but I do believe that this is must-read for everyone, a great classic in world literature.
