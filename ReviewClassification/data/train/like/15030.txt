W. T. Ever. Loving. Holy. F.I mean... Bloody hell!That ending!?!?Holy smokin' balls... I'm speechless.I am unbelievably happy that I have book #4 ready to go. I would be so pissed right now if I didn't have access to the next book in this series immediately. This installment really kicked up this series for me.Mac is finally coming into her own and I'm loving that evolution. Barrons is still an alpha-hole mystery. (And I love that.) The tension between the two of them is so thick you can barely breathe at times. Seriously... I was actually holding my breath during one of their interactions.Though I think I know where Barrons mystery identity is going, I'm not ruling anything out at this point... I mean, the whole world was just turned upside down. Fantastic read... immediately on to the next one!
