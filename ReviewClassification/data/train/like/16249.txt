I really liked the book, my main problem with it is Rick's selection of POV's!!! Percy, Annabeth, Frank and Hazel felt like side characters in comparison of Jason, Piper and Leo. I think that this book needed the POV of the seven demigods, but oh well...PS: I loved Nico in this book, my baby was so awesome. ALSO... SOLANGELO &lt;3.
