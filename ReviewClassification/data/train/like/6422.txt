Most people would list the Catcher In the Rye as the ultimate coming of age story, but I beg to differ. For me, my coming of age book was A Separate Peace. It was required reading - we were not given a choice on reading it. Unlike prior assigned reading books, I actually READ this one.I wish I could remember more of it.What I do remember was that I liked it. It's about a boy growing up at a prep school, making friendships and planning futures provided the war ends and that they aren't all drafted when they are of age. During the process the boy builds a friendship with someone much unlike him that gets him into troubles and hijinks and they have times where it is difficult between them, but they grow to be very close. Eventually, this friend goes in for some sort of surgical procedure, something that is supposed to be simple. And like that, he dies on the table of a freak complication. The boy is then forced to look into things beyond his limited scope and he must deal with the fallout of the death.When I read this, I didn't know that something similar to this would happen to myself later. It's something that while not identical, it does mirror personal experience. It's a sad story, but one worth reading. It's on my shelf at present and I've been meaning to read it again to see if it still is as good as I remember it, but with all of these new books, it's hard to make time for one I've already read. Still, I give it high marks and a personal recommendation.
