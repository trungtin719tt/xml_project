I can't wait! This book is going to rock! I hope that the 'sacrifice' isn't Rose's life, soul, or baby( if she gets pregnant - which I think is a 50% chance that it could happen) I am obbsesed with these books I can't believe 'The Last Sacrifice' is the last Vampire Academy book ( or so they say- who knows maybe in a few years she ( Richelle Mead) will write a new series that continues VA) I am absolutly positive that I will cry when VA's series ends ( who won't) God if Dimitri and Rose don't get their happy ending I will die. I mean Rose went through all that in the series for nothing, I don't think so....( I didn't mean to sound bitchy if I did or be a spoiler or party pooper) thanks and I hope u all love the last two books of VA!
