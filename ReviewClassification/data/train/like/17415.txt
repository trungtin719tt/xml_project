I finished this last night. At about 1:30 in the morning. Honestly, I have no idea how to even begin a review for this book. I kind of have the same panicky feeling I had when people would see me reading and ask what this book was about. I started blurting out incomplete sentences and even stammering all the while. I knew there was no way I could convey the brilliance of this book in just a couple light-conversational sentences. I think that might be the same case here, so my apologies in advance.Okay, I've been sitting here for awhile trying to get my thoughts together, and I realized I'll have to get the book out and go over the insane amount of notes I took while reading this to make any sense. And while I've gotten pretty good at pretending to work while I'm actually playing around on Goodreads, I'm notthatgood...yet.I think I went through an entire thing of Post-Its, that are now sticking out of the book every which way covered with crazy quotes and questions. (Here, I'll sneak a pic for a visual aid)I don't think I've ever gotten so involved in a story before. Frantically taking notes, decoding a 3 page letter, and getting out of bed at midnight last night to play a sequence of notes on the piano...it really made me identify with Johnny's obsession. This book really isn't one of those supernatural/gory/monster horror novels, but more of a oh-my-god-I'm-losing-my-mind horror, which to me is one of the scariest things of all.
