What hasn't been said about Jane Austen? Not only is she arguably the greatest female writer of all time, she is also arguably one of the greatest writers of all time. She is in the same status as Shakespeare and Dickens. Chances are you've heard her name if you are a reader. I still think she is important to English literature as well as the language.I was never really fond of Austen before reading her books. For the longest time I thought she was either this snooty bitchy writer or she was chick-lit that attracted hopeless romantics. After watching Becoming Jane and actually reading her books, I was proven wrong. I fell in love with Austen's writing. She's not my favorite author, but I now have a better understanding of her works. Kind of proves the point that you shouldn't have critical thoughts about authors you've never read before. Sometimes you're right, but most of the time you are wrong.One thing I've kept saying while reading this massive book was about Austen's writing. I was kind of blown away by it all. She can write. Her vocabulary is quite impressive. It's as if she is carefully picking the words she writes rather than writing a book with a silly plot that doesn't make any sense. It's also impressive that she was a bestseller at her time, let alone being a woman writer. Maybe sometime in the distant future I'll have to reread this book again.My Top 7 (There are only 7 books in this collection by the way)1.Northanger Abby2.Emma3.Pride and Prejudice4.Mansfield Park5.Persuasion6.Sense and Sensibility7.Lady SusanNOTE: I wrote some individual reviews of each book if you are interested on there pages.
