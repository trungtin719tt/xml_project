Well, that was such a pretty incredible conclusion of the Vampire Academy series!I waited for months before I readLast Sacrificebecause I grew really fond of this series since I started it and I hate the separation anxiety I always get whenever I read a final book of a series that I love.THIS IS WHAT I AM SAYING. I hate this feeling. This bittersweet feeling because it's finallyOVER. No more Rose, Dimitri, and Adrian moments. No more snarky and entertaining narration from the world's most badass fictional heroine. THAT'S IT.But you know the good thing?I really had funwith this series! It's because it really had me invested in the characters.Last Sacrificeis one of the best series-enders I've read so far. It's adrenaline-pulling and full of actions. It's also fast-paced, unlike the previous books which are a little dragging. I also love the mystery involved in this book. The killer of the important character was finally unveiled here, and guess what my reaction after finding out who the culprit behind?It was mind-blowing!There were also more revelations other than the murderer. And I was also introduced to the other side of the vampire world. I did not know there were such people like theKEEPERS. There were also more involvements fromSydneyandThe Alchemists. And yes,Abe Mazur FTW!And did I sayLissa'scharacter really improved here?I love everything here in this book, I just wished there was a different kind of ending between Rose and Adrian. It did not sit well with me. I love that boy and it pained me so much when their final coversation happened like that.BIG OUCH.To Adrian Ivashkov...Well at least I still haveBloodlinesand I am very excited to find out his story andSydney's.Rating: 4 Stars
