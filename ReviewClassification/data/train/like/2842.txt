Come on Grinch,Don't be a spoilsport.I and my wife are surely reading to our little Who's when they are born.The undercurrent of the story presents to you a question as to not "How" but rather "Why" did the the Grinch stole the Christmas from the merry making Who people.Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lotBut the Grinch who lived just North of Whoville did not!The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.But I think that the most likely reason of allMay have been that his heart was two sizes too small.He loathes the idea of celebration and fun. Sweets and light and everything associated with the near end of December.Grinch is like that Grumpy old catJust outside the perimeters of the happy village of our little people, lives in a cave The Grinch. Old, unhappy and nasty. He plans to hijack the opportunity from the Whoville to sayMerry Christmasto each other.Slowly and stealthily (and yes, sometimes not so STEALTHILY) starts taking away candies, sweets, gifts and the decorations. He relishes a sadistic joy in his heart and tugs all the happiness of the festival in his dark cave.However things do not turn out as planned.And he realizes what's in fact true.The moral message that it sends out - in this ever twisting, looping and cannon balling style of writing - is that the joy is not only materialistic. It's much profounder than that.Change in heart and the mettle to accept your shortcomings along with the trademark rhyming scheme of Dr. Seuss makes it a book that you simply can't rate less than 5.The warmth in your heart can kindle about the coldest of woods.
