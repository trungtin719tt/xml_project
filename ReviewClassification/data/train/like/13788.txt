It was fate that this book and I would eventually converge, I think. My writing program friends from school -- namelyKyleand the girl who started the extra curricular writing group I was a part of for two years -- frequently gushed about John Irving. My bookish aunt devoured all of his older works in high school. I made an attempt to readA Widow for One Yearmy freshman year of college and it left me cold, for as much as I trust those tastes. I felt little drive to ever pick him up again.Then, in the span of a week: I found enthusiastic reviews of Irving's work on Ask Metafilter, my other go-to book recommendation source (really, read their book recommendation posts, so good). My friendSnotchocheezmailed me his copy, a blind response to my "send whatever you think I should read!" suggestion as an exchange forHouse of Holes(sorry, I think you lost on that one, bud). Shortly after receiving the book from him, I was out to a rare-these-days in-town lunch withsmoreads, who said, "You know what I just read that was great?The Hotel New Hampshire." CREEPY.So thank you, little world of friends and Internet, for conspiring to get me to retry John Irving. Tens of people can't be wrong! If I were the type to pound down the works of an author I discovered I love in succession, I'd probably do that right now.The Hotel New Hampshirereminds me, in the best way, ofMiddlesex. It precedes that book by over two decades and doesn't have quite the uniqueness of voice of Calliope Stephanides, but it shares similar, uh, motifs. It's this big, bold, comic family tragedy that's so unbelievable, but not entirely beyond the realm of plausibility, that Irving has to keep reminding us that "everything is a fairy tale". It was exactly what I wanted to read right now.And let me just say, Irving looks pretty normal and non-pervy in pictures, but this book is chock-full of uncomfortable sex in almost every way sex can be uncomfortable. It's kind of hilarious to me to flip back to the author's picture and think of what is swirling around in that brain of his to cause thatsmirky smile. (Spoiler: it's bear sex.)
