As an amateur astronomer and mathematician, I went looking for this book, or any book about Hypatia. There aren't many which is understandable because unlike our big female historical heroes: Cleopatra, Elizabeth the First, and so forth, there's little we know about this woman thanks to her total eradication by the early Christian church. So both novelists as well as scholars have to piece together a human being out of very little indeed. And every one of them has their bias. A bit like: who was Shakespeare? Blood gets shed over that question. Anyway, having already read and loved Longfellow'sThe Secret Magdalene, I was prepared for a piecing together like no other. And this is what I got. A unique viewpoint and an immersion into a fascinating Hypatia and a fascinating world. Longfellow has an amazing ability to synthesize what she knows and what she surmises. She also is a first rate novelist. Killer combo.I've read somewhere (a mathematics site?) that there isn't enough pure math here. Being somewhat well versed in math myself, I know two things: there is no pure math,, and if there were, it would not have existed in Hypatia's time. Historians like to think she was one of the first of the moderns, but first what? Mathematics on its highest level is a language spoken by very few and has NO practical application. I'm not talking the kind of math that allows an engineer to design an airplane or a building. I'm talking about mathematical problems that exist only for and of themselves. Hypatia's mathematics had enormous practical application, even if that application was alchemy.Great book. And one must remember she was also a philosopher. Longfellow's grasp of philosophy still impresses me.
