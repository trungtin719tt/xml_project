I did not like this book.I started reading it at about 3pm in the afternoon and finished at about 9:30. When I finished I sat there, stunned. In awe.It is one of the best Young Adult novels I've ever read. One of the best novels I've ever read, if we're going to go there, too. It was, in a word, flawless.How can you "like" flawless? How can you "love" it? DIVERGENT is powerful. It is moving. It is extraordinary. My only regret? That the whole world hasn't read it yet, because my need to talk about it is so fierce that I barely want to do anything else.
