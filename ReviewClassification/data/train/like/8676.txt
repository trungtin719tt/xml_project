The Republic is where Plato lays down his ideas of an ideal state and its rulers. Plato's Utopian state is one which is just and his ideal rulers are philosophers (so far as I understood). Being my first philosophic read, I don't claim to have fully understood Plato's ideas.Presented as a series of dialogue between Socrates and Plato's brothers Adeimantus and Glaucon, in eleven parts Plato step by step forms his ideal state (Part I and II), its rulers (Part IV and Part VII), their education, women's position (Part VI) and the position of art and poetry (Part X) in the new state. Although some of his views are far fetched and absurd, many of them are thought provoking. And if you examine carefully, you will see the truth of many of his view points, especially those relating to imperfect societies (discussed in Part IX).I really enjoyed Plato arguments although I cannot say that I agree with them all. There are many insightful views though at the same time, given the long years between the time in which it was written and which it was read, some of the arguments are absurd according to modern standards. Plato's Utopian state is one that cannot be realized in reality; even Plato had his doubts about it ever being in existence. But on close examination on various governance in the world we see instances where views of Plato having been adopted. Taking all these into account, it is no wonder that the Republic is regarded as the cornerstone of western philosophy.The translation I read was done by Sir Desmond Lee. I found it easy to read. There were many explanatory notes within that really helped me to understand the text, although I cannot say I fully understood everything.Overall, I loved the read, and am really happy to say that finally one of my long reading wishes is fulfilled.
