I've just now read this classic, a long way out of Christmas season, and discovered it was a lot more amusing than the film and the cartoon adaptations, which were until today my only sources of knowledge about the plot. It's much simpler than both, more focused on children, and devoid of the superfluous romantic elements the Jim Carrey film had. Definitely better! And with a clearer message.
