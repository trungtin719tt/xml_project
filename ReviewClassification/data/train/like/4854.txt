This is the second in Longfellow's trilogy of gnosis. This time she's chosen an extraordinary woman's whose history is sketchy at best but who she has given the role of a seeker rather than, as with Mary Magdalene (The Secret Magdalene: A Novel, a finder. Spiritual quests are at the bottom of these first two "historic" novels and I love them for two reasons. First, that the subject is treated in a novelists way rather than as some sort of "self-help" book is just up my street. And secondly, I think Longfellow may just be a great American writer. I don't know if we think that way anymore but I do know we laud writers I can't abide. But that's just me, no doubt. Academics and Oprah know better. This book takes us into the heart and mind of a woman who stands so far above her fellow man she would and is called a genius. But in Longfellow's hands she's still very very human and as heroic as any man in any field. The writing is superb. The understanding of her topic makes me suspect Longfellow really knows what she's talking about. Big favorite.
