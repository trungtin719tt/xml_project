Why did I wait so long to read these?I have no good explanation and if you ask me I'll just give you the shifty eyes and mumble something incoherent because I don't have a good reason. What counts though is that I am reading them now right? On the upside I don't have to agonize for the long wait for new books to come out, but still... if I had just known!So as expected Percy's summer is going to be filled with another quest and yet another colossal problem that brings him closer to the prophecy. This time around Annabeth is in charge of the quest and they will have to find Daedalus, the creator of the Labyrinth, to stop Kronos from attacking Camp Half-Blood. Of course the Labyrinth is no regular maze. It shifts and deceives and there are a butt-load of monsters on every corner. In the mix we have Rachel Dare who we meet briefly in the last book, and she will play a major role here. We get to see what Nico is up to, and I gotta say I really liked him in this one. Can Percy, Annabeth, Grover, and Tyson solve the maze in time to find Daedalus before Luke does?There is this one scene where Percy is alone and contemplating a tough decision he has to make and I took a little sniff and thought,"Aww.. Percy is growing up."Just like they all are. Things are getting to be more dangerous and we are getting nearer to the climax. More pieces of the puzzle are being presented and Riordan is being crafty just like a good storyteller would be. I actually can't fathom how he keeps up with all of it. All these gods, monsters, and plot-lines to follow; truly great stuff.As you can tell I'm totally pumped to read the last book which Iknowwill not disappoint.The Last Olympianhere I come!
