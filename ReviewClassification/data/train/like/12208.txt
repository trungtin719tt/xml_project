This one is a re-read for me. My husband had never read it so, I decided to "buddy" read this one with him. It has been years since I read this book, but I still remembered many of the details. I really love these first few books in the series. I started to read lukewarm reviews after the third one and I quit reading them, but I see there is a new installment and I'm a little curious as to what Odd has been up to lately.This is one of Koontz' best characters in my opinion. Odd is just so loveable and tormented and sweet and sad and conflicted all at the same time.If you don't read any other Dean Koontz novels or series, try this one out.
