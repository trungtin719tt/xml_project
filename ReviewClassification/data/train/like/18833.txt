4.5. I was really surprised by the book. It was the 2007 debut of Allen and for being the first book she has a good imagination. She reminds me of Alice Hoffman with her magic and story telling in a Southern fashion. It was a love story mixed with family miscommunications, a magical garden and physical abuse that breaks your heart and makes you smile at the same time. Sweet and enchanting... related to the characters and cheered them on til the very end... Very girly read but it was a good in between before I start reading something more serious.
