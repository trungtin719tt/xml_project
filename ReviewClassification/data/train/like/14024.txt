I enjoyed reading this book when I was in my early 20s, but only re-reading it in my 50s have I realized what a wonderful novel "Dandelion Wine" is, what an amazing evocation of summer in a small town. The summer evoked is 1928, but it could almost as easily be 1948 or 1968 as well. The book paints a picture of a time when one walked or took a trolley around town, talked with friends and family on a large front porch, had a soda or ice cream at a drugstore fountain, and listened to grandfathers and grandmothers tell tales of other worlds and earlier eras. The book, visiting many of the residents of Green Town, Ill., is a mixture of colorful writing, nostalgia and -- not really "magical realism." Rather, realistic magic, the literary display through the eyes of childhood wonder of the miracles of everyday life that we almost always overlook as adults.
