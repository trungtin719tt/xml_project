I loved the book Anne of Green Gables so much. I enjoyed this book, but it did not have the same impact on me that the first one did. There was much about this book that I loved, but I did miss Anne as a child. She is becoming an adult, a better adult than most.I did love the hilarious things the children said. I mean they were things I could hear any child saying. Davey was a little crazy. That kid has some sociopathic tendencies. Still, he was so funny. He enjoyed causing some excitement around that place. It was pretty amazing. Davey's poor sister though was so boring even the adults thought she was boring.Paul was another good student. I liked him. He was very Anne-like. The children were the highlight of the book. Lucy Montgomery really know how to write children. It is her gift.Anne is a teacher at like 16 going on 17. She teaches for one year before she is going on to college. This is the year that the book covers. She is a young teacher. She also doesn't want to squash the imagination and hopes of children. She wants to befriend them instead of corporeal punishment. That is funny too as everyone keeps telling her to beat the children.I thought the book was a little long in places and the story dragged a little. I am also used to a faster pace thanks to modern literature. It's nice to slow down the pace of story and read something different. Still, the language does cast a spell and Prince Edward Island seems magical.I look forward to reading the next one. This is a wonderful series.
