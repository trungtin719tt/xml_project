This book was really sad. The fact that it was a real story made it way sadder. At one point when i was reading the part about the bathroom and mirror treatment, i almost cried. I can't believe that anyone would do such things to their own flesh and blood.If i was David, i would have tried to run away or tell somebody at my school of the things that were happening at home.The person that i actually hated more that the mother in the book was David's father.How can you sit around watching a sick person torture your son and not do anything? Even if he was scared of the mother, he could have anonymously called the police and report that a boy was being abused.I'm glad that he finally got away from his mother.
