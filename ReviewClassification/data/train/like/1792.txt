Passing Through the Human Passions"...Let him first cast a stone at her"I read this Tolstoy masterpiece for the first time five years ago, coming to it with a cynicism formed by my mistaken impression that it was simply about Anna Karenina's terminal adulterous affair and her despicable selfishness toward her son. I thought the novel would, no doubt, effectively demonstrate the tragic consequences of self-centeredness and the absence of a moral compass. Beyond that, I was a cynic.My skepticism was misguided. While Anna K's affair with Count Vlonsky is the primary tale being told, this must be viewed within the context of the novel's three other relationships to appreciate the purified beauty of this masterwork.Both of the Russian Giants (Tolstoy and Dostoevsky) sculpt consistently around themes ofthe relationship between a husband and a wife;a human's relationship to and with God;the mortal struggles--of faith versus doubt, and--of monogamy and morality versus free will and the pleasures of the flesh; and,below the firmament, the ongoing and infinite war between the forces of good and evil.These themes are arguably nowhere more breathtakingly composed for study, contemplation and interpretation for all time, by scholars, thinkers, students and lovers of literature, than in this transcendent tragedy.Anna Karenina's illicit romance with the younger, adonic Count Vronsky is mainscreen. I recall seeing an article shortly after reading this novel revealing that Tolstoy began with the idea of making a fallen married woman, condemned for her actions, sympathetic to readers for her human weaknesses and her lot in life (or something to this effect). He wanted to test Jesus' admonition in the Bible to those about to stone to death a woman caught having sexual relations outside her marriage: "He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her." John 8:7, KJV.In addition to the eponymous affair, the novel also follows:^ The verecund, thinking farmer Levin and his courtship of and marriage to the gorgeous, shallow and vestal Kitty (who was once infatuated with Vronsky);^ The mired uxorial partnership between Anna's brother, the unsteady, unfaithful social-hound Stiva Oblonsky and his loyal wife Dolly (Kitty's sister), who is the exemplary, unappreciated mother of his children, and who finds herself having muliebral daydreams of a scorching affair of body and soul with another man; as well as,^ Anna's relationships with her controlling, cuckolded husband Karenin and with her poor, innocent son.Tolstoy created this stunningly gorgeous mindtrip over a terrain he drew in a way that would emotionally drain the reader* and provoke her thoughts and feelings such that she might find an obscure piece of her soul revealed.In my opinion, this is the best novel ever written.*Given my harsh criticism of the novel,a little lifebyHanya Yanagihara, as...let's just say...Emotionally Sadistic (by Author Admission), and lengthy discussions I've had about that novel, I should say here that there is a HUGE difference between writing a novel/story with the express intent of inflicting emotional pain on the reader (as the author ofa little lifehas repeatedly admitted and as is evident in the way it's written) and composing a novel that is truthful to the human condition and shows a character in a fallen married woman who Tolstoy wanted to portray in a light sympathetic to readers, testing the Christian admonition about casting the first stone.Let me explain further. Anna Karenina is sad. A suicide seemed the most likely outcome under the circumstances, as it did ina little life. The difference is in the verisimilitude in the former and the lack thereof in the latter. For example, the events leading up to the suicide were not beaten into you overandover and over and overandover. InAnna Karenina, by comparison, the delineation of the terrible circumstances never became gratuitous, grating, annoying, patently manipulative as quickly happened ina little life. I don't believe one can overemphasize the author's statement that when she began writinga little life, sheset out to write a novel that would inflict as much emotional pain as she could manage upon the book's readers..I invite, with honorable intentions, Goodreads friends (and readers) to give me examples of acclaimed novels for which the author said something to the effect that when he/she began writing the novel with the idea and purpose of tormenting its readers.
