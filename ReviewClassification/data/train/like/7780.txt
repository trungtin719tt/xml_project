I have the feeling there's more than one way of looking at this book. On one hand it can be viewed as abildungsroman, it follows Michael Berg since the age of 15 till full maturity. On the other hand, it's the post-war German generation coming to terms with their past, the Nazi crimes and their parents' guilt. Guilt, actually, is a recurring theme in the novel: Hanna is guilty of war crimes, Michael is guilty for betrayal (plus he feels guilty for having loved Hanna and asks himself if that makes him a criminal as well), Michael's father for not being enough of a father.The question you get stuck with, after reading, is Hanna's question addressed to the judge: "What would you have done?"The question I am stuck with is: What would have happened if the truth had been told?On a bohemian level, the novel is about love for books and reading, so that's a plus for bookworms :)
