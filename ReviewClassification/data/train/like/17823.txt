I first heard of H. P. Lovecraft as a pre-teen growing up in Lovecraft's own hometown, Providence RI. At an overnight (AKA sleep away) camp, the counselor in our cabin read "bed time stories" from Weird Tales.Lovecraft could be found in the card catalogue of the Providence Public Library, but the books were not circulated... at least to youngsters.Perhaps it was the horror aspect to his stories, but, remember, this was also a time when Hardy Boys or Nancy Drew mysteries were considered "appropriate" literature for young minds.If you want a detailed rundown of the book's contents, I refer you to Apopkipos's inclusive review.Lovecraft has achieved a fame he could probably not have fathomed! Among his fans is Joyce Carol Oates, one of the premier prose writers of late 20th century America. Of Lovecraft's 70 tales, she has made a selection as well as an insightful introduction.Of the many collections and anthologies, hers is my favorite.(For a lengthier appreciation, a lengthier essay that appeared in the NY Times Review of Books is available online.)
