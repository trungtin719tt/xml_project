5 stars toC.S. Lewis'sThe Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe. Adored it. I must have read it three or four times as a child. Hits all the spots in my reading dreams. a forest. A large family. Talking animals. Secrets. Mystery. Drama. Hidden messages. Saga and series. Every child should read it.Imagination runs free here. 4 children stuck a house. 1 goes exploring and finds herself lost in the world of Narnia. And the rest follow her.Siblings fight. The book shows what happens when you don't listen to one another.Aslan, the hero lion, helps show what sacrifice is all about. Good stuff.I spent many a days looking for the secret world hidden somewhere in my closets. While I never actually transported to another world, this book is like its own Narnia - a transport into something magical.
