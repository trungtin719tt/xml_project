Are you a White? Do you want to understand how it was for Blacks, particularly those who are poor, in the States, in the 30s and 40s and of course before that too? This book is set in Chicago. You read it to climb into the skin of a Black. It is not pleasant, but it is revealing. Do you dare?The book description just does not get across the most important aspect of the book: you will be in Bigger's skin, and this is scary. As I noted below, for much of the book you will be sitting on the edge of your seat. You will need to stop, pause, get a breath of air to go on.I was totally thrilled with the book and its message.... until the end, until the court proceedings. The closing speeches of both the defense lawyer and the state attorney were both long-winded and not believable. The defense lawyer's was too theoretical, not to the point; the author should have been able to do better. The state attorney's speech would have to have been interrupted by the judge! No way could he have said what he said. Nope, here the writing could have been improved. The author was almost lecturing the reader, hammering in his message all too clearly. This book was really amazing, until almost the very end. It is still very good though.The narration of the audiobook by Peter Francis James was f-a-n-t-a-s-t-i-c!! Superb. Outstanding. He can imitate Black women singing, newspaper reporters, radio announcements; he did everybody perfectly.DO read this book!!! Or listen to it.***********************************After Book One, so still just at the very beginning:I have begun. What a book!!! Do you want a book with suspense, one that will have you sitting on the edge of your seat from the start AND one that has/had an important message AND one that is perfectly executed? Every word is simple but perfect. I am scared with every move. I understand that Bigger is dangerous. Dangerous, not with evil intent, but from fear. And the white girl's total incomprehension makes me hate her more than even Bigger could hate her. What happens is NOT Bigger's fault; it is Mary's, the daughter of Bigger's new white employer. See the book description; this is not a spoiler. Did I say this was suspenseful? It is also heartrending. I DO understand that Mary is young and naive. She too has only good intentions.*******************************I will reread this too. Ralph Ellison (Invisible Man) and Richard Wright were friends. This time I will listen. Narration by Peter Francis James is available at Audible and Downpour, and it is supposed to be good.Will I still give this four stars on my second reading?
