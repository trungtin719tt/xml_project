Another wonderful book from Longfellow who wroteThe Secret Magdalene A Novel. This one is set in the 4th and 5th century in Alexandria Egypt when Christianity is the state religion of Rome. But all over the Empire Hellenists still teach and ancient religions still compete for the minds of the people. Hypatia of Alexandria was one of the last of the great early mathematicians and hilosophers with complete access to what still remained of the Great Library of Alexandria. This is a fast racy tale of courage and ultimate tragedy, but with the same underlying profundity of Longfellow's Magdalene. The story is not as well known, in fact it's barely known at all. But it should be and I, for one, am so pleased that Longfellow in particular took it on. It's a huge story deserving of a huge audience and has everything a reader of historical fiction could want. As for those who love good writing and philosophy beautifully told, this is here too.
