My sister recommended this book to me and even bought me a copy at half price day at Goodwill. Now I am recommending this book to you.The main character, Ella, is a young woman, almost 15, who is cursed with obedience as an infant. A fairy thinks she's blessing the baby by forcing her to be obedient, but that's not really how it turns out. Imagine being physically compelled to doanythingthatanyonetells you to do. You don't have to be an anarchist to quickly realize that would be a rotten way to live.Thankfully, Ella is intelligent, clever, witty, and gifted with languages.After a family tragedy, the previously sheltered Ella is forced out into the world where she goes on a quest to find the fairy who cursed her and ask for relief from her burden.Two-thirds of the way through, the book becomes the retelling of the classic Cinderella story. At first I was nervous that the great beginning of the book would be ruined by this quirky turn, but it actually worked out really well.Gail Carson Levine is a gifted writer, and I enjoyed this story immensely. I recommend this book for little girls and really anyone all into "someday my prince will come" and "happily ever after." This feisty heroine will be an inspiration to everyone who reads her story
