Does it matter if the wonderful rhythms, imagery, and syntax in the language of this book are authentically Welsh? I would like to believe they are, but Llewellyn was not who he claimed to be--that much is known. His parents were Welsh, but he was born in England. Internet searches turn up many references to the Oscar winning 1941 film, but very few about the book itself.I loved the language and it made the book for me. The characters (and their environs) arefictional--a bildungsroman that held my attention, made me laugh, and even brought a few tears. It addresses a boys thoughts on the exploitation of the environment, workers, and women. The book is worth a read if just to follow his sex education in a rigidly old testament culture.
