Reading Jack London's White Fang was beyond any expectation. The manner by which he has so vividly written in an animal's point of view leads one to incredulous experiences and conclusions while wholly experiencing the enthralling story. I'm almost inclined to argue - with an implausible idea - that London is white fang himself experiencing firsthand all that he has written. This statement does not render absurdity but rather should be further taken as an evidence giving credence that London's White Fang has perfectly captured the wolf experience, however fictitious it may be. I did not give it however a perfect five star rating due to the manner by which it is written as short as it is, that in itself is not even a flaw but a matter of personal preference. White Fang is surely a must read.
