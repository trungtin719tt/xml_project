Sherlock Holmes and the case of the Killer Mormons!But more about that later...Ok, the big deal about this one is that you get to see the Sherlock/Watson meet-cute. I mean, this is one of the most important meetings in the history of all literature! Come on, people! Get excited!It's only fair to mention that I've read and reread all of these stories a bjillion times, and these are by far my favoriteclassiccharacters.Well, except for Lizzie &amp; Mr. Darcy...But I know I haven't read P&amp;P as many times as I have Sherlock's mysteries, which should tell you something right there.I LOVE YOU, SHERLOCK!And, just to be clear, I loved him before he was all sexified.Ok, so Watson is back from the war (he basically just got trounced on and then came home), andhas wasted all of his moneyis running low on funds. Luckily, he runs into an old pal from school, who just happens to know of this guy who's looking for a roommate. One thing leads to another, and the next thing you know, Felix &amp; Oscar have found their forever home!Alright, as far as themysterygoes, it's just Sherlock running around sniffing things, (implausibly) being able to identify cigar ash, and tracing the movement of criminals using day-old (tromped on) footprints.Given what we know about forensic evidence now, is any of this,in any small way, even remotely believable? Can Sherlock actuallydeductthe answer to this mystery from horse tracks, a dead man's bad breath, and a plain wedding band?You're goddamn right, he can!So...WhoDoneIt?Now, I'm fully prepared to admit that I had forgotten about the Mormon Connection. I haven't read this oneyears, mostly because I prefer the short stories.Duh!But, to uncover the reasons behind the killings, Doyle takes us on a journey to the wilds of America! Specifically, Utah.Land of the Magic Underwear!This was where the tale of one man's thirst for vengeance was born. And it's all Brigham Young's fault. He was eeeeeeevil!Bwahahahahaha!I'm assuming that Mormonism (like most religions) has its share of shady skeleton's in the closet. Now, I don't claim to be an expert on these guys. And I don't personally know very many Mormons, due to their predilection for Salt Lake City. All I know about that religion is what I've seen on tv or read in books, and it's not much.They wear special underwear. They can't watch R-rated movies. And they used to go door-to-door, until the Jehovah's Witness got to be too much competition.There's something else I'm forgetting though... What is it? It's right there on the tip of my tongue.Is it that they write best selling novels about sparkly vampires?No, there was something that looked like a big pink elephant...Oh! I remember!Yes. Well, from what I can tell, the only Mormons who practice polygamy now are fringe groups that are more or less shunned by their peers.And while I'm not on board with any religion, I doubt that this one is much weirder than most, at this point anyway. Plus, at least most Mormons seem to be pretty educated and well-off. It's not like Salt Lake City is one huge trailer park filled with toothless hillbillies. And (bonus!) they seem to have the sense to keep their crazy old people off the airwaves...Or so I thought! Now that I've read this, I'm going to have to rethink my plan to move west! Who knew these guys were so devious!?Kidnapping, forced marriage, murder, and secret bird calls!?Was this really a five star book?Fuck, no. But it's my favorite character's first book, and I enjoyed the hell out of it.Buddy read with my Non-Crunchy Friends!
