As always after reading such a density, it is a bit of a friend left on the road. Dickens himself will admit to having had difficulty in quitting David Copperfield after such a long intimacy!This novel is, he says in the preface, his favorite, and when he has to read an extract in front of an audience, a few years later, the choice of this extract is anguishing because this novel is a whole, a set of entangled narratives one in the other that can not be separated without breaking the fabric of the work.It is also that this novel is very personal and that Dickens has put a lot of it in this character! On this point, the notes are captivating.But when I say that I just left a friend here or should I specify "a bunch of friends," which is especially Copperfield custodian of ups and downs.David Copperfield, aged about 40, turns to his past, a long, quiet river at a time when he will meet the Peggoty, brother and sister Murdstone, Emily, Steerforth, his aunt, Agnes , the Micawber and finally Dora of which he will become mad lover.To enumerate the characters who will follow David in his journey - good, bad, sometimes both - I retrace in my head the thread of the story and I say to myself: what way made!Dickens is a fine storyteller who is not afraid to throw away from time to time some information about the future of the narrator keeping us in suspense for the nevertheless seven hundred pages that follow, not hesitating to add a good dose of humor to some dramatic scenes, and a tender love when death is involved.It was the little David, the orphan, who most moved me, but I give my affection to Mr. Peggoty, to Agnes, and of course to David's aunt who will change completely when she opens the door to a poor vagrant child.It is also a sometimes pathetic portrait of industrial England and finally an almost cinematographic work that inspired the greatest of the years that followed its publication.Goodbye David!
