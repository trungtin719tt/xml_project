I had a guinea golden;I lost it in the sand,And though the sum was simple,And pounds were in the land,Still had it such a valueUnto my frugal eye,That when I could not find itI sat me down to sigh.I had a crimson robinWho sang full many a day,But when the woods were paintedHe, too, did fly away.Time brought me other robins,--Their ballads were the same,--Still for my missing troubadourI kept the "house at hame."I had a star in heaven;One Pleiad was its name,And when I was not heedingIt wandered from the same.And though the skies are crowded,And all the night ashine,I do not care about it,Since none of them are mine.My story has a moral:I have a missing friend,--Pleiad its name, and robin,And guinea in the sand,--And when this mournful ditty,Accompanied with tear,Shall meet the eye of traitorIn country far from here,Grant that repentance solemnMay seize upon his mind,And he no consolationBeneath the sun may find.
