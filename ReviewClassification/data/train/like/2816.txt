I am unable to type properly due to an extreme amount of emotion going through me at the present time. I am also thoroughly angered by the fact there aren't more than 5 stars to fill in. I feel something like this:I will try and post up an actual review on my blog...once I get over my fangirling and that horrible mournful feeling that is associated with the fact that I have just realised that Four isn't real and I will never become a Dauntless and marry him.Real life sucks. Majorly.(Previous review before reading it)Super excited - Insurgent's nearly out!! I was reading the first few chapters that were released yesterday and I felt content, and I sat there thinking:Of course, I'm mainly reading it for Four (haha, very funny it rhymes):But, of course, people just have to rain on my parade and say "You know Four and Tris aren't going to last!"Listen guys: Four + Tris = Fourtris. Like a FORTRESS. Ever tried taking one of those down? Uh uh - I don't think so!I'm going to stop now, and go back to counting down the seconds until I get my hands on a copy of Insurgent!
