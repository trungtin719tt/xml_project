I've just put this book down and feel compelled to say something about it. I've been so long in the mind and world of the heroine (who has no name which took me a long time to notice), I feel like I'm still there. I'm seeing my own world as she saw hers. Creepy. This is one of those books that once you begin, and have to put it down for any reason, it calls to you: read me, read me, come back and read me. So you do even if reading it gets a little weirder by the page. It starts out so easily, so sadly, so normally. A woman at the end of the line, trying to come home. She's a writer still trying to write even though her life is in ruins all around her. But she believes she has one last book and so she gets a room in a hotel she loved as a child, and from there...well, from there you just follow her down and down and down or perhaps up and up and up. An extraordinary book, and perfectly written.
