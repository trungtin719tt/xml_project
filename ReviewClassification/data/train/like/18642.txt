Recommend through Postman, who described it as complementing the 1984-Brave New World discussion. He was right! D at N is about the hypocritical cycle of power, the failures of revolutions, and whether or not ends justify means. Rubashov is a sympathetic protagonist, which makes his own failures and complicity all the more engaging. The book is careful to never mention major historical figures or regimes by name - this isn't a book about how mean Stalin was. It's about how power will always be veiled as progress. It's about how thought is structured for those that lead.It's good! Ch-ch-ch-check it out.
