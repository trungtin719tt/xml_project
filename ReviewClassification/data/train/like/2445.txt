Thanks, Broadway street-book dude. Cowboys telling fart jokes and falling in love with sullen whores are EXACTLY what I want to read about right now.Warning: This book will destroy you. I have never been so completely and utterly decimated by a novel. I don't need a book club; I need a support group.On a side note: Maybe these are fightin' words, and I only ever readBlood Meridian, but I'll take McMurtry over McCarthy any day of the week. No Faulknerian pretensions, no torture-porn, no dogged insistence upon rendering the West as a nightmare-landscape of irredeemable violence and sorrow. McMurtry paints the West in more colors than red, creating a world as tawdry, savage, absurd, and beautiful as the Texas of my own memory.
