I truly enjoyed this classic, we get to see the how a wolf lives, and perhaps what they say and do and actLondon's writing is very different and unique, i loved how I could view the emotions pouring out of the pageWe journey with White Fang from the very start, from his birth, his puppyhood, the cruelty he faced and the encounters with humans and dogs tooWe even get a history of how his parents met and what they were likeWith White Fang we do on a self discovery adventure, and it was a delight to read, I enjoyed it immensely!This was the first book we read in our Reading Sprint Challenge for September 2018 (Buddy Reading Group)
