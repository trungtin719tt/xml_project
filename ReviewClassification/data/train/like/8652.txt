Finally, the last book I read in 2015. All caught up now.Pssst... You've read four books this year, so, like, you're, you know, still behind...FUCK!Anyballs, here we are, decades after this book was released and the movie adaptation gave baby boomers nightmares. I've never been a fan of books wherein faith beats the baddie. Seems the fallback method for lazy horror authors. I mean, why come up with your own means of annihilating the monster when you have all this religion laying around? Of course, in this book, it works. It works because religion is integral to the plot. I get that, so I'm cool with the denouement.I'm in awe of Blatty's ability to create atmosphere and tension with the silliest villain dialogue I've read. Normally when someone tells me my mother sucks cocks in hell, I'd just laugh it off, because according to my father, Mom doesn't do that. So joke's on you! Ha! Wait... Sorry. TMI? That shit with the crucifix in the cooze, though? That shit was horrifying. I don't have lady bits and cannot fathom taking a block of wood to my vahjayjay, but I imagine it'd be up there with getting kicked in the dangly bits. Yowch!Side question: Do you ladies feel it in your guts when you're curbstomped in the nu-nu? Does it feel like someone just falcon-punched your ovaries? Or is it more a localized pain? Sore lips, and all that? Because us guys feel it in our stomachs. Damn near all the way up to our sternums.Anyfuck, I dug this book. It was fun, gross, and didn't overstay its welcome. I'd definitely read the followup.In summation: If you've seen the director's cut of the movie adaptation and haven't read this book, you're not missing much. There's a lot more inner thought, as you'd expect from a novel, but overall the movie is a quicker way to absorb the same content, as the author is the one who wrote and directed the movie. Me? I prefer the book simply because I enjoy books.Final Judgment: More fun than a cross to the babymaker.
