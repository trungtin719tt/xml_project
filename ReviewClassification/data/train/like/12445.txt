After being a tiny bit disappointed by Book 6 I was very happy that this one was back up to standard! I have never been a great fan of Rehvenge but he turned into a much nicer character once under the influence of his Ehlena and I enjoyed their whole story.The side stories were the best though and the humour. I love the banter between the brothers and I really like Lassiter. I hope we hear a lot more of him in the future!As usual the book was a tad too long and it flagged a bit in the middle but then the whole Wrath story developed and that was intense and very sad.All very entertaining and of course there's a cliff hanger at the end to make sure I move on to the next book soon:)
