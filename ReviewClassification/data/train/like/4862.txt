When you love a book as much as I loved The Secret Magdalene, it's a hard act to follow. This book was so far above the common fodder that I should give it 5 stars but I can't because it didn't reach inside and rip my heart out. Although? Almost, at the end. It's not fair comparing one book to another, like the Academy Awards. Hypatia of Alexandria was a brilliant woman and this has all the flashes of brilliance I expect now from this writer. But it reads a little like an editor got hold of it and cut the philosophy and the mathematics. I'd like to know.
