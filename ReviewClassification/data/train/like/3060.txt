This was the first bookeverthat made me realize how cruel books can be.. the first book that made me sob and cry and wail and wanna chuck it against the wall and questionWHY?!But this was also the first book that I truly learned to cherish. This book will always have a spot in my heart. I need to own a copy. I haven't read this book since around 2000 and I think I'm ready to reread it now.BRING ON THE FEELS!
