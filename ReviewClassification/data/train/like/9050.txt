Solid 4 Stars!It's about time I started this series!!I won't waste time writing a review for a book/series that everyone but me seems to have read.I adored Cat and Bones. Their banter, chemistry, and humor was simply fabulous. I now understand why so many readers consider them their favorite paranormal couple. Even with the lame cliffhanger ending, which is no big deal considering the series is complete,Halfway to the Graveis a great start to what looks to be an awesome series.
