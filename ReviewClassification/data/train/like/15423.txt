"There's always someone who secretly believes in myths and legends."Beautiful, short book that kinda reminded me of a Disney movie but was an enjoyable read nonetheless.And of course, Tamani and Laurel were my favorite characters to read about in this story. David was an amazing best friend and should just stay that way :)
