THIS FIRST PART WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN IN 2012.Jesus the book isn't even out yet and you guys are trashing it already. Seriously, wait at least until it comes out, read it and THEN give your opinion. Right now it's just useless and pissing all of us fans off. She's not milking this. If she really just wanted more money, she wouldn't work so hard on all of this beautiful material she's creating for US. FOR US. She doesn't have to do this, she could be working as a doctor or a lawyer and making money. And if you think those two jobs are harder and that writing is easier, you're 100% wrong. It's not easy, it's hard as hell but she does it. AND SHE DOES IT BEAUTIFULLY. It's even harder to get published and get enough books sold. Do your research before you go around calling people cash cows. We've all got to make a living. Some people do it by working at jobs that they absolutely hate and some, like Ms. Clare, do it by sticking with what they're passionate about. So what if she makes money? Her books are amazing and if you don't like them, that's fine. But it's rude to trash talk a series that isn't even written yet. In fact, it's rude to trash talk anything but the least you could do is hold off until you have something TO trash talk.----OH MY GOD. I knew this book would be amazing and it WAS. SO. FREAKING. AMAZING.Cassandra Clare, you have done it yet again. You've managed to make me care so much about characters I just met and made me feel their happiness, pain, sadness as if it were my own. I was so sad when I saw the last page. And then The Last Conversation... really? REALLY?! Gah!I really hope that the people who were trash talking have read it and been stunned. She created yet another beautiful masterpiece and I was more than happy to spend money on it.
