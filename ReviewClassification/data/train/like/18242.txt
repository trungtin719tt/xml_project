4.5 stars!JUST WOW! What on earth did I just read!?This was a crazy fun wild ride from beginning to end! I wish I had known about these books growing up, and will now definitely hand them off to my younger siblings.I'm rather sick of the trite, cliche, dumbed-down, and weak junior fiction novels that line the shelves these days. I have very few favorites in that genre because there is just so little good in it. But this is one that I've added to my list of favorites! Unique, deep, fascinating, and "brainy", this breaks all the molds of J-fic!The characters were all so fantastic, and I quickly became attached to all of them and their journeys. Each of them were distinctive and one-of-a-kind.The ending was beyond fabulous.(view spoiler)[They all got their family!!!! &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3(hide spoiler)]It made me cry. And if a J-fic novel can make me cry . . . well, then it's pretty good!I did dock a half star off my rating because it was SUPER long, and I found myself losing interest in some places. Also, it's pretty . . . outlandish, I guess? Speculative isn't really my thing, so there was some aspects I didn't love. But overall, still 4.5 stars!Highly recommended!
