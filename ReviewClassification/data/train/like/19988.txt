I think this book can be best summarized by quickly scanning the list of reviews; people love it or they loathe it.Me? I loved it.I'll admit that I might be biased in favor of this book simply because I have a fairly unusual set of opposable digits myself. You see, first and foremost, this is a story about thumbs. Well, its is a story about thumbs, cowgirls, body odor, literary theory, feminism, epiphanies, dirty old men, the end of time, sex, psychoanalysis and liberation. But it's mostly about thumbs.Tom Robbins is a damn good writer, and he knows it. At times, he seems to forget that he's telling a story at all, and instead delves into some other topic that has momentarily caught his interest. In a way, it's almost infuriating the way he can write about whatever he pleases without the slightest worry that you'll put the book down. Then again, you *won't* put the book down. If you have an open mind and are patient with his beautiful but sometimes nonsensical ramblings, there's a good chance you'll love this book as much as I do.
