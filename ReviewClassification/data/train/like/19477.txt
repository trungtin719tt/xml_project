Probably the only book I've read in this genre which goes beige and blue instead of all pretentious purple. A penis is a penis and not 'manhood', this sort of writing is a luxury for a book set in WW2 backdrop. I can't think of a single bad thing about City of Thieves. All the literary talks (mostly Russian), cool first-person narration, coming-of-age stuff, Leningrad setting, the characters and everything else makes this a masterpiece; and the fact that David Benioff is the showrunner of Game of Thrones adds to it.
