The style of the wording pleased me very much. So much that it threatened to engulf my perception of the story. I liked the book's plot, but what made me rate the book 5 stars was the presentation of the characters.I thought the Giver would be someone who is the main character...but maybe he still is. Jonas, as a special and precocious boy, is the classic hero in this book.I think many people have read The Giver. If you haven't, then there's no hurry. The story will remain actual at any time of the future. It's a timeless tale, well told. And in the end, we all take something small, and personal, from the book.
