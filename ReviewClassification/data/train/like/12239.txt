I totally enjoyedWatchers. Honestly? it is what it is, and, yes, some of the characterizations and descriptions were a bit, well, heavy handed. But--the dog, Einstein, is completely irresistible. Mostly  is a real page turner. It was my before bed reading, and most nights it gave me nightmares, but I couldn't stop reading. And did I mention the dog?In the first chapter, Travis Cornell is hiking in Santiago Canyon, and he finds (or perhaps is found by?) a stray dog, who seems to be warning him about something lurking in the woods. Initially skeptical, Travis eventually realizes something IS following them, and, taking the dog with him, he heads for home. As Travis soon learns, this is no ordinary dog. I won't say why because how Travis discovers the truth about Einstein makes for fun reading. But as their relationship develops, the dog rescues him in all kinds of ways, most notably by introducing him to the lovely (but terribly introverted) Nora.The bad guys in this book are really, really bad. With one exception--Koontz nicely complicates the evil thing that's pursuing Travis and Einstein. In a Frankenstein's monster kind of way.In his afterward, written considerably afterward, Koontz talks about how readers continue to tell him how much they love this book. (It's because of the dog.)Finally, it's worth thinking about why a dog with human intelligence is so darn appealing. What cultural fantasies about dogs and dogness--and human-ness--are played out here? Nearly every one--the way humans project all kinds of desires and moral behavior onto dogs, the idea that dogs make us human, that their goodness and loyalty bring out the best in us.And, FYI? On the official Dean Koontz website, you can find alist of his other dogs stories. I'm planning to sample a few more.
