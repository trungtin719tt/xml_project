THE GREAT COMPLETIST CHALLENGE: In which I revisit older authors and attempt to read every book they ever wroteCurrently in the challenge: Margaret Atwood | Christopher Buckley | Daphne Du Maurier | Michel Houellebecq | John Irving | Kazuo Ishiguro | Shirley Jackson | Bernard Malamud | VS Naipaul | Tim Powers | Philip Roth | John Updike | Kurt VonnegutTo kick off my career-long look at Postmodernist master John Irving, someone I'm particularly excited to read because of owning first printings of most of his books now (which I buy and sell atmy eBay store), I thought I'd start by ironically re-reading the one and only novel of his I've actually read before, 1978'sThe World According to Garp. Arguably his most famous book (but that can be debated), and certainly the first of his then-four novels to break through to a mainstream commercial hit, it holds a soft spot in my heart because of the 1982 movie version starring Robin Williams, which came out right in the same years that my Midwestern suburb got cable for the first time, which makes it one of the movies on heavy rotation back then that had such a profound impact on me as a pre- and early-teen, back before the proliferation of video rental stores.For those who don't know, it's a famously Postmodernist "metafictional" book, in an age when metafiction was suddenly very hot in the literary world; it's not just a look at a writer's life, and seeing the complex ways that the things that happen to him end up trickling down into his fiction in sometimes sideways fashion (including big chunks of the protagonist's actual fiction embedded within the novel we're reading), but the whole thing is loosely autobiographical to Irving's real life as well (including Irving actually having written various novels and stories before this one that correlate loosely to the novels and stories that Garp writes), making it a story about a writer whose odd real life regularly gets semi-translated into his work, that work being a story about a writer whose odd real life regularly gets semi-translated into his work. And perhaps most cleverly of all, the "world according to Garp" of the book's title refers to Garp's opinion that it's often the most bizarre things that happen in our lives that we take most for granted; and so the novel we're reading about him and his life is actually filled with all these crazy, bizarre moments that never actually make it into Garp's fiction, which makes it both a metafictional statement about literatureanda straightforward zany dramedy about one man's endearingly dysfunctional family and friends.That's a lot to digest, even when I summarize it in a single long paragraph, and the Postmodernist era is littered with artsy-fartsy metafictional projects like this that are an agonizing slog to get through; so that's perhaps the most remarkable thing aboutGarp, and makes it easy to see why it immediately vaulted Irving from an almost unknown academic writer into National Book Award-winning international stardom, because he makes light and deft work out of such a daunting academic exercise, bringing such a beautifully entertaining touch to the proceedings that you don't even realize it's accomplishing so many things until long after you're done and you're thinking back on the experience. It's the rare academic novel that flows with the speed and grace of a throwaway beach read; and it's no surprise, I think, that this is generally the reputation that Irving has continued to maintain in the 40 years and 15 books since, and also no surprise that his three novels pre-Garpremain terminally obscure and hard to track down.At this point I plan on doing a straight chronological run through the rest; so next up will be hisGarpfollow-up, 1981'sThe Hotel New Hampshire, also made into a Hollywood adaptation in its day (starring no less than Jodie Foster and Rob Lowe), but at the time generally considered a let-down that didn't hit nearly the kinds of peaks thatGarpmanaged. It'll be really interesting, I think, to take it on 35 years later, when all the initial hype over expectations is now long-gone.
