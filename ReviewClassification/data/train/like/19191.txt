I'm with the reviewer who said "Loved it" and the one who said "what joy." It isn't funny all the through, and it isn't happy all the way (what is?) but the end result is a treat of a read that beats so much popular stuff all hollow. I guess it just doesn't get those big numbers because Longfellow forgot the vampires and just went with great writing and a thrilling story.
