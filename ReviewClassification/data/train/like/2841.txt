Book Review4+ stars toHow the Grinch Stole Christmas!, a children's picture book, written in 1957 byDr. Seuss. I adored this favorite as a child, and I still watch the cartoon ever year at Christmas. I've also seen the Jim Carrey movie and will watch that one, too. It's such a wonderful take of love and revenge...Most folks who celebrate Christmas must have read or seen some version of this story at some point in their lives. If not, it's basically a grinch that wants to stop Christmas because he has no heart... but when he sees the heartache he causes on all the children who no longer have presents under the tree (because he stole them), his heart grows bigger... and he returns everything ten-fold.It's a feel-good kinda story, when you are down and need something to make you feel better. But it has rhymes and beautiful pictures as well as moral lessons.Every version brings something new to my eyes and mind and ears. I love this story and would watch it All the "who" people and the way the town celebrates Christmas... it's May and all I can think about is watching it right now!About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
