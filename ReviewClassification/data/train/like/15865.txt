This is someone's masterpiece, is what I kept thinking. Someone's lifechanger, someone's book they hug to their chest when they finish and re-read every couple of years for the rest of their life. And I would nominate it for classic canon worthy for that reason, and I should be so lucky to ever get the gift to discuss it with a class.Diaz tells the story of the de Leon family and their trials and tribulations throughout at least three generations under the horrors of the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic and the sorrows of the permanent exile life that followed. It's about the damage, the severe PTSD, the small nervous tics, the unexplained emotional fits and cryptic half-stories told to children with something always left out. However, he makes it powerful through letting all of that play out as apparent background noise to the childhood and young adulthood of the title Oscar, a boy growing up mostly in New Jersey, who is a lover of all things sci-fi and nerddom, bullied because of his weight, desperately in love with girls all around him. It's about him trying to become a person the best he knows how, with all of that working against him, plus everything else his family has already gone through- about being a loner, an outcast not only from your age group, but from your family, your culture, even the supposed expectations of your gender.It's horribly sad on so many levels, and Diaz makes it sting all the harder with his vivid details, crushing turns of phrase and a memorable first person voice that plays with the art of storytelling in a narrative voice that is lucid, full of gallows humor and unsentimental about his deeply flawed, deeply scarred family. Unsentimental, but understanding, and that's the important difference. He never lets you forget why they are the way they are- because people go on allowing the world to be the way it is- because people who try to draw even the tiniest lines of decency in the sand under absolute power absolutely corrupted always end up with a boot in the face. Books like this offer a strong embrace of words for people who have gone through something like this- they say, "I see you. You're not crazy. You really saw that. And it really was as unacceptable and awful as you think. Don't let them gaslight you, because I saw it too. And we're both still here." This is someone reaching out with the gifts they have to connect- this is the best of what writing is for, and I could see it on every page.It isn't *my* masterpiece, though. It's *not for me* and *not about me*- and that's okay. I struggled a little bit with that at first- with the untranslated Spanish, with the cultural references I didn't understand- but lean into that discomfort guys, because then I got it. This struggle? This is what people of other cultures go through every day trying to understand the language, the references, the in-group stuff in America. This is all those 19th century books that assume you know French and what a spinnet is, and you only do if you've been privileged enough to get the keys to that. Otherwise you have to work at it- and honestly, it isn't that hard if you try a little and use your context clues- you'll get a lot of it, and if you don't, you'll get the gist, believe me. Try what it feels like on the other side of the fog for a bit, and make the effort to get past it. Diaz has provided you everything you need, you just need to work at it a bit. If it helps you to make the effort if you think of this as one of the Classic Canon Enshrined Forever That We Must All Read Because They Are Classics, think of it that way. Because I truly believe this is a classic, and if there's any justice, it'll be in that canon before long, if it isn't already. It's gorgeous, it's humane, it's insightful, it offers a tragic tale and a coming-of-age narrative, its got multigenerational drama, its a peek inside a horrible time in history presented with wildly engaging writing. It gets my vote.
