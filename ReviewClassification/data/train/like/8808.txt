On the surface it's a book about two friends, the narrator, Charles Ryder, and his wonderful, but bizarre friend, Lord Sebastian Flyte. Eventually Charles befriends the entire Flyte family and it's this unusual friendship as well as the other relationships -- as they evolve over the course of many years -- which form the basis of the novel.But actually it's a story about the difficulty of being a practicing Roman Catholic aristocrat in England in the 1930s. Charles, an agnostic, doesn't understand when he meets Sebastian and his diverse family why or how anyone's religion could matter so much but as he comes to know the Flytes and sees how each grapples with his/her faith in a hostile environment, he learns. Waugh, a convert himself, was undoubtedly writing from personal experience. It's a brave novel--at first hopeful, seeming to sink into the depths of sin, but then rising again; a story of 'revisiting', forgiveness, homecoming, conversion and ultimately redemption. One of my all-time favorites!This reading date is only one of the many times I've read this.Started: 24 March 1998
