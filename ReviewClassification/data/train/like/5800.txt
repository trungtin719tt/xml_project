My experience in Victorian literature is rather limited, and as the mahogany curtain concealingMiddlemarchopens to a tight-knit British town where men and women, fathers, mothers, sons and daughters receive and perceive each other, I was reminded ofPride and Prejudice, which I enjoyed a few years ago. However, with a comparable event to the denouement of the latter novel occurring after a mere 50 pages in this one, it was clear that the heroes and heroines of this book were going to pass through many heavens and hells.Eliot's writing is of the kind that values depth in the inspection of any element, whether it be an event, person, conversation, action, sentence, glance, or slight tremor of the lip. Her characters are incredibly real, and I could see various parts of myself in so many of the characters that you can only appreciate what a keen observer of homo sapiens she was. At the same time, there is enough humour present that you feel safe that you are not listening to a preacher with a pen, but a relatable voice from a retrograde age, who could conceivably be cheeky enough to conclude a serious story with a common joke.The multi-layered web of human relationships develops, strengthens, lacerates and shines in different gradations of light and shadow with each page and chapter, and towards the end of the reading over three weeks, I was left with a pleasant sense of the book being one of those that highlights and gently prods us to reflect on both our follies; the time we waste, the base thoughts we have, the weaknesses we occasionally run to; as well as the opposite, that of our natural compassion, reticent intelligence and conscious understanding of others' daily toils.In the same vein, the main impression I had from early on in this novel was the great equaliser at work in this universe, that when one meets fortune, you are apt to expect misfortune; and a misfortune only continues until a fortune comes rolling along. To the inhabitants of the town, who could easily be you or me, all of us who are, on average, walking along the path carved at the midline between our most joyous nights and gloomiest days.(view spoiler)[Middlemarch.(hide spoiler)]February 5, 2019
