Ahhh so many feels and angst and agh. I flew through this in a matter of... 24 hours. Literally because of all the back and forth angst. If you know me, I'm here for all the drama and all the feels.I'll probably write a full review later, but a few things did annoy me or that I had some problems with - like whyyyy Anna was SO mean so much of the time. Egh. I loved all the side characters though, and the whole Etienne thing was handled so realistically, though it was totally depressing at times.Overall, it was cute and I totally recommend it if you're looking for a contemporary with loads of frustrating feels. I know, that's a very ironic statement.My Blog~Instagram~Twitter~Etsy
