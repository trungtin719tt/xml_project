UPDATE #2Wow! There has been alot of hate going on for the series/books with all the "hate review" going on and I totally respect all or your opinions since there is something called "freedom of speech" and "voicing your opinion". I totally get that and I don't have anything against you guys but some people are not just voicing there opinions, they're straight out bashing the books and the author. There's also one thing i do not understand, some people claim the books wasted their precious time and believe me time is very precious but yet they continue to waste there precious time to complain about the books, writing a hateful review on it, making a special list such as (random example) "not even if my life was on the line" and come on, like seriously don't waste your time after you claim how precious it is, like seriously just get over it and let it go. :)If I have offended anyone in this I truly did not intend to do that I was just voicing MY own opinion!YES!!! There's a Fourth book can't believe it! I'm so happy that there's a fourth book and sad at the same time. I'm happy because the Hush, Hush, series won't end yet and I'm sad because I have to wait another WHOLE YEAR till the fourth book comes out, but I'm still EXTREMELY HAPPY!!!!!!!!!! =)UPDATEOMG THAT COVER IS GORGEOUS, I CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON IT!!! &lt;3
