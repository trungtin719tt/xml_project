I'm not going out on a limb by saying this is arguably one of the greatest modern plays ever written with the possible exception of Tennessee Williams' other plays. Problem is, I saw the Marlon Brando/Vivien Leigh version (not on stage) and I just couldn't get the cast out of my head when, years later, I actually read it. That's one of the reasons one should always read the book (or play) prior to seeing the movie or play. The impressions your imagination conjures of the characters is more interesting than the ones chosen by the casting director, although in this case you can't do much better than Brando as Stanley, Leigh as Blanche, Karl Malden as Harold (Mitch) and Kim Hunter as Stella.
