Without question one of the finest pieces of literature I've ever read. Incredibly powerful. It is the story of a young prodigy artist who had, in my opinion, the great misfortune to be born into a very ultra orthodox Jewish family (but actually, I feel that way about any religions). He is driven, almost helplessly, to draw and paint against his fathers wishes who considers his efforts to come from the "other side". Definitely one of those books written so well that you hate to see it finally come to an end.
