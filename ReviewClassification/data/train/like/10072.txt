Two people have complained that there are spoilers in this review. Read at your own peril.Hi! I'm Bathsheba Everdene!And I'm Poor Decision-Making Bathsheba Everdene.I sent a random Valentine to a guy on a neighboring farm asking him to marry me, even though I don't even like him! This turned him into an annoying semi-stalker who spent the next several years begging me to marry him for reals!And then, in a further display of my terrible judgment, I married a philandering asshole who only wanted my money and my luminescent beauty! The girl he really loved starved to death with his unwanted child, so he spent a bunch of my money to buy her a really great headstone, and then ran away to join the circus!And then, when he came back from the circus for no reason whatsoever, the semi-stalker shot him. AT CHRISTMAS! In front of the whole county.Don't be like this me!Marry Gabriel Oak on page 25, like you should have, you silly cow.
