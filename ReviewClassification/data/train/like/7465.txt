Houdini Heart is the "Mulholland Drive" of books. Like Lynch's movie, it's this, it's that. It's not this, it's not that. People can discuss it, argue over it, think about it, read it again and again, but camps get created. Some might think it's a dream. Some a descent into madness. Some think she's trapped in a haunted house. Or hotel. Or town. For some, the creative process is set out in this woman's terrible tragic story. Perhaps it's about the destruction of the self to make art. Others have no patience unless they're reading a simple tale told in a straightforward manner. They're uncomfortable not being sure. Others want things spelled out. They don't like being confused. They want a pat and expected ending. They want a book written like their ABCs on lined paper. But some people, like me, love finding themselves in a Chinese Box, patting walls to find doors, opening doors to find walls behind them, climbing stairs that are never the same from one moment to the next. Like Mulholland Drive, our anti-heroine is asleep. Does she really wake up when she says she does? Or does the dream go on and on? Did she do what she says she did? Did she die doing it? Does she live forever by leaving the reality we believe in to enter one she believes in? Her own work?But if you really pay attention, there's an inexorable logic to all of it. There are no loose ends. This is one well knitted book.There's so much to say about this book. So many ideas that crawl under the skin like ants.I am in love with this book. What a movie it would make. If I were an actress, I'd kill for the role. (Another idea: did she kill for her role?)
