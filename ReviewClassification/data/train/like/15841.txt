Do we need another book about Renton, Sick Boy, Spud, and Begbie? Maybe not. Did Welsh break into any new territory? No. I guess it's just the same old sex and drugs and sex and drugs and violence and drugs but I have to admit I loved it. It it Trainspotting good? No, but Trainspotting was an original and we'll never have the same rush again as that first hit of Welsh. I found this prequel much more engaging than Porno, the sequel to Trainspotting. After reading all three books I can only wonder what the boys and girls might be up to now that they are in their 40's. It would be interesting to see if Welsh has the range to take the saga all the way.Update 2019: Welsh most certainly did take it all the way, perhaps ending the saga with "Dead Men's Trousers." Or maybe not. Only time will tell.
