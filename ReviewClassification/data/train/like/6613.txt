Here's the last sentences from the epilogue that really made a deep tug at my heartstrings."She pauses then and crosses her arms, glancing over her shoulder to make sure no one has followed her. Finally, she seems to relax. And then I feel as if I'm witnessing a miracle, as ever so slowly she raises her face toward the moon. I watch her drink in the sight, sensing the flood of memories she's unleashed and wanting nothing more than to let her know I'm here. But instead I stay where I am and stare up at the moon as well. And for the briefest instant, it almost feels like we're together again."Before coming up with those wonderful words, I would have rated it 3.5 or 4. I am not expecting this to be that good because of the movie that I used to watch first. I really can't help but think of Savannah Lynn Curtis and John Tyree whenever I'm staring at the full moon.
