I haven't read this book in over 40 years, however, it's storyline and characters are so imprinted on my memory that even today, I vividly remember the emotions it evoked many days past; it is as if I read it last week.If you missed it as a child, it isn't too late to read this classic award winning book.12/23/18I just completed my second time with this terrific story. Now approaching the end of middle age (yikes, when is that exactly?), I appreciate the fictionalized account of true story. The narration of this book was pleasing and sounded authentic.A young woman sees all of her community murdered by Aleutian hunters when they came into their waters for otters. She is on the opposite side of her island home and hides when she sees the battle. Her brother manages to escape as well but soon dies when attacked by the wild dogs, who occupy the island.Left alone, she manages to survive doing tasks never allowed her from hunting to spear making. Making a new home/shelter to protect her from the elements. She endures an earthquake and the tremendous waves that ravage the island thereafter. She even repairs a canoe. Her ingenuity is very appealing.She enjoys the beauty around her despite her loneliness. She manages to take away a puppy and raises him as a pet (previously forbidden). She domesticates Cormorant birds and an otter too. Her heart is kind and unblemished by the horror, she witnessed but her fear that the Aleuts will return and kill her overshadows all aspects of her life.This tale of survival calls the reader to remember that modern technology is very recent. It's impact has made help so easily accessible, yet this woman had to use what primitive skills she had to survive. I am glad I returned to the Island of the Blue Dolphins.
