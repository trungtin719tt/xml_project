The most impressive of its assets is shared by many other historical fictions. Its retention of the super sad events at times, solely to divert attention from such baffling horror. This, for a young adult novel, hits many nails right on the head. Its inventive narration and its somewhat flash fiction demeanor make it altogether lovable. Endearing. Really, a must. A novel I'd want my own kid to read!
