Jane Austin is one of my all time favorite authors. I have adored every single novel of hers!! Even though she is a classical author, her books are in no way stuffy or hard reads. She questions such topical themes as her titles suggest "pride and prejudice" and "sense and sensibility" with such wonderful humor and such passionate and extravagant characters. Her novels are always fun to read, hard to put down, and leave you wanting more. I'd recommend ANY Jane Austin book (though they are undoubtedly romantic and girly so perhaps not a favorite for guys.)
