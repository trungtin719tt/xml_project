This was the book that spawned adult reading for me. My mom read it aloud on a car trip to the Smokey Mountains. The characters are engaging and could walk off the page. Truly the first experience I had with characters that i would recognize if they walked into the room.Fifteen years later, this book remains the only book I've ever read that still holds all it's charm and wonder with each reread. I make a piont to reread it at least every two years.Cutter Gap and it's people are very much alive in Catherine Marshall's writing. A beautiful story of romance, adventure, and coming of age in a time when being true to yourself was the least of your worries.
