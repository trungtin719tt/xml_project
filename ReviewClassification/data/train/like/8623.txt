The Outlander series is definitely one of my most recommencded series of books. I might even love these books more than Harry Potter - and that's saying something.The Outlander books are set in the 1700s. They start off in Scotland, but later travel to Paris, Jamaica and the American Colonies.Claire and Jamie, the book's two main characters are fantastic. They're deep, smart and action-oriented, yet very real. As their relationship evolves over the series of books, it evolves realistically. They grow together.The historical aspects of the novels are great as well. Gabaldon really does her research, and it's really fun to see how she weaves real historical people and events into the story lines. If you love history, you'll love these novels.And yes - there's romance, too. But these novels are NOT the historical romances usually referred to as "bodice rippers." Much more intellectual than that. Sure, there are some steamy parts...but they're interwoven in a way that makes sense to the story, not the central part of the story.Definitely on the list of my favorite books of all time. They take some effort at between 700-1000 pages each. But so worth it.
