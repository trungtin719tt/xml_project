I heard about the movie before I read the book, so I knew that the premise was a combination of Lord of the Flies and automatic weapons. I just didn't expect the violence to affect me so deeply. I guess I've never been exposed to extreme violence in books where my imagination comes up with images. I definitely discovered a new closet of images with this book.I started this book on a long subway ride home. I was so engrossed by the book I missed my stop by five stations. I will admit there was a woman with attractive legs sitting next to me so as I was reading the right hand side of the book part of my attention was slightly diverted. But I swear that I was more focused on the gory action in the book.When I came to surface on that humid night, my skin had goosebumps from the graphic descriptions in the book. I felt as if my brain was surrounded by a pool of blood. Thoughts raced in my mind about people on the street like "What if I had to kill these people?" or " What if they had to kill me?"Of course I had to calm down a bit before starting again.
