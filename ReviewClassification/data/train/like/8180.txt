Oh I loved this book! I had a very complicated relationship with my mother and though a cliche, I could well relate to that aspect of the book! I also love the movie, but I love the book more! (I read it just before the movie came out). I've also battled severe depression and this book (and movie) is near to my heart. Overall, the details, descriptions &amp; relationships are just amazing! Ms. Wells has Lyme disease and has had a horrible past few years, and when I joined the message boards on her website, I mentioned that I had Lyme disease and as a result have been battling many health problems myself over the years. I was asked by the moderator if I would write about what I've gone through so that fans could better understand her struggles ~ I was so honored and touched!**Update 5/21/2014: Unfortunately, as it turns out, I did not have Lyme disease, although I do have different debilitating auto-immune disease. I have Rheumatoid Disease (aka Rheumatoid Arthritis) and have likely had it since I was fairly young (aka Juvenile RA). Since beginning IV med treatments, I have had an improved quality of life (whereas prior I had no quality of life), but it was too far along to be 'cured' (there is hope to be 'cured' or put into remission within the first two years of the disease's appearance). I've been at and will continue to be at the disease/symptom management stage. It's incurable, chronic and progressive. It's WAY more than just arthritis - it affects my nerves, kidneys (5 surgeries to date in less than 10 years), my heart (which has damage due to an infection that caused a high fever which caused an alarming spike in my heart rate 4 years ago), my eye sight, my motor skills, leaves me at higher risk for heart attack, stroke and cancers vs healthy folks and leaves me open to picking up bacterial and viral infections at the drop of a dime - all in addition to/on top of chronic pain, swelling and fatigue.
