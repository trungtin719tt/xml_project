We knew a kid like Hunter Thompson. You know. He wasn't that cool, and he tried to compensate by being especially crazy. That was the kid who did like twice as many drugs as any of the rest of us, and it was annoying because inevitably we'd have to bail his ass out at some point - like, we'd be happily buzzing along, and then it'd be "Well, someone's gonna have to go dig Rick out from under the bed," or he's pissed his pants, or whatever.Rick was a poser. I got that feeling even more from Thompson'sHell's Angels- it's not just about the drugs, it's also a kind of high-testosterone, gun-toting, motorcycle-riding aesthetic that he seems desperately to want to fit into, and he just doesn't. He's tolerated at best; and, memorably near the end ofHell's Angels,folks do seem to get sick of him after a while.I've heardFear &amp; Loathingdescribed as Thompson's elegy for the 60s, and I don't know what the fuck they're talking about, this doesn't seem anywhere near that well thought out. It seems to me like a braggy, over-the-top stream-of-consciousness diary. It is way better thanHell's Angels,though. It's actually really fun to read.And, yeah, I guess as far as literary drug freakouts go, this is the apogee. I mean, it'sreallya drug freakout. Moment to moment, from exhilaration to paranoia to exhaustion and, incredibly, back around again like six times, it's one of the great literary binges of all time.Top Five Literary BingesMoney,Martin AmisOn the Road,Jack KerouacKubla Khan, ColeridgeThe Bacchae,EuripidesFear &amp; Loathing in Las Vegas(No, you know what, I'm not going to putAlice in Wonderlandon that list. I don't feel like it.)So, look, yeah, it's good. It's "gonzo," which is a word that doesn't mean anything other than this book.* I liked reading it more than I liked digging Rick out from under the bed.* and some gross porn. And the dude from the Muppets.
