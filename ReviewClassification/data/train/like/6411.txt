Maybe I'm bias, but a little bit of bromance could've gone a long way here. A Separate Peace is essentially a story of the relationship between two boys, and if it went a little farther, I think the points it made would've driven much deeper.The plot mostly revolves around a single character, Finny, and although he's lively and exciting, this story is far from. And as such, I can't imagine it being too enjoyable to the middle schoolers and freshmen it is regularly assigned to. But for older more-patient readers, there's plenty to enjoy. What it lacks in excitement, it makes up in every other way.The prose, while pretty plain, is beautiful and flows so well it's easy to burn through this book in no time. The plot, while simple, has a few shockers--and with the story being so short--it almost comes off as a page-turner. Finny is simply one of the funnest, most interesting characters I've come across. And the way John Knowles relates the war to school, and the way the incidents in the story affect Finny's relation to the war and his best friend... It's just brilliant.
