"Human beans is thinking they is very clever, but they is not. They is nearly all of them notmuchers and squeakpips," says the BFG in Roald Dahl's most philosophical work, and, well, that's about accurate I guess, and I'm not sure how I feel about exposing an eight-year-old to this kind of truth. Fine? Might as well start 'em sometime? "Human beans is the only animals that is killing their own kind," he also says, which is not actually true but the point is more or less valid. And "Just because we happen not to have actually seen something with our own two little winkles, we think it is not existing," which sounds like God stuff but I don't think it necessarily is; it's more about imagination than specific theology.This is a heavy book, is my point. There's a lot packed in here. But "Meanings is not important" anyway, says the Giant. "I cannot be right all the time."
