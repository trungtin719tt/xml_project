Book ReviewFor as long as I can remember, I have loved serial fiction and saga stories. The Lord of the Rings trilogy and associated books byJ.R.R. Tolkienare a treasure. I first found the books when I was 14 and had to re-read again when the movies came out in the last decade or so. The second book,The Two Towers, was a worth follow-up, enhancing every original love I had with the story. I'm generally not a fan of the fantasy genre, and have only read perhaps 20 books in total, less than 3% of my entire reading history. But something about these books absolutely stands out among to me as a truly amazing series. I liken it to Star Wars as a movie and film phenomena, when it comes to the saga story. But this one started out as a set of books, which makes it even more fantastic...For me, although I loved all three in the series, the middle one was the least favorite, but they were all still 4+. The first one introduces everything and sets the stage. The last one is the epic battle. The middle one... pure awesome storytelling... but it's the middle. Full of history, secrets, revelations, explanations... you learn the most here. But you also get a little overwhelmed with the sheet amount to remember. But I like that about it too. And to tell the story of dark versus light. To see people you love fall to their death. To think so much will change for the worse. It's a challenge to decide which part of the story to love most.If you've not read the series, it's probably 2000 pages in its entirety. I still think you should read it... but start with book 1 of course. You can't read out of order. Then let's chat again! :)About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
