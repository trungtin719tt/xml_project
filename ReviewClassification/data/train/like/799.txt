A book I'd read an awfully long time ago, when pocket calculators were still the latest thing.Such an iconic staple of American literature, wherein George and Lennie, migrant labourers in the Cali dustbowl, form an unlikely bond in a tale of brutality and tenderness.Typical of Steinbeck, his 'no-fucking-about' narrative fast-tracks his examination of human morality, culminating in a story that has since been immortalised on film and stage.Steinbeck strived for gritty realism and wrote about a time and a place, with all of its triumphs and evils. The overall message is one of morality; he depicted an America that existed, not the one that he would have liked.
