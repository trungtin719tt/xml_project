This book is 1000% my aesthetic, and I love it to the moon and back.I can't believe it's been fifteen years since I last read it. FIFTEEN YEARS, PEOPLE. That's a heck of a long time--but as soon as I started reading, I rememberedeverything. All the sights and sounds and colors, and even specific words and phrases on specific pages; it all came rushing back.Raspberry jam cakes and gilt gingerbread and strawberry ice and smooth green lawns; peeling paint and golden snakeskin and soft yellow dandelions and furry winter gloves. Carpet bags and flannel nightgowns and starchy aprons smelling of buttered toast.Andto top it all off, a little girl who wears a piece of blue sky for a dress (I LOVE HER OKAY). Mary Poppins is my happy place, and I wouldn't mind having her for my nanny--no, I wouldn't mind at all."Don't you know," she said pityingly, "that everybody's got a Fairyland of their own?"Why, yes, Mary, I did know . . . because you weremyFairyland. And for that, I thank you.
