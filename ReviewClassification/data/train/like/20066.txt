This was a really good epic fantasy without all that dense worldbuilding. Or it didn't read like it had a ton of worldbuilding and the focus was on the characters, which is the right way to do it - IMO :)There are three main characters in this story and it does take a little bit to get into it as the POV shifts from one to the other - so just as you're really getting into Arlen's story, it switches to Leesha. But once you get to know all three, then the story just flies along at a nice pace.This world is beset by demons that rise up from the ground each night - they're called "corelings" because they come up from the world's core. I liked this unique twist on things and the people in the story have to ward their houses to keep the corelings out - or use portable ward circles. But wards fade or wash away, and many people die. Everyone is terrified to leave safety once the sun sets.I liked all three characters and was engaged in their stories as they each find their way in this world. I had one problem with the book, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars.(view spoiler)[Leesha is waiting for the right man to give her "flower" to (i.e. her virginity) but when she's traveling back to her home town, she and her companion, Rojer are attacked by thugs and she's ganged raped - this scene doesn't happen on the page - thank goodness - but the story picks up after this happens. I felt this was totally unnecessary. Then right after the attack, she meets up with the Warded Man and a few days later she wants to have sex with him?? She's not even healed from her attack at that point and for her to be ready to sleep with another man...I'm not buying it. This is when I think, "this scene was obviously written by a man." I know there are plenty of strong women who survive and recover from rape, but I'm willing to bet not that fast.(hide spoiler)]I'm planning to continue with the series as I'm curious how things work out with these three.
