I have always had an interest in Charles Manson and, more specifically, the infamous Tate-LaBianca murders. Although that might seem odd and possibly a bit unsavoury, I believe my morbid interest in serial killers and things of that ilk are a result of my complete and utter amazement and horror that people could commit such acts. I want to know more about them, try to understand what goes through their minds and their motives. The Manson trial in particular was one of the strangest, and most high-profile criminal cases in American history, but I had never known much about it other than the crimes themselves.I think with audiobooks I get on better with non-fiction, so this was the perfect book to listen to in this format. Although it took a little while for me to get into it, I soon became engrossed in the entire story, from the desperate attempts of the police to identify the killers, to the court proceedings themselves. What really struck me while listening toHelter Skelterwas how completely inept the LAPD were at various points throughout the investigation - what seemed to be very unusual coincidences that would definitely warrant checking out were often ignored completely by the police on the case, which stressed me out to no end.I really enjoyed Scott Brick's narration - although it was a little 'clinical' sounding at times, I felt that once I got into the meat of the storyline his voice was perfect: a little haunting, sometimes matter-of-fact, and at times I had to try and remember that it wasn't Vincent Bugliosi that I was listening to. I also loved the fact that this was written by Bugliosi, the chief prosecutor for the Manson trial, as I felt I was privy to a lot of very important information and details that I would have otherwise known nothing about.If you like true crime books, and/or have any interest whatsoever in Charles Manson or the infamous Manson murders, I would highly recommend this audiobook. Although it is quite a long one (over 26 hours I believe), you always have the option to speed up the audio (;D), and either way you will soon become immersed in this despicable tale.
