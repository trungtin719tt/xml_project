This is an excellent novel with a powerful message about acceptance. Melody, the main character, has cerebral palsy and can hardly move and can't speak, but she has a lot to say, not to mention a photographic memory. When she receives a computer that can be used as a communication tool, her classmates have mixed reactions to her newly heard voice and she proves her intelligence as time goes on.Melody is a strong character that anyone who has ever felt different or limited in some way can relate to. I don't know a lot about cerebral palsy but from what I understand, there are different variations of it and I think that Draper was very accurate in her writing. This book is emotional, dramatic and intriguing, well-written and definitely an important book for kids to read. My only complaint was the ending, it was slightly off-putting.
