This book could have been tighter towards the end; it gets a little bit predictable, and meanders to a close rather than ends. That aside, this is still an incredibly powerful piece of work. It's not a light book to get through; there are no heroes and there are very few innocents. Behrani, Kathy and Lester, three of the main characters of the novel, are all some of the most finely carved characters I've read in a long time. None of them are perfect; they are all fallible, none of them are even particularly likeable, to my mind. They are all however incredibly human, with a depth and complexity to their actions and reactions that feel utterly real.The most important character of all isn't human at all, though. It's the eponymous house that Kathy loses and Behrani pins all his hopes on. It really is exactly like the title says, a house composed of ephemeral, shifting things, the things Kathy wants to hold on to and the things Behrani wants to achieve. There's a real sense of the house shifting what it is, of being all things and all times to all people, as the book progresses.The prose is beautifully clear; not especially lyrical, but nicely fluid. Dubus also gets my approval for writing English from Behrani's perspective convincingly as the voice of someone who speaks English as their second language; he doesn't fall into cliches, but writes L1 interference convincingly, something which is all too rare. I'm definitely going to watch the movie adaptation if I get a chance, because I have the feeling that Jennifer Connolly and Ben Kingsley could make something truly wonderful out of source material as good as this.
