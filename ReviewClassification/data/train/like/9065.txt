Finished reading another amazing classic !Cry, the Beloved Country is the deeply moving story of the Zulu pastor Stephen Kumalo and his son, Absalom, set against the background of a land and a people riven by racial injustice.This was a deeply moving/ eye-opener book that will stay with me for a long time.Paton touches on almost every level of trouble in post-colonial South Africa: racism, classism, elitism, residual imperical feelings, how wealth corrupts natives, arbitrary segregation, the loss of family values , social pride and other serious matters .the book is lyrically written ( If you're a beginner , you won't find it easy to read ) , the characters almost seem realistic and you get all sorts of feelings while reading it !It will forever be stuck in your head even though the story is fairly simply told , the message behind it is much bigger than what you actually get to read . It makes you think outside of thebox , open your eyes on a lot of things .I had to stop reading several times to think , i just sit there , stare to the wall and think , about people , life , god and principles .There is so much here to learn about hope, love ,forgiveness, and perseverance .Loved this book , highly recommend it !
