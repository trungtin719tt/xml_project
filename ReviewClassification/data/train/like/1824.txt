This was just completely delightful. I never read the Winnie the Pooh stories as a child (just the poems), but I remember several of these stories from seeing them interpreted by Disney, and the nostalgia factor was real. There are so many jokes for adults in these books, and they genuinely made me smile and laugh out loud. I kept getting up to read little sections to my husband because I found them so funny. I'm so glad I have this in my collection now.
