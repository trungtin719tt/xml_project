I LOVED this book, and until I read the last paragraph I couldn't figure out WHY! What was so utterly unexpected for me is that the reason I love this book is precisely the exact reason I would have hated just yesterday it seems?!!? If that makes ANY sense. I almost feel like I have a different outlook on life than I did one day ago...much less one year ago...but I didn't realize it until THIS book.This book is an impressive tale with all of life's elements present...in fact, it is a tale ABOUT life, which in turn is a tale about every one of us. It is about men, women, home, travel, love, loss, happiness, sadness, passion, apathy, and everything in between. This is truly the best love story I have ever read, in more ways than one.
