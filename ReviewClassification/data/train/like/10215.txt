I started rereading this series because of John Scieszka's bizarre hatred ofLittle House on the Prairie. In attempting the perfectly noble task of getting young boys to read more, Scieszka has continuously heaped scorn on that book, banishing it to the girl ghetto of the Sweet Valley High and American Girls series. Putting aside the unfair comparison to syndicate titles published for purely commercial reasons, his assesment ofLittle Houseas a book purely for girls is infuriating.For one thing, gender-segregated reading rubs me the wrong way. For another thing, these books contain aspects that any child might enjoy. There's farming, hunting, construction, cooking, locust plagues, wolf packs, riots, blizzards, tragedy, hope, family, hard work, preserverance, horses, dogs, railroads, envy, loss, and triumph. Ignore the sugary-sweet, insipid television series - these books are genuine and engaging.
