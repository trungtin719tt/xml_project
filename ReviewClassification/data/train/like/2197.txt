All I knew about this classic when I went into was that it was about a mouse.Clearly I knew nothing.You're watching Charlie, the main character, go through an experimental procedure that increases his IQ. The whole book, written in diary entries, let us see how it affects his life and how he struggles through it.I rarely cry while reading a book but I couldn't help myself here.It's a classic for a reason. Read it. You won't be able to put it down.
