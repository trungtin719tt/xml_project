This was my very first Dean Koontz book so I wasn't sure what to expect. Plus, this was in the Horror genre, which I don't find myself reading a lot of. So this book was a huge surprise, because I liked this one a lot. It took a little more time than I like to really get into this, but I was definitely in. I think it was because of the characters. They were so well drawn that I found myself really caring about them. The MC was so sweet and endearing. I also liked the dialogue between him and the other characters, especially with Stormy. Those two things alone, can really make a book more than just an enjoyable experience for me.Some of the story elements were pretty far out there as far as concept goes, but the author made things sound perfectly plausible in Odd's world. So I can't wait to read more by this author.
