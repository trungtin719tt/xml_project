This was the best of the 3 books I have read so far. Action packed from the beginning to the end. The pages just seem to fly by. Despite the book being just a hair under 500 pages I kept looking at he page numbers and 10 to 20 pages had gone by at a time.After Clary's display of power the Clave is interested to talk to her, Jace after his experience with the Inquisitor does not trust the Claves motives, and is determined to stop her from visiting the City of Glass. This book Valentine launches the offensive that has been threatened in the last couple of book. All hell litilery breaks loose. This book is full of revelations, returns and deaths. The only problem I had with this book, the big reveal was pretty obvious by about page 200 but she still tried to keep it a mystery.A great book, and a seemingly a definitive ending to the moral instruments, so I am curious as to what the next book will be about. Maybe the start of a second trilogy. However if you read the first two book you must read this one. Everything that was missing from the second book is in this one.
