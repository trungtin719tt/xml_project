The warning is this: If you are going to become parents you must simply forego being bohemian. Otherwise your children might grow up to be super successful &amp; you will end up eating trash off dark alleyways...Peculiar upbringings are what memoirs are made of! We saw this in the Frank McCourt gray &amp; sad "Angela's Ashes" &amp; even more so in any of the Augusten Burroughs books (mainly "Running with Scissors"). When memoirs are like this, invigoratingly Roald Dahlesque in painting pictures of past predicaments... and obviously the survival of the protagonist, the reader reads on. No matter how bad you have it, someone somewhere sometime probably had it worse.The Walls children (3 of the 4, at least) become inspired by their nomadic parents, wanting to be so unlike their progenitors that they actually turn their lives around. Here is testament of someone living way under the poverty level in modern times &amp; getting out alive &amp; a smarter woman for it. That she appreciates it and maintains a smile is the very heart of this non-fic gem.PS--Can't wait to see the movie.(Probably on DVD.)
