Stamp it on my forehead, folks. I'm here, I'm a blubbering fool, get used to it.I didn't have high expectations going into this novel, I'd heard it wasn't as good as 'The Book Thief'(pfft...whole box of kleenix onthatone). But, I finished it in 7 hours and what can I say?Um... I.AM.A.SAPOkay, I can see the flaws, I mean..I'm not astupidsap. I could see the formula... I knew what was coming. But, the writing makes up for it.Plus, a 19-year-old-suffering-from-low-self-esteem-who-has-a-severe-case-of-unrequited-love-that-is-moved-enough-by-circumstances-presented-to-him-that-he-does-whatever-he-can-to-improve-their-situations?? HELLO??? Um...my 19 year old self would have been utterlysmitten. With lines like this:"The yawn of a girl can be so beautiful it makes you cringe".swoon. It didn't change my life---but it gave me a nice reprieve.Okay, my groupie side is showing. Maybe this is a 'chick' book, maybe I've never matured past the age of 15, maybe I'm one of those dreamy doe=eyed girls that you snarky bastards make fun of.I've got a pint of Chunky Monkey,When Harry met Sallycued, and Peter Gabriel's 'Your Eyes' on infinite repeat.Bring it on
