There is alot going on in this book!Jason (Sookie's bother) is experiencing a trying time, Sookie has to help in a missing persons' case with the local police, and, well, lots more...Sookies' cousin Hadley, has passed away and Sookie is named her beneficiary.Sookie is summoned to sort through and collect what she wants of Hadley's personal and financial assets.She goes to New Orleans and meets some very interesting new character's while she's in town to sort through Hadley's things.While Sookie is in New Orleans...many (and I mean many) issue's arise that require her assistance and attention.Sookie makes many discovery's -some that are scary and others that are just heartbreaking- that all seem to intertwine some how.She finds more than tacky clothes in her cousin's house and must deal with a few issue's from her past.Also, she finds out some things in regurad to herself that she didn't even know about!This book was exciting, crafty, sexy, heartbreakingly sad, imaginative, and (I think) there are some of the best fighting scenes in this book that Charliane Harris has ever wrote in the Southern Vampire series!I loved it!...Heads will fly...Bowling for vampires!I think I experienced the most fluctuating rage of emotions while reading this book.while reading there were times when I was laughing my @ss off, and then I was furious.There were alot of tender moments but there were even more upsetting ones.I was happy to see some things end with some kind of resolution but there are other situations where, well, you just don't know what the hell is going to happen next.Like, what's going to happen with her and Quinn, Eric, Bill, and how will the Queen fair after the...party?What will she say to Sam and how will her and her new friend get along?As always, Charlaine leaves you (well at least she does with me) wanting more!There were alot of anserwed questions in this book, but, with that, many more arised in thier stead.I know that I have (probably) said this with every book, BUT, this is the best book yet!Even though I am incredibly angry with some of the character's; I am dying to see them again because I want to know what certain turn of events will bring forth.Plus I want to see more of the other people that I have just fallen in love with.LOVED THIS BOOK!
