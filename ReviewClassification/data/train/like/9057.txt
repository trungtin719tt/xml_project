5 starsThis is a book I read before I started reviewing and blogging, and it's oh so special to me. Cat and Bones are my favorite PNR couple, and when I recently got myself into a horrifyingly bad book slump, I turned to them for help. I've read this book so many times I've lost count, but I always find something new to appreciate I may have never noticed the first time around. I am so very tempted to continue rereading the rest of this series, and switching to PNR books only for a while. They are my first love of the romance genre, maybe I need to go back to my roots.....
