Just finished my second reading ofWar and Peace. Couldn't have loved it better. Maturity and knowledge of the times certainly helped my enjoyment. It didn't feel as long as it actually is. I loved all Tolstoy's meticulously created characters.I hope to write more soon.Not to be missed!_____I readLeo Tolstoy'sWar and Peacea long, long time ago. However, I still remember how I enjoyed this epic, even if I might have been too young and lacked the knowledge about Russian history that would have allowed me to enjoy it even more. Anyway, it inspired me to keep reading, just for that I am grateful for Tolstoy.If I didn't have so many unread masterpieces in my to-read list, I would revisit it. Highly recommended.
