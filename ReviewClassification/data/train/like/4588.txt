I'm a huge fan of Stephen King andThe Green Milehas got to be one of the best novels he has ever written. In fact, it's one of the best novels I have ever read in my entire life and a great piece of literature to boot!The novel is simply amazing. Once I started it, I couldn't put it down! It is very beautifully written and extremely moving at times. The plot is original, gripping and heart-breaking. All the characters had depth, and were vivid, intriguing, and believable. The story is told so well that it was easy to imagine yourself in Cold Mountain Penitentiary in Alabama back in 1932.It takes a terrific writer to evoke feelings of sympathy for murderers, but Stephen King managed this effortlessly. I wished that John Coffey would be set free somehow, but I knew deep down that he would die. I had tears streaming down my face when he was executed. The novel left me thinking about the death penalty and whether it's time it should be abolished worldwide. I've developed quite a convinced moral stance against the death penalty thanks to reading this novel. My country doesn't have the death penalty so I never really thought much about it until I read this book.I'd give this book more than five stars if I could!
