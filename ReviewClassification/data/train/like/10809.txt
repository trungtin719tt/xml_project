I am completely in love with this series. I love the way that Anne Rice weaves a tale, her writing is so hypnotic.This book continues from the events of the Vampire Lestat, which gave an introduction to Akasha, the Queen of the Damned, and her back story in ancient Egypt. This book takes the tale further and explains the supernatural origin of vampires as a species. The book stepped away from Lestat's point of view in the Vampire Lestat, and takes us through the minds of various vampires as they tell the story of Akasha and the mystery of the redheaded twins.What a great story, I can't wait to continue with the rest of the books in this series.
