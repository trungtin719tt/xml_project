(So I never did a review of this and am deciding to add one now.)I'm a Millennial, and like most Millennials, I grew up with Harry Potter. Notjustthe books, but we kinda agedwithhim(or thereabouts). It's a coming of age story for our whole generation, whether or not we received our Hogwarts letters.And wewerethere together. We were atmidnight release partiesand movie theaters, lined up and excited to share in the adventure. I can't think of the number of people who I've bonded with over these stories--people who I wouldn't have thought to have much in common with in the first place. We came from all different backgrounds, much like the 4 houses, and joined in the Battle of Hogwarts.We mourned the deaths of beloved characters.And cheered on the sheer wit and bravery of others.We debated what Harry should have done with the Elder Wand.But we never let go of this world. We continue to relive these memories through fan fiction, arts and crafts, music, food and drink, andtheme parks.Being that it came out nearly a decade ago, I think it holds up pretty well.
