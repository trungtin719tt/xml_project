More assigned reading for my Soviet Russia class. Initially I found it incredibly dry and difficult to get into, but the further it went, the better and much more compelling it became. Solzhenitsyn drags readers right into the struggles and frustrations of its main character, something few writers can do so realistically, and I found that as the book went on, Ivan really began to feel like a real human being, not only a fictional construct.Tackling heavy themes, Solzhenitsyn is able to write about the underlying political climate without getting too politically weighed down in the prose, and he's able to write powerfully about the will of a labour camp inmate and the things that keep him going in such a harsh environment. It's hard in this modern day and age to appreciate fully what such a life would be like on a daily basis, butOne Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovichmakes it possible.While I had some trouble with the beginning of the novel, I really ended up enjoying this story and it's one which I think everybody should read at least once. If you go into it with an open mind, it's definitely worth it in the end.
