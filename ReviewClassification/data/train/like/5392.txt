It's been a long time I've read a book this much fresh and heartwarming.When Heidi was sent away to Frankfurt, away from her Grandfather and Grandmother, away from he dearest animal friends, to live with Clara, in a closed window house, I felt really sorry for her. She was like a wild bird who was being caged and flying became forbidden for her. I literally could feel her pain. Then again, I could feel her joy when she was placed in her Kingdom where she truly belonged! The ending of this story is just aww!I could read this book again and again without boring myself.
