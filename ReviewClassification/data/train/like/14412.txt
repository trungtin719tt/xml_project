A fascinating read! My only regret? That I didn't read it before I visited Rome.... However, it now gives me a reason to revisit Rome, and definitely head to Florence before I forget everything!This book was written in the 1960's, so I have no idea what has taken me so long to read it. It was recently recommended to me by a friend of mine while we were touring a museum. She mentioned it was one of her favorites, so I put it on my "must-read" list.Irving Stone brings the characters and those times to life so vividly that I almost felt like I was there. Thanks to the wonders of the internet (and Wikipedia!!), after each chapter I would look up the photos of each one of Michelangelo's creations to help me picture them, as each one of them is painstakingly described in this novel. It helped me to bring this wonderful novel even more to life.If a plan to visit Italy is in the works (even if it's not...) I highly recommend this biographical novel about a genius that may never be seen again!
