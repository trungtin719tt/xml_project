Catatonic Damnation: Ironic AbnegationBlue stocking New York, the Gilded Age of the 1870s. The aristocratic denizens float through an orbit of intimations, insinuations and niceties in rigid fidelity to the complicated and exacting demands of such elegant Manhattan coteries.This winner of the 1921 Pulitzer for fiction is an acerbic attack, carried out with indirect deftness, on the oppressive social conventions of an exceedingly class-conscious society.The protagonist Newland Archer, who is a young lawyer in an esteemed firm and heir to one of New York's finest families, stands on the brink of announcing his engagement to the pretty and coddled May Welland, when enters Countess Ellen Olenska, May's beautiful and worldly cousin. Ellen has an aura of European sophistication from the time she has spent abroad and is shadowed by scandal, having left her husband, a Polish count, to declare independence from social constraints.Archer is instantly infatuated with Ellen and develops a strong passion for her, which results in an internal struggle between his desire to consummate his love for Ellen and his "societal" obligation to marry May, purely a fruit of the social order.Ellen, on the other hand, with her veil of enigmatic charm, is a character of depth and empathy. She refuses to conform to the code of customary conduct, with the exception of her general sense of loyalty to refrain from lightly considering betrayal of family, even under the weight of unbridled passion.Wharton draws Newland as a man who is a cut above the typical men of the day, in his intelligence, education and emotions. Yet he lacks the drive and intestinal fortitude to set himself free of the bonds of society and the shelter of the known in marrying May. Ultimately, May resorts to a fraudulent manipulation of Newland in an attempt to prevent him from further pursuing Ellen.The greatest tragedy of this novel was that two women loved Newland Archer, yet he was unable to fulfill the needs and desires of either, nor his be fulfilled by them.Wharton ingeniously crafted a social novel in which a deep current of drama surges below the refined, cultured surface she has painted. Under the amber exterior of affluence, one enters a virtual sphere reeking of anguish, abnegation and sad submission to a pre-ordained social order.Carpe Diemby all means, butonly ifthe Clan Deigns it proper.(view spoiler)[Newland's fear of, and failure to breach, Society Rules, leads to possibly one of the most heartrending endings of any novel in my recent memory: his ironic abnegation, sitting on a park bench outside Ellen's flat in Paris, after May's death, having refused an opportunity to meet with her(hide spoiler)][4rby]
