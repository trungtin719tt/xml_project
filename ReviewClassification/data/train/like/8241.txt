T. S. Eliot'sThe Waste Landis a vast tentacular earthly creature. If its head is in Russia, one of its tentacle is in Honolulu while other is in Cambodia. Since this creature is so big, just two legs won't do. And that is not all. I am not sure what zoologists would say, but I am certain that this creature's tentacles are rigged. If you want to climb on it, you can't do so without taking help and mind you, this system of climbing is so faulty that you can't even take help of any random person. Call it the shyness for speaking out, but finding the person is going to be very difficult. It is the modern world you see, we no longer believe in staticity.
