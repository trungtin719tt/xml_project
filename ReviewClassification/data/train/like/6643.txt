I read A child called "It" for my fifth book report. This is a heart wrenching true story about the author of the book when he was a kid. His name is David Pelzer and he is the main character in the book. He gets abused by his mom everyday without a break. She takes her frustrations out on him for no reason. It is one of the saddest books I have ever read. In parts it is so sad you hardly hold back the tears for the pain that this little kid is feeling. It is even more sad because it is real. He has two brothers in the beginning and three in the end. His brothers treat him like a door mat and I dont know how he takes it without doing something. It is a great book none the less no matter how sad it is and I highly recommend it. It has some vile parts in it so if you are going to pick it up be ready. I will probably read this book again in the future over and over again. It is probably my favorite book. In one part David's mom is really nice to him and his brothers and in a few years she is treating his brothers the same but is beating him constantly. In one part she burns him, in another she stabs him, and in another she basically puts him in a gas chamber. She takes a bucket and fills it full of clorox and amonia and it forms this type of gas when mixed. She locks him in the bathroom. The first times she leaves the vent on which he gets to breath some fresh air. The second time she realizes that he is using the rag he is supposed to be cleaning with to cover his mouth and so she puts it in the bucket, she also turns of the vent. Amazingly he survives. If you want to know more than read the book. This a great book I will say again and it is a really quick read if you are looking for one. I read this book in a few hours. Once again I highly recommend this book and its sequel which I have read. It is called "The Lost Boy." It is great too.
