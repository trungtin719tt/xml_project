Slightly disappointed with the next-Gabriel Garcia Marquez, I took on this classic in one sitting.&amp;...J***S!Where has this one been all my life? I adore "Candide" because it is rife with adventure, it is a speedy read, and at the very end you experience a vortex of feelings and NOVEL concepts. It transcends literature itself.Compare this to Dante. To Shakespeare. I could not help but smile at all the awful misadventures of our poor fool. This is made for someone, like me, who thinks "The Alchemist" by Paulo Coelho isn't all that...!I even told G that I was put off by the cover--that is, not until the entire book is ravished &amp; torn apart by the ravenous reader does the simple, almost academic print of a globe in this particular edition of "Candide" make sense.So...voila! Voltaire.Easily EASILY Top Ten.
