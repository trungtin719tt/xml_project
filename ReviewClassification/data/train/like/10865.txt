I'm just going to give a generic opinion of the whole series.We love them.The end.Okay, so maybe I'll tell you that we read them outloud to the kids almost 2 years ago. So they were 5 going on 6 and 2. They all loved them and followed the plot and talked about the characters during their play.We're re-reading them again (now ages 8, 4 and 2) and they're loving them even more than the first time. All I hear, all day long is "For Narnia" and then they rush through the house, swords drawn. They have made Reepicheep figures out of pom-poms. They have conversations with the characters, "So Edmund, what do you think about the squirrel doing such and so?"I think this is a series of books that needs to be read over and over again.
