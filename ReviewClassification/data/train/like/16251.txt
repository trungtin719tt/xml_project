WELL.That, my friends, is how a conclusion should be done!HUZZAH THAT RICK RIORDAN IS SUCH A GENIUS. And also knows how to mix heartache with humour and danger with excitement and dragons with talking tables. I mean, really. This dude. I am in awe. And, so far, I've found this series a bit waffly (and not the foodie kind) and rambly, but for the finale? NOPE. Perfection. Everything was balanced and I found myself just gobbling up pages like a Hades on fire.Of course the characters are 95% of the reason I love this series.They're so DYNAMIC. And funny. And cute. And shippable. And I was so so happy with how it all concluded. A bit o' tragedy, a bit o' sweetness. YES I SHALL GRIN LIKE A RAUCUOS PINEAPPLE.But just quickly, let us peer individually at our favourite fruit salads:+ Percy:I was a bit disappointed that he didn't have any POV chapters. They're always myfavourite. In fact, I think he took really much of a backseat in this book and that's like my only complaint.+ Annabeth:See above. WAH. I mean, I know they had tons of POV time in Mark of Athena, etc, buuuut...I would never say no to more of Annabeth's snark and brains.+ Jason:Okay, I KNOW I said at the beginning he was my least favourite, but omg, he's grown on my like a loyal barnacle. I like Jason now! He's loosened up a little and is more easy-going and I didn't even mind that the finale focused on him a lot.+ Piper:She features a lot in this one too. (It's like a Jason/Piper/Nico feature, tbh.) She has SERIOUSLY CHARMSPEAK SKILLZ. THAT IS ALL.+ Frank:Frank didn't POV either, and I love Frank so this was sad. But he did turn into a bulldog when he got frightened and that was funny.+ Hazel:Seriously I don't even know what Hazel was doing half the time?? Eating waffles? Who could know.+ Leo:OMG LEO MY DARLING BABY AND FAVOURITEST OF ALL THE 7. LET ME JUST HUG YOU AND SAY YOU HAVE FRIENDS. HE isso funnyand has such terrible self-worth and his love for Calypso was endlessly cute. I just love Leo's inventions and spunkiness and the way he can't sit still. ALTHOUGH HE KEEPS SOME TERRIBLE SECRETS IN THIS BOOK AND I MAYBE NEED TO SMACK HIM.(view spoiler)[I knew he wouldn't die either! I kind of though maaaybe...? But then Rick Riordan doesn't seem like the murder-everyone's-favourites kind of guy, so I wasn't surprised that Leo reappeared to sweep Calypso off her feet. Though Leo SUCKS for not telling his friends asap that he was alive.(hide spoiler)]+ Nico:AHHHH NICO!!! OMG. HE IS WONDERFUL. He and Leo are my favourites (but, well, I love Percabeth. Omg, stop making me choose.) But Nico had some serious POV time and a lot of development and it was just adorable to see him grow and get a(view spoiler)[crush on another camper other than Will! BAHHHHHH I DIED LAUGHING WHEN HE CAME OUT TO PERCY AND ANNABETH. Idied, I tell you. I actually hit myself in the face with the book I was laughing so hard.(hide spoiler)]It was glorious.I'm so glad it was funny too! AND EXCITING.I love Percy and Jason's "oh bro" moments. And I liked how they wrapped up loose ends and kept you guessing and dreading. Basically it was glorious and probably my favourite out of the series (although Mark of Athena. C'MON THAT WAS INCREDIBLE). I'm kind of sad it's finished now though...awk. What now? Kane Chronicles? Magnus Chase? READ RICK RIORDAN'S SHOPPING LISTS??? All the possibilities
