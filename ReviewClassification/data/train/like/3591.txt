Yo ho ho and a bottle of rum. Shiver me timbers!This is THE PENULTIMATE pirate adventure, me mateys!Never mind that it's written for a 12-year-old or that practically every aspect of this adventure has percolated through our collective zeitgeist.Here it is! The YA to eat ALL YA. Or the tale to drown your young one in so much rum that he or she expires by the bloody knife he or she didn't see while inebriated or by the blasted drink itself.Pure escapism? No. There's a bit of a heart in here and mercy is not the least of it. But even mercy has a very keen edge.Pirates, mutiny, dastardly villainy, greed, and democratically elected captaincies.Wait... WHAT?*slips quietly out the back door*Where's Sparrow?Even so, this was quite a fun diversion. :)
