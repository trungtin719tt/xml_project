My sentimental favorite of the Anne series. I always thought college was going to be just like that - my best friends, a cute little house in a great neighborhood, and my childhood friend, madly in love with me. Anne is one of my favorite literary heroines, and I liked her transition between girlhood and adulthood. She's grown out of classic Anne of Green Gables, but she's still the same person.I must have read this book 30 times, and it never gets any less fun. It's one of my top 5 comfort books.
