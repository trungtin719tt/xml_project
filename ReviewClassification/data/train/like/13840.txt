Following on from Pyramids, Guards! Guards!, and Witches Abroad, Pratchett continues his study of theology, philosophy and the misuse thereof by mankind, touching on the same ground that his good friend Neil Gaiman would later dive in to with American Gods - what happens to the god when people stop believing in it?It's funny and sharp with its satire, exactly as you would expect from Pratchett. And in taking months to read it all of my thoughts and theories have dribbled away to be replaced by a lasting impression of impressive storytelling and high entertainment. Still, it could be worse, I could be deeply offended on behalf of religious people everywhere who choose to ignore two simple guiding facts of life:I: This is Not a GameII: Here and Now, You Are Alive.
