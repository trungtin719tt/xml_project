I AM SO EMOTIONAL DON'T TOUCH ME.This story was beautiful and I learned so much from it and man. Just so good.I also read this for #diversathon (even though I'm finishing it about a week later) and I really feel like I learned so much about a culture that I really knew nothing about. It was eye opening and interesting and so educational.The characters were beautifully written and Amir was fantastically developed. Overall the plot was engaging though the pacing lacked at times. The message was beautiful and the ending made me cry.Read this book IT IS GREAT.
