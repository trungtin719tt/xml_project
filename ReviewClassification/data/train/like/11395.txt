Nope, this book isn't one of those annoying zombie dystopian novels despite its title. Actually it's about three men in prison and the way they survive. I found the language too crass and rude sometimes but otherwiseThe Zombie Roomis an excellent novel with themes similar to books and films likeThe Shawshank RedemptionandPrison of Secrets.
