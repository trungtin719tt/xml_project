Books have to be heavy because the whole world's inside them.Magic,this book is pure unadulteratedmagic.Meggie and Mo (her father) are a pair.They're two peas in a pod,they're a peanut butter and jelly sandwich, they're ice cream and sprinkles. No matter what - they are together.Mo works as a book binder/restorer andMeggie is a full-time reader- she ready every single moment she's not in school.When amysterious manfrom Mo's past shows up on their doorstep, he packs up all of their things and whisks Maggie away to to her Aunt Elinor's house.And, despite all their efforts,evil is circling ever closerto their little family and Maggie is at a completeloss at what to do.She's read countless stories of heroines ... but to actually become one? That will take pure bravery and nerves of steel...There is something inexplicable about thewayFunke weaves magic into her novel. Even after all these years, as soon as I read this book, I check the garden for fairies and glassmen.There's something soheartwarming and trueregarding the dynamic between Maggie and her father, Mo.Even thecrankinessof Eleanor as she begrudgingly takes in Maggie is enough to set my eyes alight as I read, and reread this book.Perhaps, it is because (for the first time) characters in a book loved reading as much as I doWhen you open a book it's like going to the theater first you see the curtain then it is pulled aside and the show begins.Honestly, every quote in this book justspeaksto me:Is there anything in the world better than words on the page?Highly, highly recommended for kids (and adults) of all ages!Audiobook CommentsRead by Lynn Redgrave - and she did a rather good job.
