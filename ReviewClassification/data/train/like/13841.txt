"You can die for your country or your people or your family, but for a god you should live fully and busily, every day of a long life."And with that, I no longer have an excuse not to hunt down every Terry Pratchett book to enjoy and, probably, treasure. I've loved every book of his I've read to date, but that one line, so self-evident and borderline blasphemous to ANY religion, cements my belief that Mr Pratchett is one of the greatest thinkers and writers of our time. Perhaps delving into the rest of his bibliography will disabuse me of the notion, but there's only one way to find out, isn't there?One thing I really enjoyed about this edition of the book (and part of the reason that I now know I need to read all his other works) is the bonus guide to Discworld at the end. It is fun and informative and a great way to seduce the as-yet-uncommitted reader.
