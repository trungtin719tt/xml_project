It wasBUTTERFLYINGfantastic! I loved the new poetry slams in this book. I loved Will's swoon worthy slam to Lake called Because of You. I loved Kiersten's powerful slam that helps her to stand up to school bullies. I loved Caulder's heart warming slam to his brother Will. I love how Lake, Will, Kel and Caulder make a family unit and how they adopt in Gavin, Eddie, Sherry and Kiersten, proof that blood doesn't always make up family. And what a beautiful family they all make up together. ILOVEDthat this book made me laugh, made me sad, made me cry and then made me happy all over again. ILOVEthat this book makes me want to start Will and Lake's story all over again from book one. ILOVEDwhen they ended their nights together at the dinner table that they ended it with SUCK and SWEET.(READ the book to find out what this means.)Lastly, ILOVEhow I will never look at the word butterfly the same way again and I know that when the next time I see that word that I'm positive it will make me giggle.Well heck, I forgot to add that I really loved the creativeness of having the mother leave behind quotes for Lake and Will in the shapes of stars when they needed her advice. It makes me want to do something like that for my own daughters when they grow up and leave the nest.One last final note: I hope that some lucky woman out there finds herself a true life WILL.When I picture Will this is who I picture.my link text
