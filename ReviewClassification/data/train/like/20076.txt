*4.5/5*WeeEooOOW. THIS WAS GREAT.You guys know I typically despise romance in YA novels, but the relationship and the characters in this book were SO CUTE and so well done that I couldn't do anything but love them.Really unique main character, and the ending was sort of open which I felt worked really well with how the story went.
