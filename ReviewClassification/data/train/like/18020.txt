Terrific book, truly creepy. A page turner about a journalist going back to her tiny Missouri home town to cover the recent murders of two little girls. Gillian Flynn's writing in Entertainment Weekly has always been a notch above, and her first novel is no disappointment.What's remarkable about this book is that it focuses on some of the most damaged and interesting women I've ever seen in fiction. Strong women in fiction usually means one of three things:1) Ass-kickers in fantastic outfits that talk, think and fight like men (think Tarantino)2) Delicate little homebodies with surprising reserves of strength when needed (think Jane Austen)3) Raging bitches (think Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada)What's great about the women here is that they don't really fit into any of the above categories. They're conniving, manipulative, sweet, deeply insecure, fierce and hopelessly crippled people whose flailing at one another feels very real and very scary. Great book.
