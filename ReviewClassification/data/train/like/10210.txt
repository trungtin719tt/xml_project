oh! heartwrenchingly wonderful! to love someone from afar and to return to them when you're dying to confess of your love! those final scences are matchless!--where roxanne is sewing away in her convent and cyrano comes, fighting death to reveal that "how many things have died and are now newborn? why were you silent for so many years? all the while those letters, every night on my breast, YOUR TEARS! you knew they were your tears!" oh man oh man. *sigh*
