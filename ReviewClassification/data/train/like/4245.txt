Here's how this book should be marketed: Dystopian world meets 'The Bachelor'.....sort of.NOT THE HUNGER GAMES. There's no fight to the death here.. just a bunch of young women vying for the heart of one very handsome prince.Personally, I've been excited to read this book from day one of it's announcement. Say what you will about the cover, but holy heck is it gorgeous. If I wasn't so damn short, I'd totally rock that dress. The chance to become a princess? BESTILL MY 5 YEAR OLD HEART!I loved the whole premise of the book. It was simple, clean and just an over all great book. America, the female lead, is strong but has her faults, as she tends to be a bit whiny. No character is ever perfect, which I am sure we will see further development of all 'The Selection' characters as the series progresses.The CW has put together a pilot for 'The Selection' and I can't wait to see how they will translate this from book onto our TV screens. Ethan Peck as Prince Maxon... OH YES.
