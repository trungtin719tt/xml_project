Oh, Tom Robbins. Tom Robbins, I would like to apologize to you. When I wrote that review ofStill Life With Woodpecker, I was a little angry at you, but for reasons beyond your control.I do still kind of take issue with Tom Robbins for all of the things I mentionedin that review- namely, he could use a good editor. But my editor leanings can stop being so stuffy and be pushed aside.Even Cowgirls Get The Bluesfollows one miss Sissy Hankshaw, a woman with extraordinarily large thumbs and a passion for hitchhiking. She loves her Native American blood but also loves a band of Cowgirls who become her cohorts. The plot order is not so chronological, but one of the book's themes takes issue with the concept of time, so it makes sense for time to not quite fit in there. Other themes are pretty much the kind of thing I eat up - relationships, strong women, travel, identity ("normal" and "strange").In comparison toStill Life With Woodpecker,Cowgirlsdoes feel more thought-out, less random, overall more cohesive, though, in retrospect, I likeWoodpeckermore than I did at the time. Sometimes a writer takes something that is so important to you (in this case, good editing), and gives it the middle finger, so the knee-jerk response is something of a "fuck you." Truth is, I don't think Robbins could be edited well, so he may as well not be edited at all. The best thing about Robbins is his voice, and any person mucking around with it is just going to make it weaker.He's also better at simile &amp; metaphor than any other author I can name, so if you ever want to learn how to do those things well, with panache, with flair, with personality, pick up something by Robbins.
