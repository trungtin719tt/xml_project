I kept fluctuating between 3 and four stars. Ultimately I'd probably opt for 3 and 1/2, but since that's not an option, I'll go with four because I think it's more of a personal taste thing over the quality of the book.I'm a huge fan of "Inkheart" so had high hopes for this novel. I quickly realized the two have very different styles, and rightfully so, as this book is (at least I assume) geared for a younger audience.The cast of characters is delightful, each with their own stories and personalities, and you can't help but hoping the "good guys" win. The plot was interesting, but I did feel that there were two stories/plots going on, and that the first half of the book wasn't quite the same as the second half.Also, I'm not entirely sure what I think of the ending, the "messages" etc. Nothing bad, just I'm not sure what I think of it. I finished the book and still had questions as to the why, and what would happen - but, perhaps that was Funke's intent, that she didn't want everything neatly wrapped up. (again, back to the personal taste thing)I did enjoy the book, and was curious to learn how it would end. It wasn't predictable on certain plots, so kept me guessing.I also enjoyed the style of writing, the settings were vivid and it was fun to read a book set by the canals and winged lions of Venice.***Decided to go ahead and give this a try. So far it's a very different style from Inkheart, but I'm intrigued.:)
