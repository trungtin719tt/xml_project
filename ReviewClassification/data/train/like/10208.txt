This classic was more fun to read than I expected! Yay for more witty repartee, impassioned poetry and action, and tragedy than I remember from the movie. Then again, I can appreciate a lot of it more, especially the poetry and tragedy, now that I am older. And possibly more mature.It's impossible not to see myself in the title character. Maybe I'm his unknown and less talented cousin, with some wit and some skill, yet lacking the nose to receive as much attention and notoriety."Pastry pays for all" became an instant favorite quote. What? Have you never truly appreciated the heights of joy that can be achieved with a fantastic pastry?Another of my favorite quotes was "I am tired of being my own rival", which I enjoyed all the more because Cyrano was not the one saying it :) The section of the play where Christian wrestles with his awareness of the situation adds some serious depth and richness to the play.I wished that Roxane had come to the realization of who wrote her all those love letters much sooner than the very end. There could have been some realization of joy, just in time for the shoe to drop, so to speak.And I never realized how much Cyrano's large nose is a gimmick and not really fundamental to the story. It's hard to imagine the story without it, and yet it's very much not necessary.
