i loved this book. i didn't *expect* to love it, which is why i had put it off for two years after receiving it. i'd read bits and pieces of thompson's work, but never sat down to read one end-to-end. now i know what i've been missing.this book is everything i had hoped On the Road would be. a wild travel adventure with protagonists i would root for. they do disgusting, off the wall, unconscionable things, but they do it with such spirit that you can't help but laugh, over and over again.a good writer makes you love characters you ought to despise. as i was reading this, i understood why the world mourned the loss of thompson and his take on things. planning to read more of his work. a great intro- and most people say it's not his best- so i know i have lots to look forward to.
