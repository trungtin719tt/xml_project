My first Dean Koontz novel and what a surprise it was! I was not expecting to go into this one and come out with a new favourite on my hands! I defy any dog-lover to read this book and not fall in love with Einstein and the whole story.In a way, the plot reminded me of Frankenstein: scientists messing around with genetics, creating things that probably should not be created and then reaping the consequences. Koontz raises a lot of interesting questions and though I don't agree with some of his opinions on religion &amp; politics, he handled them well! But I haven't learned my lesson and I would like my own Einstein, please and thank you.The pacing is fantastic, my edition was 600 pages and I flew through it! There were some truly eerie moments, lots of action, and surprisingly a few tear-jerking moments! Well, maybe not so surprising given that one of the main characters was a dog. Don't play with my heart like that, Koontz. The other two main characters were also interesting and fully fleshed out, and I enjoyed Nora's character arc, from recluse bullied and abused by her aunt, to a confident and brave woman!Combining some of my favourite things (dogs, and plots where secret government agencies do secret things and then the secret things turn around and bite them on the ass) with great characters and plotting, I was truly surprised by Koontz!
