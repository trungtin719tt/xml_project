I think this has to be the best book I have ever read. I keep recommending it to everyone so much so a friend of mine believes I have shares in the publishing world! I was completely surprised when I read this book. What I thought it would be like and what was delivered far exceeded my expectations.You end up liking both characters despite them conflicting with each other. The ending is remarkable. It is so engrossing that you can actually imagine and visualise what they experienced both physically and emotionally. A true genius when it comes to story telling anyway that's for sure!
