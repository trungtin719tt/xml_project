It's Tolstoy. What else can be said?A few years later, I've found his epilogue to be more painful and didactic, but the characters to be even stronger. Tolstoy has a gift for little descriptive comments which add so much to his portrayal. I remember the doctor carrying a cigar so it doesn't stain his bloodied fingers, or the German doctor trying to remember all of the gourmet foods he eats. (To say nothing of Pierre!)
