An early classic in the post-nuclear holocaust genre. I have read the book two or three times in the last 50 years.Miller was the prototypical one-hit wonder. Though he did write a lot of SF short stories before he publishedCanticle, he never wrote another novel.But hey, if you only publish one novel, and it's like this one? Not bad at all.I suppose I need to read it again, I can't really remember how it ends. Or maybe it doesn't really end, just fades away? Or returns endlessly.
