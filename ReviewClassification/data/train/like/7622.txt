You know those annoying kids who go to the movies to watch any Harry Potter movie at the earliest hour possible, dressed in hogwarts robes, speaking with a British accent and claiming to be in Gryffindor? Or those kids who immediately jump into a conversation involving Harry Potter and inform everyone of all they know on the topic? Yeah, well. I'm one of them.
