For my money, this ought to be an award-winning book. It ought to chosen by Oprah so all sorts of people who would love it would find it. It's phenomenal. The characters, the philosophy, the theology, the setting, the historical insight, the WRITING! To walk with Jesus and the Magdalene and to feel them for the first time as people struggling with their times and their place in that time, to meet them in all their pain and sorrow and joy...what a trip, man!
