This book was pretty slow getting started, but when it did, it did it with stupendous style. Lisbeth Salander ran the show in this one, which I really loved. I liked Lisbeth in the first book, but in this one, we see more sides to her than ever before. Let me put this plainly, I want to slurp freshly brewed coffee and scoff Billy pan pizza's with this woman, even if she is a cold and calculated pain in the ass at times.What I especially liked about this book, was all the weird twists and turns. When I thought I'd definitely got a theory to what was actually going on, the author threw another major spanner in the works, and I was back to square one. You don't really find peace with the story, until the very end of the book, and at that point, I felt kind of deflated that I'd finished it. At this moment, I need more Lisbeth Salander!
