Okay so I'm four starring this right now but honestly it might be higher. I DON'T KNOW. I FORGET HOW TO LIKE BOOKS.I have a 2.97 average rating, you guys. This isn't something I'm "good at."Anyway here is what I know:- I love Neil Gaiman- like seriously he is consistently just cranking out sh*t I like- okay I mean sure I didn't loveAmerican Godsand I didn't loveFortunately the Milkand I didn't loveThe Sleeper and the Spindlebut do any of them even count??- sure American Gods probably definitely counts, seeing as it's his most popular book and all- but whatever because I didn't even hate any of them!- and considering the fact that I lovedCoralineandThe Graveyard Bookand ESPECIALLYThe Ocean at the End of the Lane, it balances out regardless!- anyway. about this actual, you know, book that I'm allegedly reviewing:- it's very fairytale-y, which I love- very British, which I'm always meh on, but this time in a fairytale way so it's fine- the characters aren't anything to write home about BUT the world is so- also it's just fun!- I don't know what else to tell you. The cover says it's a "fairytale for adults" and a) that's rad as hell and b) that's exactly what it is so. I'm more than contented.Bottom line: I'm going to keep reading Neil Gaiman books and hoping for the best!! That process has worked out for me pretty well thus far.
