This book had me like...Unlike anything I've ever read, but I loved it. Especially the whole last chapter had me laughing morbidly at scenes the author probably did not intend to be satire. The circumstances of Jean-Baptiste's birth and upbringing were also hilariously awful to me.During the rest of the book my general reaction was this:I wasn't sure if I was gonna be sent straight to hell for rooting for the main character so I tried to keep my opinion out of the general reading process. (I say this because Jean-Baptiste murders several innocent people and despises every person he meets in the entire story. Not a role model.)Overall, good book, not for the faint of heart.
