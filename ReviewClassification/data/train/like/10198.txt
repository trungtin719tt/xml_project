I read "Cyrano" in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia, just as things were heating up between the Arabs and the Israelis leading to the 6-Day War. What a pleasure to read the wit and romantic comedy of Rostand during such a stressful crisis. The next time I would like to read it in French, of course with a good French-English dictionary by my side.Great literature, especially comic literature such as that of Voltaire and Shakespeare, or Wilde and Amis, can sustain us through the grimness of life.
