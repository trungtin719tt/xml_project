My dad gave me this book when I was a teenager and it changed my life. It comes off to some people as a book on how to manipulate people, but that is really far from it. In my experience there's really no way to put the practices this book preaches into effect with your life and not become someone who actually treats people better as a result. Funny how treating people better leads to leadership, friends, and influencing them. It's not an accident.I've read the book at least 3 times, with another time soon approaching as it's been awhile. I would recommend it to anyone interested in being more friendly. And in reality, I think pretty much everyone should read it.I didn't give it an "amazing", 5 star rating, due to the fact that it wasn't the type of book that was hard to put down, but that said it's still a great book. Read it. Seriously.
