Loving Jane Austen as I do I was thrilled when my daughter surprised me with a copy of her complete novels. If you enjoy the weight of a book in your hands, and you love Jane Austen, this is the book for you.I must admit that I skipped Sense and Sensibility and Pride and Prejudice because I had only recently re-read them. So I skipped to Mansfield Park, read straight through that, and followed with Emma, Northanger Abbey, Persuasion and Lady Susan. I loved them all, and I believe I have a new favorite JA novel.I was always a fan of Pride and Prejudice, but I believe I like Northanger Abbey best now. As with many Austen stories, misunderstandings and totally unfounded assumptions create tension, and story builds and feeds upon that tension. Jane's descriptive ability is on display in her word picture of Northanger Abbey, when we finally get there. The novel is more than half over before our heroine, Catherine Morland, first sets eyes on the abbey. I could see what Catherine saw, and as she explored the home of the Tilney family, my mind's eye could follow her explorations. This was something I hadn't really noticed in other Austen novels.Re-read an Austen novel! They never get old. I seem to discover something new with each reading.
