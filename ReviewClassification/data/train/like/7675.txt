"When work is a pleasure, life is a joy! When work is a duty, life is slavery."-Maxim Gorky.I bought this novel in tandem withNever Let Me Go, a book that proved to be so tedious I abandoned it, preferring to watch paint dry.Nevertheless, I was prepared to give Ishiguro the benefit of the doubt, wipe the slate clean and start afresh.The story is told from the POV of Mr Stevens, English butler to Mr Farraday, his nouveau riche American master: I invite you to imagine Mr Stevens to be an amalgam of Wodehouse's Jeeves, and Star Trek's Mr Spock.This might just be one of those very rare occasions where seeing the moviefirstactually enhances the reading experience. Having already viewed it on the big screen, I could easily imagine Sir Anthony Hopkins's narration, almost as if this were an audiobook.To his credit, Ishiguro perfectly captures the stiff-upper-lipped dialogue expected of an English country house butler. Here, the author takes Wodehouse's cartoonish idea and gives it a harsh reality check.Stevens' adorned, almost pompous elocution is on point, but I half expected the Anthony Hopkins in my head to begin shouting, "Mr Christian! Damn your hide, sir! I shall eat your liver with some fava beans and a nice Chianti!"Stevens obsequiously knows his place and has such a blinkered sense of duty that the reader is left with an uncontrollable urge to step into the story and shake him about by his stuffy starched collar.For me, the most interesting side to his character is that he doesn't bear any snobbishness towards his 'new money' employer, and treats him just the same as he would a lord or a prince.Amusingly, he is maladaptively unaccustomed to banter or tomfoolery, unlike his jovial boss.However, in this respect he is very much like Sheldon fromThe Big Bang Theoryand so (guilelessly) has a bash at banter, whereupon awkward silences and a scurry of tumbleweed ensues.Stevens is deserving of our pity; love is resolutely not on his radar and a visit by interested housekeeper, Miss Kenton, to his pantry with a vase of cheery flowers, causes his dangly bits to retract into his sexless body.However, dear smutseekers, I later thought I'd spotted a saucy Ishiguro euphemism (and I quote):"Mr Stevens happened to encounter Miss Kenton in the back corridor.""Utter filth!" I cried, and begin to thrash myself with birch twigs, before realising that I'd allowed my imagination to run away with me, yet again *sigh*Unfortunately, Mr Stevens is the architect of his own downfall, his dogmatic restraint inevitably causing him to miss out on life, and love.Although I doubt I shall ever be a true Ishiguro fan, he has redeemed himself with this body of work, and there is a telling poignancy to the reflective ending, which prompted me to bump my score up to a respectful five stars.Here is my butler-esque star ratings guide:*****"I say, sir! Most becoming!"****"Most generous, sir. I shall pass on your kind comments to the staff."***"May I suggest an alternative, sir?"**"Oh dear! Will that be all, sir?"*"I have no doubt that your father will be turning in his grave, sir."
