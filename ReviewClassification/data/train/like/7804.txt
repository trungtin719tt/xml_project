"The Reader" focuses on the generation born after World War II in Germany dealing with their knowledge of the horrors of the Holocaust, and realizing that people of their parents' generation had a role in carrying out the atrocities. They may find that they loved or thought highly of people who were part of the Nazi machine.Michael Berg is the narrator of this fictional memoir which opens when he first meets Hanna Schmitz. Michael is 15 years old, and Hanna is in her 30s when they become involved in an intense, volatile sexual relationship. Hanna also enjoys having Michael read aloud to her. When she leaves town without any warning, Michael blames himself, wondering what he did wrong. He can never form a good relationship in the future because Hanna is always in the back of his mind.Years later, Michael sees Hanna again in troubling circumstances. He sees another side of Hanna--a woman who has been hiding many secrets from her past. After many more years pass, Michael decides to sort things out in his mind and write down his memories. He is part of the after-war generation whose lives have become wrapped up in the previous generation's secrets, guilt, and wish for forgiveness."The Reader" is an excellent short book written in spare language. This is the second time I've read this thought-provoking story, and each reading has left me feeling disturbed and unsettled.
