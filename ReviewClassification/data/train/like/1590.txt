And so it comes to a close, this amazing series, with a battle royal. Which of our most loved and most loathed characters will survive? Which side will prevail? What secrets will be revealed in this final episode? The Harry Potter series is one of the triumphs not only of modern marketing but of contemporary literature. While the danger in any series exists that the joy of newness has rubbed off, Rowling keeps us interested by offering continued mystery, diversity, characters we can relate to and a palette of literary reference that gives resonance to her creation. You will cry at the end, but those tears may be because there will be no more Harry Potter books to read...well, for a while anyway.
