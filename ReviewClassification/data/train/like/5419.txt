6.0 stars. On my list of "All Time Favorite" novels. The epic scope of this series (e.g., a Galactic Empire spanning 25 million worlds and containing over a quadrillion people), the great characters, the fun story and the concept of psychohistory, which I think is one of the coolest concepts ever, make this an absolute must read for SF fans. It is just loads of fun. HIGHEST POSSIBLE RECOMMENDATION!!Winner: Hugo Award for Best All Time Series (The Foundation Trilogy) (1966)Voted onto the Locus List of All Time Best Science Ficiton Novels (4th)
