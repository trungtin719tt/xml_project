Loved the movie so much, but not so much love for the book. Some parts of the movie didn't stay true to the book which, I think, made the moviewaybetter. The book was a bittoosexist at times. I understand, though, that this was written in the 70s/80s so I let it slide. But I am still glad I have, finally,finallyread this since this is one of my most anticipated reads this year. My 100th book :)
