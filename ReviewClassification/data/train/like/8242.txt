In college I read an author I loved and can't find him. He wrote in the 20's in prose, and they called him the street poet. He didn't rhyme but made you feel his words. I thought Eliot might be that one. I'm not sure if I read him then but the poem amazed me. The more I read and write the more I understand and the deeper the pleasure. I read Eliot a couple years ago and hated it. I read him again this week and read in awe. His words branch off into hundreds of novels your mind creates. His imagery takes you into the very experience to see, feel, taste, touch. Wow. My favorite of Eliot's remains "The Hollow Men." I plan to read that next.
