"It comes to this," Tarrou said almost casually; "What interests me is learning how to become a saint.""But you don't believe in God.""Exactly! Can one be a saint without God? - that's the problem, in fact the only problem, I'm up against today"The Plaguemarks a significant change in Camus' view of ethics, and life itself, fromThe Stranger. Probably his best novel.InThe Thought and Art of Albert Camus, Thomas Hanna writesThe plague is evil and sin is giving in to this evil. Tarrou, in speaking for Camus,isspeaking of sin, butit is sin without God... evil is of this world, man is of this world, and sin is against a value which is of this world. God in no way figures in the problem.I've read it at least twice. Likely will again.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review:The Ecotechnic FutureNext review:The Copernican RevolutionMore recent review:2015 on GoodreadsPrevious library review:The FallNext library review:The Stranger
