Absolutely AMAZING! I stayed up to the wee hours of the morning because I couldn't put the book down, I had to know how it ended. I am in love with the Fuentes brothers and can't wait to read the third book of this series. Simone did an amazing job. I was quite skeptical about reading this book at first because I didn't know how Rules of Attraction could measure up to Perfect Chemistry well it exceeded my expectations. I think I prefer Carlos to Alex. Carlos' character was amazing, his whit and attitude was so well written and loved the banter between him and Kiara. I could go on for hours about why someone should read this book. It will for certain be on my favorites list and reading it a second or perhaps a third time is certainly not out of the question.
