I can't believe that I haven't reviewed this, because I remember really liking this book.I thoroughly enjoyed reading Obsidian, and I didn't think I was going to because when I read books about Aliens, I always picture the alien from the film Alien...and that's not a sexy image.Obsidian starts with our heroine, Katy Swartz moving to West Virginia to start over.As it turns out, the new house she moves into has a really hot neighbor.His name his Daemon Black. He's tall and has green eyes. Sounds perfect right? That is until he opened his mouth.Oh and not to forget that he's also an Alien.When I first read this book, I was a little freaked out with myself because I was falling for an Alien...Falling for someone like Christian Grey or Keiran Masters is considered fine, but when you read a book and fall for an Alien, you're kind of like 'wtf is wrong with me?'Now I really liked this book, and I don't read a lot of Science Fiction books.This book is a Paranormal Romance and Mystery.Obsidian has bad-ass characters, tension, it's pretty funny and has also a bit of sexual frustration between our main characters.The CharactersKaty was a very likable character.She's stubborn, strong, feisty and hilarious.And Daemon?I want a Daemon for myselfI love reading books with guys like Daemon.I don't know what it is with men who are arrogant, infuriating and mean.For me it makes the book more exciting.Jennifer Armentrout...you are a genius!
