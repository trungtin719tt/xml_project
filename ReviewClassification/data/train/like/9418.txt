Another book my mom gave me when I was having one of 'those' days. I never felt special growing up, much like Punchinello. I probably would have had lots of gray dots and no gold stars either! While the book was written for children to understand that God loves them no matter what, I was given the book when I was probably about 15 or 16. The message was still loud and clear - but I didn't see Eli as God... to me, he was my parents.This is another one of those books that I still have on the shelf in my apartment and take out to read when I feel a bit down. Similar to Dr. Seuss'sThe Sneetches,You Are Specialis definitely a story for anyone to read who questions why they're even here when they feel invisible to the world around them.
