This book is one of the best I have read in awhile for its length. It's pure genius.Who hasn't wanted do-overs in their life ? I would probably go back to when I started high school and make wiser decisions.I would have loved to have heard the conversations between Stephen King, his wife and their son, Author Joe Hill. His wife still stands with the theories that Oswald didn't act alone, and Joe Hill thought of another way to end the book.The way King describes the characters in this makes them very believable and ones you become attached to. The lead character is complex and often alone. I was often thinking to myself, "no, don't do that, do this." He is also the narrator of the story. Jake/George is told about a time travel mechanism by a friend where he can possibly save JFK from assassination and change the future. To reveal more would require spoilers.The strength of the story actually lies with the characters, and the bonds that they form. I felt their emotions just like I was there. I could taste the root beer in the frosted mug at the soda fountain counter.I think if people try to argue the "what ifs" and the politics of this book, you are missing the point. The book is long by some peoples standards but I thoroughly enjoyed every page. It was interesting the way King wrote fiction/non fiction/science fiction/love story all together in one book and it flowed without any effort. It keeps you guessing a lot of the time which I liked.Overall, this book is phenomenal. I can tell King did a lot of research on this book, but now I want to know more. This is a fast for the length of the book and I highly recommend it
