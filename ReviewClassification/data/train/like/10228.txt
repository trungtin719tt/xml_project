It just isn't possible for me to be objective about the Little House books. They were THE go to books for me as a child, and the comfort books as a teenager. This one is certainly written at a younger level, but I still loved reading about all of the work it took to run a farm - from making butter and cheese and straw hats, etc. Boy do I take a lot for granted. Anyway, I enjoyed it yet again! Perfect finals week comfort-reading :)
