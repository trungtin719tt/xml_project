I've read this multiple times. One of the true, original bad asses. 6 stars.OK. Very briefly (in part because I've been very busy), the Heaney version is THE version to read if you're looking for accessibility. Who would have ever thought that such a rough and tumble read would come out so smooth? And from a poet who is all knots, rough rhythms, and peat moss. But it is. What I particularly liked were the various important speeches. Clarity is key with this version, but with lots of nice poetic phrasing. What is lost however are the rough and choppy rhythms that have accompanied virtually all my other readings. My personal favorite still remains Ruth Lehmann's 1988 effort,Beowulf: An Imitative Translation. But Heany's version is a good one. And there's no reason not to have several versions of this kick ass tale.
