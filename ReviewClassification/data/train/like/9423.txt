The perfect book to read to a student who feels as though they are not good enough to fit in or are different from those around them. The moral of this story is that you don't have to be like everyone else. Each person has their own way of being special and the opinions of others do not define you. I am in love with this book. I feel like many children feel unwanted and they desire for someone to tell them they are cared about and are special. In our cruel world, it is too often that people are brought down for their differences and are judged based off someone else's standards. It is important for children to grow up understanding that they have just as much to offer as anybody surrounding them. This book will give them an inspirational boost to feel proud about themselves and special.
