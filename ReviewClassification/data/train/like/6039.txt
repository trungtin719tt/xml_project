Review to come and other reviews on my blog (bio)------------------------------------------------------------------------This was my first Sherlock Holmes I've read. I highly enjoyed it. These detective stories give me a real Autumn feeling and gets me all cozy.The story was great. I've read that some people already knew who the killer was, but I didn't. I was still surprised at the end when the case was solves and reviewed. It was a lot of fun to read in the kind of language style of that time, and to still feel like it fits in the modern world.The only problem I had was that I sometimes didn't know who was who again, because I felt like I didn't get a big enough introduction about the characters. That made the story sometimes a little hard to understand for me.:)
