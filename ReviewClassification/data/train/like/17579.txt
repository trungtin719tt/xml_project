This is the first book in the series that has an actual storyline, where there's an ancient evil that needs to be, and is eventually, dealt with in the end. The really amazing thing is that this series went two entire books before it even really needed to happen, and no one really seems to care, because the first two books are so entertaining without any real plotline tying all of the random events together in them. I mean, for a book that doesn't have a girl who discovered a way that everyone could just be happy without anyone needed to be nailed to anything first, it was okay, I guess. This book is actually probably my favorite in the series, because you get to find out the all important answer to the question "why did the bowl of petunias say 'oh no, not again?'" It's probably my favorite gag in the entire series. I don't know if Adams had that all planned out when he wrote the first book or not, but it goes back to a pretty funny joke, and then makes it even more funny. Just that combined with the flying that takes place afterward makes up my favorite scene in the entire series. And the Krikkit thing is just plain funny as hell too. Adams manages to make fun of not just those who don't understand the game of cricket, but those who understand and enjoy it all at the same time, which takes talent. Certainly recommend this one, and the whole series it's part of, to anyone who enjoys really well thought out comedy.
