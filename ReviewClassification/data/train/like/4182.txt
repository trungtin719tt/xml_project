"And so I discovered that it is not on our forgiveness any more than on our goodness that the world's healing hinges, but on His. When He tells us to love our enemies, He gives, along with the command, the love itself."This book breaks your heart in different ways - breaks your heart for the pain people suffered, the raw truth of the war, and for the inexpressible goodness of God, for there is no pit so deep that He is not deeper still.Recommended.
