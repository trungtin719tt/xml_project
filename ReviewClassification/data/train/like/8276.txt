Such a rich fantasy adventure full of unforgettable episodes - a boy-dragon, a Midas pool, invisible enemies, little Sea people, a fearless mouse, an enchanted table, the island where dreams come true and more. And above all Aslan. Truly a pleasure to read to my young children.The most unforgettable scene in this (and so worth remembering) is when Lucy magically overhears her friend gossiping about her and how that irrevocably changes their relationship - a thought-provoking reminder of the effects of gossip.
