A perfect book to buy for your early-teens little sister right when she starts showing interest in the opposite sex. Goes great in a Christmas bundle right along withTwilight,Gossip Girl, etc. Moms and pops and big brothers and sisters, make note! The holidays are right around the corner, after all...(view spoiler)[Mystical, intricate, luminous, dreamlike, a treasure trove of knowledge which could trap you in wikipedia searches for the whole of a grad school program, this collection gives and gives and then gives some more. To attempt toreallybreak it down based solely on a first pass, no matter how thoughtfully and slowly you attempted to absorb it, would be selling short Borges's expansive imagination, the breadth of his knowledge of the Humanities, and his remarkable skills as a wordsmith and miner of the subconscious, of hypnotic states and fantasy worlds, religious ecstasy and terror, and human struggle and redemption (for starters). This collection is one to be revisited multiple times, as their will always be another layer buried underneath each previous read's unearthed gems. Though each short story, essay, and parable is deceptively short, and in fact the entire collection itself is rather on the slim side, don't expect to just plow right through it in a day or two. Well, unless for some strange reason you just really want to read something without actually reading it. These pieces will make you think, they will make you dream, they will make your head spin, you will read and reread and often stop to just simmer for awhile, and on and on I could ramble...in fact, I can't think of a more perfect title thanLabyrinths. They are. (In the best way.)(hide spoiler)]Makes a great beach read, too!
