"Masterpiece" doesn't cut it. It's a work of art. To be honest, I didn't even know this was a book until I found it in the library, but now it's one of my favorites (let's put it this way -- I read it in one day). I love Gothic novels, but this one tops everything I've ever read. I'll admit it's not for everyone, but I have no idea what people mean when they say it's hard to read. The characterizations are so vivid, it was like being sucked into the pages. From the follies of the opera managers, to the frustration of Raoul, to the courage of Christine, there's such life in this story that you can't help but marvel at the stark contrast of Erik's world. It is one of the very few books that actually made me cry, though the ending of the book was more merciful (to me) than the play. Long story short, if you haven't read it, do it now!
