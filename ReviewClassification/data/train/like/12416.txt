Jonathan Franzen, you bespectacled metrosexual, you. What a great book. 4.5 stars! Now hang with me, I know this book is pretty divisive.HERE'S WHY YOU SHOULD READ THIS BOOK: at some point in your life, you will make a very difficult decision on how to provide medical/hospice care for an aging, ailing family member. Most likely that family member will be a parent (or a Baby Boomer), and that decision will not be accepted--not by the member, not by your siblings. The decision will most likely occur at an inconvenient time. But it will have to be made, nevertheless, and it will rip your soul apart.The Correctionshas little to do with the final decision made by the siblings regarding their father. But, it has everything to do with the characteristics of the adult siblings, and why that decision is ultimately so difficult. This is like real life, in gory detail...like reading about your friends, their secret lurchings, their unusual compunctions, and their sexual errors.There's 3 kids. Despite the same nuclear upbringing in a small Midwest town, each kid is radically different. They're all adults now and immersed in their lives, their 30's, their most productive years. They don't want ailing parents; they don't want this decision foisted on them; they don't want to convene and talk about this uncomfortable topic; they especially don't want to revisit the past, which is painful to them. This story, then, is told by each child and their parents, reminiscing in very long, seamless chapters, moving eloquently between present and past. It's funny, sad, gross, revealing, and probably biographical for most of us. Franzen's writing reminds me a lot of John Updike's, his awesome way of slicing mundane Americana, and graphically exposing--like a cut of shank meat--the pallid bone, the waxy gristle, the flaccid muscle, and the thin layer of skin with its hair, glands, wrinkles, and dead color.Oh, how we grow up and lose our innocence. I was a boy once, and loved Christmas in our cramped apartment. Of course, I didn't think it was cramped; and I didn't think we were struggling for money; and I didn't think our traditions would crystallize into personal habits that years hence would drive me nuts. I was a boy once, and respected my siblings and thought my dad was a hero. Of course, I didn't think my dad would ever routinely piss his pants and be so friggin' hard-headed that I'd rather chew bricks than hear his unrequested advice; and I didn't think my siblings would grow up and do THAT; and certainly there's things I've done that, revealed, would embarrass me beyond contact with the family. Yes, this is life, and Franzen has revealed it for us in highly readable prose.The key to this 4.5-star novel is its careful and authentic transcription of real life. Have you met these characters? The youngest boy is fired from a great university gig for having relations with a student, and spends the rest of his time barely solvent but chasing money wherever it pools. The middle sister is swept away from school in big city life, and bumps around in the food industry, eventually beginning an ill-conceived relationship and an ill-conceived business. The oldest boy, the martyr, the reluctant sibling leader, is sub-clinically depressed and is used like a pliable tool by his unfaithful wife and spoiled kids in their middle income exurb. The parents are stuck so deep in wagon-wheel ruts that their moods, manners and characteristics are predictable, routinized and lifeless. Each family member is explored in detail. Each person is handled judiciously. Each character acts realistically--albeit a bit zany at times for effect. Franzen investigates the riddle of family life and why we grow so far apart. And then, suddenly, dad has dementia, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's and we all have to come together again for tough decisions. And then, when we're together, it's all banana hands and left feet. We're retards in our parent's old home.Franzen's writing leans a little toward being hip or pop-cultured (and perhaps a bit oversexed, even scatological), but once you understand his rhythm, once you engage the hyper-descriptive and lengthy sentences, you're in for a ride. His narration is exquisite and his backstories are lurid and savory. The adult siblings are leading lives that are wholly believable (except the bit about Latvia, ostensibly done for humor). If you can't connect with these characters in some way, through some experience, then you've grown up in ways and in places I've never heard about--you've grown up in ways that are so foreign to me that I'm scared to know you. Franzen nails it, real life, again and again. Sure, there's a stretch here and an exaggeration there, but the bottom line to this story is that you can't run from your history, that life is made of floundering starts and failures, that you oughta give folks more space to be themselves, and that your parents will always love you (mostly because they don't know you).The Correctionswon the National Book Award, and I hope it won hands-down. From a rather unknown writer, this is the Great American Novel, and then Franzen drops back into obscurity. I can't wait for his next book. But, I understand this kind of writing isn't churned out annually like that other crap you see people reading at the beach. This book hit the right note with me. I laughed, I cried, I hugged my kids, I spanked my wife, c'est la vie. I recommend it to all Updike fans.New words: styptic, cupric, toque, dhoti, ailanthus, plangent
