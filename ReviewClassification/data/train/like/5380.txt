I cried a lot out of happiness reading this book....................The tears flowed out of my eyes without me noticing them...........The story begins well and is lively and after certain chapters (after the first half, to be precise), the novel contains only pure and innocent happiness. Each chapter in the second half gets better and the happiness begins and flows through the chapters making the reader very sentimental and longing for such lovely landscapes, friendships, relationships, and happiness.I do not want to say anything about the plot. I just only want to make some observations.This is a lovely book for the kids and as well as for the adults.For Kids:It will teach them first and foremost that Love is the foundation for happiness of man.It will teach them to establish lovely relationships. It will teach them to love all.It will teach them to love the landscapes, the environments and the animals.It will teach them to pray.It will give them much to cheer about.For Adults:It will speak to them of forgiveness.It will speak to them of the vanity of riches, or rather it will teach them the right usage of riches.It will teach them to appreciate the richness of relationships and the expansive nature.It will take them to their innocent childhood memories.It will give them much to cheer about.Final Note:It is a fact that nothing much is known about the author of HEIDI, Johanna Spyri. In her lifetime when she was asked to write her autobiography, she replied thus:"The external path of my life is very simple, and there is nothing special to be mentioned. My inner life was full of storms, but who can describe it?"And even if a star is very far and its details are hard to get by, still its shining splendor is more than enough for our limited vision. J. Spyri will always be remembered as the author of HEIDI and that is the greatest recognition. Thank you Johanna Spyri for giving us HEIDI.
