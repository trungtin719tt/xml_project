I read another review on here before I read the book, and the person said that the book was "boring" because this was just two people fighting over a "house."Actually, it's much more than that, and I thought the house served as a symbol for each person involved. This story gave the reader an inside look into an immigrant family, showing that they are "just like us," fighting for a place in this sometimes disgusting country. The house for Mr. Behrani served as a symbol of "making it" in America. He was working two jobs but lying to his family about the type of work he was doing. He had come from a place where he had been considered a high rank, and I think he felt that he was failing his family and this house was his chance to make things better. For Kathy, I thought the house was the only stable thing in her life - her husband had left her, she fell back into drinking, etc. Although she kept saying it was her dad's house and he had left it to her and her brother, I think she was more worried about her brother seeing her as the failure he'd always seen her as.The intensity, passion, and chemistry of Les and Kathy's relationship was there (for me) from the paragraph they met and carried through to the very last page. (I couldn't quite figure out over what time span this book took place but it wasn't a very long period of time. Was it like a week or a little more?)I had no idea that the book was going to take the turn that it did. At first I was upset about it, but then I realized it was the only way it could end. No one got the house. No one had a happy ending. I was left with a few questions, but they probably couldn't have been answered anyway.
