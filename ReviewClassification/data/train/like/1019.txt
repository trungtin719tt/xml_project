3.5"There warn't no home like a raft, after all."I mean, at the beginning there's a notice that reads"Persons attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot."How am I supposednotto fall in love, pray tell?This book swarms withkey issuesof Twain's -today's- America -world-, all properly backed up by irresistiblehumourand irony. As I've said elsewhere before,The Adventures of Huckleberry Finnis another of those books that, in my opinion, with their sole existence make the world a better place.
