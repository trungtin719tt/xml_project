Having read Jane Eyre recently for the first time, ...it was suggested I read Villette....A fantastic Kindle-Freebie!!!I thought this story was terrific ...equally as good as Jane Eyre.Lucy Snowe....lonely, introverted, .....and somewhat emotionally unavailable....it's easy to feel empathy towards her... harder to understand what she is thinking. - yet...she was easy to relate to. I could understand her struggles of bumping up against isolation -- and doubting who she was.Bronte touches on that insecure spot inside us which we all feel at times through Lucy.Dramatic storytelling -lovely prose -and filled with thought and emotions. There were a couple of scenes where I was laughing out loud --at the same time there was sadness knowing that Lucy suffered. Her heart and spirit were good - big- yet without having a vivacious personality, or being an electric extroverted charmer....her gifts, intelligence, we're not easily visible. As the reader...we are privileged to look deeper into her soul --We see an endearing woman - a woman with moral integrity, inner strength....but sad!Beautiful and heartbreaking.
