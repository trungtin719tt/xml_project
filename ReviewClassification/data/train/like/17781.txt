The second installment of Bloodfever is intense, powerful, dramatic and clever.We see a great deal of character growth from out favorite characters as well as a progression in the plot, albeit a small one.The writing is, as always, stylish and immersive. The world is complicated, mysterious and intriguing.Overall, this book is a fantastic second installment in what is an amazing, refreshing and enjoyable series.PS. I'm either going to kill Barrons sooner or later, or do very, very, very naughty things to him.
