"it's an old woman who owns this house, i figure. ignored and aging and drugged out old women, older and more invisible to the world every minute, they must not wear a lot of make-up. not go out to fun hot spots. not boogie to a party froth. my breath smells hot and sour inside my veils, inside the damp layers of silk and mesh and cotton georgette i lift for the first time all day; and in the mirrors, i look at the pink reflection of what's left of my face.mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest one of all?the evil queen was stupid to play snow white's game. there's an age where a woman has to move on to another kind of power. money, for example. or a gun.""'anything you can do is boring and old and perfectly okay. you're safe because you're so trapped inside your culture. anything you can conceive of is finebecause you can conceive of it. you can't imagine any way to escape. there's no way you can get out,' brandy says.brandy says, 'and if you can find any way out of our culture, then that's a trap too. just wanting to get out of the trap reinforces the trap.'brandy says, 'the best way is not to fight it, just go. don't be trying all the time to fix things. what you run from only stays with you longer. when you fight something, you only make it stronger.she says, 'don't do what you want.' she says, "do what you dont' want. do what you're trained not to want.'it's the opposite of following your bliss.brandy tells me, 'do the things that scare you the most'"this is not my favorite or the most entertaining palahniuk book to read, but it is the one that i think has the best story. the character has the most meaningful journey. she actually resolves things. she comes to a conclusion.yes all palahniuk books are largely the same. his characters rage against the machine in more or less clever and shocking ways, and they demonize the normal and expected thing to do.what most people don't realize though is that palahniuk's books are all actually about the difference between what we think will make us happy and what will actually make us happy. in his books he explores that concept through compulsion, disaster, impossible desires, and self-imposed suffering. since that cognitive gap between intended happiness and actual happiness is something that's hugely important to how i think about my life, i am one of those people who like palahniuk more than i "should." this book explores the concept of happiness versus expected happiness more overtly than any of his other books.the characters in this book are incredibly selfcentered(something that i also really like abouthaunted). while the main character in fight club wants to destroy the infrastructure of society, the main character in invisible monsters wants to break free of her own expectations of herself.becoming disfigured and losing her modeling career provides a backdrop for the main character to examine her concept of identity. the other characters she goeson the roadwith allow her and the reader to examine gender identity and sexual identity.all the characters in the book have vague and shifting moral identities, which interact with their other identities in interesting ways. this gives the reader a chance to notice what expectations they have of each character and how those were wrong or correct, at the same time examining the accuracy of the characters' own expectations of themselves.the first half of this book always bores me a bit, but i think the payoff is worth the setup. for me, there's more catharsis in this book than any of his others.
