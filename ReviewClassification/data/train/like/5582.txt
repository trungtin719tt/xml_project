Stephenie Meyer has nuthin' on this woman (...understatement!). Harris has in one pinky all the talent of the aforementioned hack, and her huge fan base must take note. "Dead Until Dark" is a loud middle finger to all those in deep love (&amp; therefore those with questionable tastes) with the "Twilight" series.This book reminds me that not all fiction has to be poetry. This one has a clear plot, it ties together all loose ends. It is enthralling, addictive, everything one wants in the PERFECT paperback novel. If only I knew about it before the HBO series "True Blood" (on which this book, book 1, is based) I would have definitely watch the series, but its occurred vice versa. The series explores characters, has more sex &amp; violence (duh, HBO) but does not touch the same ground this one cleverly hides within its first-look junk-lit verse.Sookie is the Everygirl, clever, lost, in love, found, frightened but curious and courageous. Bill the Vampire lacks the Lestatness of those that came after the Anne Rice novel, but it's okay. At least he's not one-dimensional like Edward Cullen.Everyone here, it seems, has secrets. The theme.There are dark inhabitants of the world, some don't have to be vampires or shapeshifters but humans with deep flaws. Once the mystery is solved (I solved this one way before the climax), this theme comes to light. I wish I was a writer, important, like Charlaine Harris.
