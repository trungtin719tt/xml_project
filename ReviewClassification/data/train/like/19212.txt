I can only speak of this book in hushed, reverential tones. This is one of my most, most, most favorite books, which I've been reading for years and still have not finished. It's like an endless diary of daily life, written by the strangest, most deleriously unhappy (but sometimes happy), brilliant (but sometimes simple), intensely thoughtful old man.Pessoais best known for writing poetry using "heteronyms," meaning that essentially he had multiple personalities who all were writers. He never intended to publishThe Book of Disquiet(or so I've heard); when he died, he left a trunk in his apartment filled with a billion little scraps of paper detailing his observations on everything. Then someone put them in some kind of order and made a stunning book.I think each edition of the book has them in a different order, but get the Exact Change edition, if you're gonna get it. Their books are so gorgeous (I have a whole shelf of only Exact Change books, because any other books put next to them look shabby by comparison), and I'm pretty sure they need your money. Plus that's the edition I have, so it must be the best.
