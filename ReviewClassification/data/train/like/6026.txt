I'd been toying with the idea of reading books in French. I can understand the language - but as for speaking it, well here's another ball game. I read part of this edition in my class when I was 13 years old. I read when the hound was racing towards its would be victim.Would be victim...due to Sherlock Holmes' intervention. Holmes is a very fantastic, very popular character. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, though he claimed to loathe the character, had a hidden fondness for Holmes. The author was furious with the treatment of his creation in the hands of Maurice Leblanc, who was the creator of Arsene Lupin.Movie and TV adaptations come and go, but the purity of Sherlock Holmes is like vapor to the uninitiated. Us fans know secretly what makes him tick. But we cannot transcribe ourselves in certain terms. We lack the knowledge how to pin the exactitude of Homes as portrayed in the original 4 novels and 56 short stories. Same for the directors and wannabe authors who wish to ape Doyle.This was an experiment. And I think I succeeded in enjoying the story, known as it was to me in an earlier reading in English. The Hound of the Baskervilles was really wildly successful only in retrospective. Now it is part of the legacy of the detective. The meerschaum pipe and the hunting apparel are nearly part of folklore, and I enjoyed visiting it thoroughly. Highly recommended.
