I should have realised, and acknowledged beforehand that, historical fiction books don't have happy endings. In fact, it's the complete opposite.This book, heart-rending as it is, deserves to be hailed as one of the greatest books of the world history. Indeed, I would, by all means, recommend it to everyone with a mind of curiosity and hunger for knowledge. This book will help you understand how cruel and evil humans can be because as far as I'm concerned, wars are born because of the misunderstanding between us people living in different countries.So please, just please, don't ever let this disastrous, destructive thing called war happen again, not anytime soon, not EVER. It is just unbearable and impossible for the human kind to remain their existence.
