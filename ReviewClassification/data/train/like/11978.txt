I read this book once beforebut read it again yesterday---with the new preface by his wife Marion Wiesel.I did not plan on reading the whole thing--I just wanted to read the new Preface---but then while sitting around (with sick people in the house)--I just dived into the horror again.....(with expanded thoughts than in years pass).
