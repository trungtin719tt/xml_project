"I'll never forget you; and this I know - if God made room in heaven for all good dogs, I know he made a special place for you."This is my first go-round with this fine, and affecting classic. I thoroughly enjoyed it, though I hope to never again hear the wordentrailsrepeated so many times . . . particularly in a book aimed at younger readers.
