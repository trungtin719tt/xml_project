Abdullah 10, is very close to his little sister Pari 3, his poor family living inside a mud house, in Shadbagh , a small village of Afghanistan, days walk from Kabul the capital, but the boy's whole life is taking care of this precious girl child, washing her, keeping the sister clean, playing and giving the baby things, reciting poems, taking the tiny female on rambles, doesn't matter, just content to be together, they are like twins...His kind mother has died and the stepmother Parawana , is indifferent to their needs, besides she has a child of her own a male... to occupy her time , the surviving proud, strict parent Saboor ignores the two, too busy scratching out an existence , providing for his family's survival in the farm fields, just another laborer during the early 1950's trying to prevent starvation to his dependents . However an unbelievable event happens Pari is sold to a rich, childless couple, Suleiman Wahdati, a very private man even a recluse, and his sophisticated, beautiful, fun loving wife Nila, half French, she likes to have drinking parties, where everyone smokes in this traditional muslim society, at home, still feeling uncomfortable in such an intensely conservative country...though in Kabul, an unhappy marriage obviously ; the "adoption" arranged by Abdulla's stepmother's brother, "Uncle" Nabi... He, all his life regrets the idea, ( a big mistake that cripples his ambitions) to buy this pretty, talented girl, the chauffeur who works for them, the wealthy pair, in the large, frightening, cosmopolitan city of ever expanding Kabul...Abdullah howls in anguish ...the only person he loves has been taken cruelly away...it will change the destiny of many in the future. This third novel by Khaled Hosseini can't match the previous others, about the lives of scattered families and friends , in Afghanistan, France, Greece, and the United States... resembles more a bunch of short stories loosely connected , than a real novel, he is like an intense juggler with too many toys in the air, his thoughts divided, unfocused, uneasy , only so long can he keep these objects floating above, before they come crashing down to the floor causing havoc...it is a shame. If the writer had stayed with Abdullah and Pari as the main characters this would have been a great book... bored authors like to do different things, experiment, change their style , hoping to surprise readers but instead hurt the product not fatally here, it is still quite good, yet a slow puncture wound proves costly and the victim is us ...taking a long time to recover, nevertheless it hurts...people including writers are resilient, the future can be bright. Another day arriving and optimism coming with it...
