Friedrich Nietzscheestablishes in his best-known book the bridge of man with his primary nature. More than a parody of the metaphysical imagery, the book states that man has undergone to an abstract force, invisible. Zarathustra reveals to man that life is ruled by chance and that the decline of human nature comes in the expectation that there will be something or someone directing it in life.The teachings ofSocratesare fought here because life for Nietzsche is a force, not an objective. The revelation of Zarathustra is precisely this: power, vigor and transit. Movements that bring back to human nature the desire that everything be sacred, everything revolves in an absolute circle, everything must be blessed. This book, poetic, brings us an enthusiastic Nietzsche, taken by his favorite god: art.Lisbon Book-Fair 2017.
