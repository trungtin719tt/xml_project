Almost four whole months into 2015 and I'vefinallyread my first four-star book. You can always trust Toni Morrison to deliver even when you think all hope is lost. I thinkSong of Solomonis my favourite Morrison novel thus far. This novel just flows with greatness. I feel that I enjoyed this book more than let's say,Beloved, because the time period in which this is set (the 1930s through to the 60s) is an era with which I'm relatively familiar. She references the murder of Emmett Till and the rise of Malcolm X for instance. I felt more of aconnectbecause of the historical time setting. In many ways I found that this novel almost mirrors the early chapters ofThe Autobiography of Malcolm X, I'm not sure if this was intentional though. I really found this novel to be "unputdownable", more so than the other Morrison novels that I've read. If I were to choose a good starting place for Morrison virgins, I'd chooseSong of Solomon. I really enjoyed this one.
