An extraordinary work, equal to the finest works by Shakespeare. A good friend of mine directed the production of an iPad app, that includes Eliot's own readings, other famous readings, study guides, historical pictures and commentary, critical reviews, etc. Truly a masterwork on a masterpiece.The Wasteland - an App for iPad...complete audio readings of the poem, also synchronised to the text, by T. S. Eliot himself (readings from two periods in his life) as well as Ted Hughes, Alec Guinness, Viggo Mortensen and Jeremy Irons with Eileen Atkins
