I read this book in high school and loved it for the story. That was in the 1960's when apartheid was in full swing and Mandela was in prison. This time I loved the story (fortunately some of the racial and political problems have been solved) but was also able to appreciate the beautiful, lyrical prose. I have shed many tears while reading this, most in last section of the book, which is the section that brings some hope to the situation in a 1940's South Africa that is pre-apartheid but a country that is mostly inhabited by poor blacks under the thumb of a few rich whites. Despite the inequities which are abundantly shown, this book also embodies courage, compassion and Christian values. On a personal level, I thought many times while reading this on the aptness of the title for the situation in my country today. Cry, The Beloved Country for the state of race relations and political civility that seem to be tearing us apart in this presidential election season.
