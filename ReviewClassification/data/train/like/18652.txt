[4.5 Stars] What is it with third books in urban fantasy series? Seriously. Magic Strikes by Ilona Andrews was one of my favorites from the series, and it was the third book in the series. Iron Kissed is no different, though with a catch. I'll get to that at the end.I loved how we got more fae in this book. It was cool learning more about them, and can we all just collectively acknowledge how much of a badass Zee is? Seriously if him and Aunt B from Kate Daniels series ever had a conversation, that would be one hell of a meeting!I also love Mercy, her character development, how she thinks, just her entire decision process is amazing. She goes through so much in this book, so freaking much, and I admit it was a little hard to read at times. I'm not going to spoil why it got so dark, but needless to say it soured a little bit of my feelings concerning this book, makes me a little less likely to immediately pick up book 4, and it's the reason I had to knock off at minimal a half star rating. I loved this book, but the ending.. well. It's difficult is all I'm going to say. I know I've gushed a lot but know that I too am slightly conflicted by my gushing.Sorry for the weird review but I wanted to keep this spoiler-free... anywho... hopefully we see some Stefan in the next book... hopefully? may be?
