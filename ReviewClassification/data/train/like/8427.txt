"None of those other things makes a difference. Love is the strongest thing in the world, you know. Nothing can touch it. Nothing comes close. If we love each other we're safe from it all. Love is the biggest thing there is."I believe that this suspenseful novel would also appeal to fans ofTo Kill a Mockingbird.
