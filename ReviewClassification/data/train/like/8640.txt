I wasn't sure that I would like this book as much as the first two after seeing some spoilers, but I absolutely loved it. It makes me so happy to finally have found a book series set primarily in Scotland which isn't stereotypical and ridiculous about us Scots.The character development in this series is brilliant and it's always great when characters from previous books appear. This book series has so many intertwining and shocking plots while also focusing on Claire and Jamie's relationship, which I love.Once again I am blown away by the level of research that clearly went into writing this book, I love the way the book characters are fitted so realistically into real historical events.As this is book three I can't say much without giving spoilers, but as the name suggests a voyage takes place, and I was shocked by how much I liked it. It doesn't matter where in the world our characters are, the setting is written and described so well you almost feel as if you are there.The plot was so fast paced in this book, in every chapter something new and exciting happened. There were heartbreaking moments which made me want to cry and also amazing moments where the plot came together so brilliantly.I will say that there was one small plot in the book which I thought was absolutely ridiculous, but the other 1000 pages were brilliant so I will still give it 5 stars.(This was my 50th book of 2015, yay!)
