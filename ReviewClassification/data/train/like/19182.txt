If I hadn't readFlow Down Like Silver: Hypatia of AlexandriaandThe Secret MagdaleneI would have given this book 5 stars. It's everything you'd want in a novel. But it doesn't carry the immense weight of the other two. If I hadn't just readHoudini HeartI wouldn't know how innovative this writer is. China Blues is a first novel. I've read somewhere it was meant to fit into the mainstream. It does. It's a book anyone could read. I honestly believe that if Longfellow didn't write so damned well, her books would be bestsellers. This Longfellow book is the stuff of bestsellers. Why it isn't (or wasn't since this is a beautiful reissue) beats me.
