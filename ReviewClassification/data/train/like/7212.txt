Not to my surprise, many questions that are thrown at Richard Dawkins by the creationist on debate panels have been answered as it is in this book. If only people read this by themselves!It was fascinating how the "missing links" was explained by Darwin in a context of geology. Most importantly he was indicating towards Tectonics (that was brought into light many years after darwin's time by Alfred Wegener). Clearly, Darwin was way ahead of his contemporaries.I knew it took him years to publish his work (arguably, partially because of psychosomatic dissonance), but the intense work on gathering information and years of research bolsters his point. He indeed wanted to be very sure of the theory. I am amazed by darwin's thought process that seems very instinctive to anyone who grew up studying about evolution ... however, being the forerunner in joining the dots on the same is very nonintuitive which marks his brilliance.Highly recommended to the Creationists.
