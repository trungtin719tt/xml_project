I found this book on my mother's book shelf and, already knowing the film, was very interested in also reading the book itself. It fascinated me much more than the films were able to, even despite the actors' stunning performances. The characters were well-developed, the plot was convincing, and the way the protagonist was turned into a criminal had her still left so likeable.I know this book already has hundreds of reviews about how wonderful it is, but I can nothing but support those opinions. If anyone looks for an interesting new book about a strong female protagonist, I can only recommend it to him. This book is so worth its read.
