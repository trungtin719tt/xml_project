I just read this book from cover to cover.I have no idea how to rate it.It is the worst book I've read.I would never be able to recommend it,because I hated it.It's ripped my heart in two.It'll make you think of losing the one person who means the most to you.Or it'll make you think of those you've already lost.It's not ahappybook, but it's animportantone.
