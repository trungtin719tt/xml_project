This is the first book in the Little House Series, and somewhat overlooked due to the popularity of the second book,Little House on the Prairie. I've read both and liked both; this volume being a wonderful introduction to Laura and the Ingalls familly. I didn't read this series as a child, but as an adult I've come to appreciate it's beauty, and it's importance in the canon of American Children's Literature. Some may say this is too simple for adults to appreciate, and starting out it seems that way, but the more you read the more you realize that Ingall's style is perfect for this type of story. I'm glad I started the series and I look forward to reading more.Revised January 2018.
