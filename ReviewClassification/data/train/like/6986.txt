3.75Ifinallyread this classic! (It's about time) Which means I'llfinallyunderstand all the references in books and movies that derive from this novel. I mean, it always bothered me that I hadn't read this, so I'm glad to be able to say: Yes, I've readInferno.It's not a perfect 4 stars because there were some parts I genuinely didn't understand. Also, the unique but rather choppy writing style wasn't my favorite. Honestly, if my edition didn't have pictures, I'm sure I would've been much more confused. At least, with the pictures, I could see what I wassupposedto be imagining. It's difficult writing, in my defense! However, when I was understanding the text fully - the imagery was flawless and deep. Very dark stuff for that time-period, for sure.Overall, this was unique and original. Everything I expected it to be. Only, it wasn't asgoodas I'd hoped. Oh well. Still enjoyed it quite a lot!
