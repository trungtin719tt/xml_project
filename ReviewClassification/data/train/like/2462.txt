WrensReads Review:When your friend comes over with eight Dr. Seuss books, you read them.Everyone knows this one, it is probably his best work.Cat in the Hat. The Cat that comes over, ruins your house, gives your pet fish a heart attack and let's your kids do whatever they want because you aren't home.Lots of rhymes. Lots of funny. Lots of things that hop like a bunny.. I'm stopping. I am not a Seuss. I wish I was a Seuss. Then I could only talk in rhymes, which would be kind of fun.WrensReads|Goodreads|Twitter|Instagram
