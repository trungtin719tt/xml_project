I probably would have had a different opinion of the book had I read it before I saw the movie but...I liked the movie as well as the book for the courage it portrays in a fight against prejudices. There is so much of racism in the World today, that Vianne's fight for the Gypsies to be accepted in that little town comes as a breath of fresh, heady air, much like Vianne herself.I also liked the idea of good fun in a very tight, moralistic society, the entire town seemed to have let their hair down and had fun. Good food, lots of music and dancing and tons of Chocolate too. It was as if on that Easter the town had renewed itself. There is always a catalyst on such occasions and Vianne was the flute of champagne in that uptight little town, opening a lot of minds and sweeping away the cobwebsWhat a beautiful book.
