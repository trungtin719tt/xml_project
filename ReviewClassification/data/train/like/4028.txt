I had tried to read J.R.R. Tolkien'The Silamarillionmultiple times in the past (and always unsuccessfully) and had basically given up, but I finally did manage to realise that I was attempting to read it the wrong way; I was trying to readThe Silmarillionlike I have read and with pleasure reread LOTR, as a story, an epic story, of course, but still first and foremost as a story. Now whileThe Silmarillionis of course also partially a story, it is (at least for me) first and foremost a religious type document, a biblical, mythological account of the Elder Days of Middle Earth. So this time, I readThe Silmarillionthe way I used to read my Bible and how I have also approached Hesiod'sTheogonyand other tomes on Greek, Roman and Norse mythology (perusing small bits and pieces as needed and desired and following along via audiobook at the same time if possible). And I do know this might indeed and in fact sound a bit strange, I actually tried singing some of the parts to myself. And yes, I will likely have to rereadThe Simarillionsometime soon, because there is just no way I am going to be able to keep all of the different names etc. clear in my head (and I kind of also wish I had taken notes). But for a first full and complete read, I can only say, wow. As good as LOTR, but also very very different, and I honestly and strongly do believe that in order to truly appreciate, savour and enjoy what J.R.R. Tolkien has created with and inThe Silmarilliona totally different and novel approach and method of reading are necessary and required (forThe Silmarillionjust does not work as a typical novel, since it is not in any manner a typical novel, and heck, it is not even a typical epic for that matter either).
