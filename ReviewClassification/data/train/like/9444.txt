I had somewhat of an idea of what this book was about before I ever started it. I am sure this will piss some people off...but if you are more concerned with the corporate "takers", more concerned about you, or your parents investments, care more about being the "haves",and could care less about the "leavers" or the "have nots" you will not "get" this book. You will not like it....If you care about the leeches in this world robbing us of our environment for business, like the Kochs brothers,for example, you won't like this book.If you care about the environment and about the "leavers",and making sure our descendents will have an earth to live and thrive on due to protecting our environment, you will "get" this book,and give it the high ratings it deserves. If you are more concerned about mankind , as a whole, instead of greed,and to make the mighty buck, you will get this book.The style was difficult to grasp at first,and if you stopped at 100 pages,and didn't finish this book, you missed it and all its glory. The discussions between the characters is all leading up to what's important , what's truly important in this world, which is having a world at all.....instead of the Koch brothers,and others pouring chemicals into our air, water, our soil, our food, to make more money instead of allowing the earth to thrive as it should. Monsanto,and other companies should be ashamed. WE should be ashamed for allowing it.So, that's my take on it. Read it, or start it again, if you dare.....if you have an open mind....and if you really want a healthy place for yourself &amp; your descendants to live on our planet.....I truly wonder if it's already too late...... then I think the point of the novel is....what are we gonna do about it now to try to solve our problems due to what we've already done,and continue to do to our home??
