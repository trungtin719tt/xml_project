Wow!!!!!One of my all time faves, hands down....Best writing and characterization I've read in a long time! (Not to mention best horror book--ever.) I am in awe of Lindqvist's ability to write, it is impossible for me to enjoy a book without great writing and the translation was so spot on it did not read like one at all.Sweden, a place I've never been, became real to me without having to put much of my imagination to work. The streets, stores, housing, woods--everything was laid out so well, as if I was there. And the characters, there were so many of them that I thought I'd be unable to remember them all. Yet, not only could I remember them, they each became very human through his excellent writing. At first I couldn't understand how all these storylines mattered but they came together perfectly, and I was able to follow everything as if I was right alongside each of them, and because they were so real to me it became hard to dislike many of them (except a few-one in particular!) despite all of their flaws. (If you are not a very empathetic person, I can see standing back and judging almost everyone in this book as abadperson--the alcoholics, the jobless, the terribly lost and lonely people, etc. To me that didn't happen one bit...except for the bullies....and the other ONE(view spoiler)[it involves pedophilia(hide spoiler)], because they are human...made so by the amazing writing....it did make me sad for them, but in no way did I find them deserving of my judgement, instead I was hoping strongly for their survival and much better days ahead.)This was a complex story made simple to read through Lindqvist's superior ability. This is exactly what a vampire book should be.....but it's also so much more.The story of Eli and Oskar of course took center stage, but the stories of everyone else in the book drew me in as well, especially Oskars mother, and Tommy and his mother. Lacke and Virginia.... The narration throughout the entire book was extremely realistic as well, not once did it feel strained; the conversations were so perfectly written, the way people actually speak; and I could always feel how the characters were feeling. I have found that very rare in books...Lindqvist possesses a magic that is released when you read his words.There were gross, stomach curdling parts...no one has made me that disgusted by some of the acts committed in years. (This is a book for true horror lovers only!) But, there was also tenderness, a caring for others, and a desire in the reader to see Eli stay "alive"----no matter what had to be done, because we've learned Eli's sad past :(It is very very late---and I promised to reward myself by watching theSwedish movieversion as soon as I was finished, so I will have to return and make a better review....at this moment I don't want the story to end---and I know when the movie is over I'm going to feel lost without Eli and Oskar....I want a sequel (and a long one)!!! How do you move on to another book after this?Okay...I've watched both versions of the movie (so glad i waited until after the book!) The American one...Sucks. The Swedish one is great--on it's own I would have loved it!....But, like all movies based on books--even excellent ones like this--it leaves far too much out. Make sure to watch the right movie--AFTER reading the book! ... by the way...I'm still grieving my loss of Oskar and Eli...Finally--the title is from a Morrisey song--as well as a quote at the beginning of this book...love that! It seems he's a huge fan...not only in this book. I hope to find more excellent books by this author, now....and hoping he's working on a big, fat sequel; the smallish sequel in the bookLet the Old Dreams Dieleaves plenty (tons) of room for onel!
