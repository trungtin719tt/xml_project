It's generally accepted thatI, Claudiusis one of best Roman historical novels ever written. Given this, it has to be assumed that amount of research thatRobert Gravesdid for this book would have to have been prodigious.Now, this is a novel and not an historical textbook. And if only half of it is accurate it's still a miracle that the Romans were able to create an Empire that would, to this very day, influence world history.The life of Claudius is told by Claudius, himself, as he reads his memoirs to the reader. And what a story it is.Being born into either the Julian or Claudian families was not something you would wish on your worst enemy. Ninety percent of either family usually ended up being brutally murdered or poisoned at a young age.The ruling families were despotic to the extreme. Every cide known to man was committed by them. Patricide, matricide, infanticide. Their sexual proclivities were only limited by their imaginations. They were either all mad or psychopaths, or both.Claudius was considered to be an idiot by the rest of his family because he was lame and had a speech impediment. Ironically Claudius was probably the most normal member of his family.There's not much here about military campagnes, the topic is touched but not in any detail.This is more about the hunger of power and the excesses that people are prepared to go to achieve it. Achieving power is only half of the battle. Holding on to it is the other half.Prepare for a blood bath.Highly recommended for lovers of historical fiction.
