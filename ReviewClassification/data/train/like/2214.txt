Flowers For Algernon is undeniably one of the saddest or heart-wrenching novel I've read so far. There are numerous times that some parts of this book that made me teary eyed, especially on how Charlie was maltreated by his own mother and younger sister, and by his colleagues in the bakery.This novel was first published on the late 50's, thus the people narrated during that time treated people with down syndrome differently. I cannot say that those who had this genetic disorder nowadays no longer experienced discrimination or maltreatment, but perhaps people are more considerate and open-minded now because of the massive information that we can access regarding this.If you're not into reading sad novels, then you should skip this one. However, don't fail to read this if you can handle distressing stories such as this.
