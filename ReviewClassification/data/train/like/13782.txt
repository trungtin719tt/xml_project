I recently came across a review of John Irving's work which claimed that only three of his novels are worth reading: A Prayer for Owen Meany, The Cider House Rules, and The World According to Garp. The Hotel New Hampshire, the reviewer claimed, is pretty good, but too "odd" to be considered great.It is oddity that makes The Hotel New Hampshire worth reading (over and over). I have read The Hotel New Hampshire at least 5 times, and have found that it improves with each reading. True, the characters and the events of the novel are weird and improbable. But the depth and poignant accuracy with which Irving describes his characters' emotions as they live through a series of tragically bizarre events makes every moment feel one-hundred-percent true. Irving's gift is for describing the odd and the everyday with such clarity that the odd feels true and the everyday feels extraordinary. This is nowhere more true than in The Hotel New Hampshire. Even after multiple readings, I walk away from this novel dazed, convinced that the Berrys are people that I actually knew once upon a time. This book cannot be written off as too "odd" to read, for the Berrys feel true.The Hotel New Hampshire must be read - if for no other reason than to encounter the single greatest family motto ever: "Keep passing the open windows." Who knew you could put a positive spin on "Don't Jump!"?
