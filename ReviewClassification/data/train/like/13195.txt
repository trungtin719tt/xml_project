The second wonderful, paranormal, romantic book in the series!Chloe's on the run and fighting to stay free and alive... along with Derek, Tori and Simon. And they aren't the best group when I comes to working together. Romance is drifting in the wind with the Edison group, and both things are doing their best to ruin the three people trying to stay alive. Loved it!
