***Be warned that this is the 3rd book of a planned 5 book series. So this takes us about halfway through events. It ends on a cliffhanger, but I still loved it!Holy Sh@%! I just finished "Faefever" by Karen Marie Moning and I'm not sure whether I want to kiss her or kill her. Her writing is lucid, smart, fantastic, and yet somehow believable. If you're a fan of Moning's 'Highlander' series and are looking for more of that...then you need to pass on by. If you're looking for a story so gritty, scary, and yet real and addictive...then go RIGHT NOW and pick up all three books in this series. You won't be sorry.Mac is torn in so many different directions in this book, it's almost painful to read. None of the decisions she must make are easy, yet every one will have titanic consequences. She's seemingly being 'courted' by three different males, each of whom wants her for her ability to sense Hallows. In "Faefever, she finds out a little bit more about each of them. There's V'lane, the death-by-sex fae who claims to want 'the Book' for his Queen to keep the walls between the worlds strong. There's the Lord Master, Mac's sister's old lover and ultimately killer, who needs the book to dissolve the walls but will keep Mac and her family safe and restore her dead sister to her with help from 'the Book'. Then there's Jericho Barrons. Every time Mac thinks she has him pegged, she discovers how little she really knows or understands him. Yet her attraction to him is always there. In Faefever, Mac finally spends some time with Christian MacKeltar--a Druid from a pretty impressive family lineage of Druids who battle to protect humanity by preserving the 'Compact' with the Fae Queen.But in the end, it all comes down to Mac. She's the only one alive who can sense the object/s they all want. Her actions affect not just herself and other Sidhe-seers but ultimately all humanity. The real issue is: Who can Mac trust? Or maybe more accurately: Can she trust any of them?I absolutely devoured this book. Didn't eat, didn't take a break (but did have to go to the bathroom once)! Now I'm strung out and strung up. I want to know...need to know what happens next. All I can do is wait for "Dreamfever" which is currently awaiting a release date but will likely be at least 9 months from now :(
