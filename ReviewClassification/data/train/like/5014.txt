4.5 starsCinderella with cyborgs!So I'm pretty late to be jumping on the bandwagon, but this was really good! I know I normally gobble up any retelling, but when this first came out there were so many iffy reviews that I gave it a pass.Stupid.I should have checked it out for myself.So you have a pretty faithfulishretelling going on here. Of course, since it's sci-fi Cinderella, there are going to be some substitutions to the carriage and glass slipper.But they werereallycool substitutions! And you could still definitely tell that this was the Cinderella story.And the ending was soooo good! It seems that Cinderella won't be the only fairytale that gets retold in the Lunar Chronicles...If you've been putting this off because of bad reviews, you may want to reconsider.
