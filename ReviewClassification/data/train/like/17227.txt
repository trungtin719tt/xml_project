And that's what you call a novella.Don't watch,the redheaded mind reader whispered.Poignantly written, Bree is a character that I warmed up to real fast.This book is heartbreaking for the helplessness rendered by the Volturi.Moved and seized me until I got to the end.A worthy addition to the series.Pooja, I am giving this book to you for sure to read. Why? Well, the stories is already known to you but thelyricalway of this all from Bree's point of recital, is spell bounding.5 stars!
