I'm new to Neil Gaiman's literature, having come from a background of mainly Science Fiction and older Fantasy novels. I'm hooked. His writing style is completely engaging, and while I wouldn't quite put him at the level of Dan Simmons or Iain Banks, he's damn close while being a lot more accessible. I'm looking forward to exploring everything else he has written, as he is now one of my "go to" authors. Do yourself a favor and read Stardust.
