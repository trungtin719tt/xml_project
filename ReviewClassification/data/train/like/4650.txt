me: 4 starsson (age 10): 2 starsdaughter (age 5): 2 starsI quite enjoyed this audio book overall, although after having just listened toThe Cay, it felt a bit slow. I enjoyed all the relationships the MC developed with the various animals on the island in the absence of human companionship. My kids did not enjoy it as much and were happy to be done with it.My son said that there was not enough "action" and that there was "too much talk about feelings". He would have given it 1.5 stars, except that he did enjoy a couple of the humorous bits such as when the tame birds would swoop down and steal fur from the dog's back to use in their nests.My daughter said that she didn't like the parts about the father, brother, and dog dying. Understandable.I think we need to switch gears and pick out a book that is not a survival story for our next audio book.
