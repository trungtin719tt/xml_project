A classic in the true crime genre, this is a fascinating account of the Charles Manson family and the murders they committed in the summer of 1969.Written by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi, the reader learns the details as the police detectives do. We watch them investigate the murders, interview witnesses and follow up on leads. Bugliosi also shares his perspective on the case, which was interesting. I listened to this on audio and was riveted throughout.But when it came time to write this review, I couldn't summarize the story. Charles Manson's crimes were so heinous that I was revolted trying to find the words. My apologies, but if you want a recap of his evils, you'll have to look elsewhere.This was my first time reading this book, and I picked it up as preparation for the novelThe Girlsby Emma Cline, which was inspired by the Manson family. However, I was so creeped out by the true story that I might need to wait a bit before I can read the fictional version.Recommended for fans of true crime.
