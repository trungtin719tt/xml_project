This is one of the two books I tend to read at least once a year (the other one is Lolita, by Vladimir Nabokov). I've probably read it at least 25 times and I get something new from it every time. He's one of those writers who makes the English language sound decadent and beautiful.It definitely contains the single best passage about food that I've ever seen - the scene with Charles Ryder and Rex Mottram eating pressed duck and caviar blinis in a little restaurant in London. The way he writes about the caviar, coated in cream and butter, is like pornography, only classy.There's a lot going on in this book. The stilted, repressed love story between Charles and the corrupt, gorgeous, alcoholic Sebastian. Charles, coming from such a grim, ugly family and dull background, stumbling on a different world, so glamorous and beautiful and mysterious, like Avalon, and losing it again, and pining for it for the rest of his repressed, dull British life. Repressed and not-so-repressed homosexuality everywhere you look. The descriptions of the supper parties at Oxford, with Sebastian holding forth and serving plover's eggs to a group of young, sybaritic men. The byronic, queeny Anthony Blanche drinking Brandy Alexanders and shocking the bourgeousie. And the whole book is set on an undercurrent of Catholicism. Julia Flyte, with the pet tortoise Rex gave her as a gift, with her initials set in diamonds into the shell....It's a heartbreaking, beautiful, strangely existential book, and I love it.
