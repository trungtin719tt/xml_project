Wonderful story that I readwaaaytoo late in the game!The Last Unicornis a great quest novel with a driven character in search of the most sympathetic of causes, to find out if she is the last of her kind. It's filled with a bevy of almost Alice-in-Wonderland-interesting side characters...although I could've done without the names, especially Schmendrick, the bumbling wizard. Come on.Honestly, that last point is what holds this back from being a truly great classic in my eyes. Let me explain...I'm not usually a fan of comic-fantasy, a "genre" that was popular during cynical war and post-war times, such as when this was published. I love humor, but turning all the characters into caricatures and/or into the butt of a joke is a mistake. We get it, fantasy is what it is, but don't make fun of it or devalue it to the point of ridicule.I should've readThe Last Unicornas a young teen. The only reason I finally got around to reading this a few years ago was because of my love for the cartoon version, which I saw at a perfectly young age. Although, I remember popping wood over the lovely, long-lashed, doey-eyed unicorn and was even slightly aroused by the busty enchanted tree thing, so maybe I should've been a little younger even. Ah who am I kidding, I was getting boners since the day I was born!SCHWING!
