The first time I read this book I cried. I was 26 years old and found this children's book on the shelf at my friend's house. I opened it and read it and found myself within the pages of the book.You Are Special is the story of wooden people called the Wemmicks. Everyday the Wemmicks would give shiny stars to the Wemmicks that did amazing things and gave black dots to Wemimicks that did things wrong.One particular Wemmick, Punchinello kept getting dots put on him, as he was a little clumsy. One day Punchinello met a Wemmick who had no stars or dots on her, and he becomes friends with her. She takes Punchinello to the woodcarver who tells him how special he is - and is not determined on the stars and dots or how he performs or fails.This story made me realise how much weight I put on other people's opinions of me. I constantly performed for the stars and felt so down when someone gave me a dot. I think most of us do. Sometimes I still find myself performing for the stars and trying to avoid the dots. This book showed me that other people's opinions do not determine how special I am - what God thinks of me does. And He thinks I'm so special just the way I am. I love reading this book to my boys.http://www.princesswarriorlessons.com...
