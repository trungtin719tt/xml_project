This is my new favorite book because within five minutes, a person's reaction will tell me how defensive they are about being considered racist, whether or not they've been accused that minute.This is an excellent way to identify racists, for fun and profit.Seriously, covering it in class has been like, "Fielding Racists 101" and "How to Sound Over-Defensive When Talking About How African People Are Actually More Violent, No Totally" class.One guy actually said there was literally no parallel or point of reference for Okonkwe's behavior in America and that it was literally impossible to understand how he could be so brutal.Which is funny, just really hilarious. Since he basically claimed that America does not have:1.) Domestic Abuse2.) FarmsThis is wonderful news. I will inform all farmers and domestic abuse victims forthwith; their troubles are over.Which is interesting, because the story being set in Africa IMMEDIATELY DIVORCED a person from understanding ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED AT ALL, despite the similarities to what we may experience in America. Hm.Anycase, this book made me think and gave me a much needed different camera angle on literature (especially the Colonially linked kind) and that's all I really asked of it. I guess you could consider me a happy customer, in that respect.P.S. EVERYONE GETS 10 JACKASS POINTS FOR COMPLAINING ABOUT AFRICAN NAMES IN A BOOK INTENDED FOR AFRICAN PEOPLE TO READ HAHAHAHAHAHA
