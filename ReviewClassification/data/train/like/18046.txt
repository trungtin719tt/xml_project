One crazy ride. Oskar is unlike any other character you will ever read about besides maybe Tyrion Lannister maybe. The book is a comic masterpiece, a fanciful rendering of Germany during the war and after. It is part vaudeville, part absurd, part insane and like nearly all great literature impossible to classify. The movie was also unbelievably great. If you want to read one book by this Nobel laureate, I would suggest starting here - you will have a hard time putting in down. I think that it would be a good companion read to Gravity's Rainbow by Pynchon.
