4.5 to 5.0 stars. I am a big fan of The Stand by Stephen King and I thought it was the "standard" in apocalyptic fiction...UNTIL NOW. Swan Song is THE BEST apocalyptic science fiction book I have ever read. At over 950 pages, this book could have been a chore to get through but that was not the case at all. I flew through it and never found my attention wandering or my interest waning. A truly spectacular novel with a superb cast of really good peeople and REALLY BAD PEOPLE!! Highest possible recommendation!!!Winner: Bram Stoker Award for Best Novel (1988)Nominee: World Fantasy Award for best Novel (1988)Nominee: Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel (1988)
