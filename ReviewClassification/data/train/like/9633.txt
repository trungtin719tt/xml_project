Tennessee Williams proclaimsTHE GLASS MENAGERIE"the saddest play I have ever written. It is full of pain. It's painful for me to see it."The dysfunctional family portrayed in this drama brought back memories of Williams' own unhappy life while living in St. Louis. It is a story about a mother deserted by her husband long ago, still living in the youth of her past, who is constantly worried about her grown son's nightlife and job stability as well as her terribly shy and slightly "crippled" daughter's marital prospects as she retreats into a world of her own withfragileglass figurines.When a kind and outgoing gentleman comes to dinner, daughter Laura does surprisingly open up to him, even dances, but disappointment soon takes hold with a pronouncement that brings the sky falling down.While sorrowful and filled with an air of despair, the scene with the "gay deceivers" did bring a smile to my face.
