By far my favorite book ever... I read it again about every 3 years. I've worn out half a dozen copies (and given away as many), and would just about trade my soul for a hardcover version -- just can't afford it. Yes, it's extremely difficult, and it took me a few tries to get going, but the opening description of the river and the Stamper house on the bank had me hooked and I kept coming back. Once I acclimated to the shifting viewpoints I could barely put it down. There is one passage of observations from the family hound's perspective that is beyond description, but perhaps one of the most amazing examples of pure writing.
