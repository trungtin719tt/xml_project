Hope, Knowledge, Continuity. Mankind's need or thirst for these never diminishes.The story starts 600 years after the destruction of Civilization. Mankind is finding it's way (again). Times are dark and hard. Miller adds humour to the stark reality. I laughed at Francis' definition of the Fallout, at the wonderment of the religious transistors and more. Yet this isn't a light story.We follow thousands of years of rebuilding, relearning, reknowing. There are no easy problems or answers here. How would we handle a second chance?The Brothers of the Monastery of Saint Liebowitz have salvage and saved all scraps of knowledge they find after the Fire Deluge that destroyed the world. They spend their lives copying the ancient texts to save them for when the information can be understood again. It's irrelevant that they don't understand. What's important is that this knowledge is not lost.In a world where these scraps of paper are decipherable a shopping list is worthy of reverence and awe. A schematic circuit diagram is worthy of illumination and beautification. It's touching that the past held this awe when the past is what caused the devastation of the monks' today.From this simple, awestruck beginning Civilization rebuilds and reforms. The story continues through this second chance of Mankind. It's told in a subtle, thought-provoking way.
