The pooooolice might be coming up here to give me my what-fors because I done be talking about plot and meaning like as such the author promised me there be none.Woooooo-weeeeeI ain't never had the authorities after me and don't feel like startin none now.So, apoligeezies, fair folk, and ooooh! Lookie there! It's a naked man running! Did you ever see such a thing!?*scrambles out the back side of this review, never to be seen again*
