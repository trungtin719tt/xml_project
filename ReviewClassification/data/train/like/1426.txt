5 stars for another Roald Dahl masterpiece! He adds a way of life, in the form of magic, to his characters. Many have mentioned to me that they read several of his books when they were children. I guess I am just one of those people that missed out reading him when I was younger however, I am extremely happy to discover him now and know that my grandchildren are reading his books also.This story was made into a movie also and I can't wait to see it. I highly recommend reading Roald Dahl if you haven't already experienced this author. Enjoy!
