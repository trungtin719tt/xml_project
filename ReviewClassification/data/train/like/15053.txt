More like a 4.5* rating.This book is fantastic. A well written tale that isn't just for kids, but for adults as well. I still am amazed that some people refuse to read books that are for "kids." I think you are doing yourself a disservice by not branching out to these books that are every bit as fantastic as "adult" books. But I digress and to each his own I suppose.I wasn't sure what to expect when I first started this book. I knew that it was wildly popular and I have come across it on multiple must-read lists. I can see why now. This book was just a lot of fun from start to finish, with a couple of slow spots sprinkled in. But to be fair the slow spots weren't even that slow really, they just felt slow compared to the edge of your seat parts.Bartimaeus was a delight to read. He is a fun, sarcastic, witty character that made me smile multiple times. He is devious, and his footnotes are (most of the time) a pleasure to read. And also they are a neat way to flesh out some of the story/magic system/Bartimeaus' past.Nathaniel is a brilliant 11/12 year old. One of my favorite types of characters. I love the genius type. They are a pleasure to read. It is easy to forget his age sometimes while reading this book. It's a good thing Stroud does a good job of reminding us in his writing.Last thing I wanna say is the magic system is pretty cool. A London that is run by Magicians. But Magicians don't have any real power. All their power comes from some form of spirit, djinni, or other demon from the Other Place. It really is quite unique and I very much enjoyed it.I will definitely be reading the rest of this trilogy. And if the trilogy stays this good then I plan on reading more from Jonathan Stroud. Fun, Fun book.
