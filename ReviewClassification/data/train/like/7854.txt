I adore and highly recommend this Regency-era fantasy but it definitely isn't everyone's cuppa tea! The bad: It's a doorstopper of a novel, very long and slow-paced. The good: It's absolutely brilliant, filled with intricate details, REALLY creative. Give it a shot!Adventures in readingJonathan Strange &amp; Mr Norrellwith my real-life book club (also posted onFantasy Literature):Tadiana:This book is like a mashup of Jane Austen, or maybe Charles Dickens, and fantasy, with Regency-era British magicians and charming, vindictive and devious faeries. It creates an incredibly rich, complex and detailed fantasy world; the Raven King mythology is fantastic. The main plotline of this novel deals with the on-and-off friendship between two very different magicians: Mr Norrell, who is bookish, stuffy and reclusive, and Jonathan Strange, who's a younger, charming and impetuous person, and their dealings and troubles with Faerie and other magical places and characters, but there are several subplots intricately woven into this tale. It thoughtfully explores some interesting issues that you wouldn't expect, like the difficulties women, servants and minorities have had in making their voices heard. This is a truly unique and inventive novel. It challenged my brain and fascinated me. I adored it.Rest of book club:This book is soooo long. Aaand kind of confusing, not to mention slow and boring.Tadiana:I love the dry humor. The tongue-in-cheek quasi-scholarly footnotes totally crack me up.Rest of book club:Seriously, what is the deal with those bizarre footnotes? They're just weird.Tadiana:Imma buy this in hardback and keep it forever.Rest of book club:DNF
