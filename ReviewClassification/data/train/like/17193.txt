Once again, this book has everything Max. Because I originally thought this was the last book in the series, I think I became specially attached to it. Many of my favorite quotes come from this one.There's more pop-culture and "normal" references in Book 3, but they just it make it all the funnier. Can we say Paris, Dallas Cowboy cheerleaders, beach bunnies, LA gangs, and Hollywood sign? :DThis is also the first book to rotate perspective more than the previous two, and for good reason (but I won't say what). I liked it, especially when Fang included the "blog replies".And we get our first serious hints of Fang/Max here! Whoo! Max on Valium remains one of the funniest things I've ever read in my life. Same goes for all conversations that pit Flock against School scientists. "I vill now deestroy de Snickuhs bahrs!" "I'll call you Guy in a White Lab Coat." "I play a mean harmonica." xDPlus, there's the return of Dr. Martinez, Ella, a certain schizo hacker, a troublesome clone, and chocolate chip cookies. What's not to love?
