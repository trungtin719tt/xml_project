I always enjoy rereading James Herriot's memoirs of his experiences as a veterinarian in Yorkshire in the first half of the previous century. His tales of treating farm animals and household pets, and of the human characters he met along the way, are what I have to describe as "heart-warming". They're not saccharine, though, I promise. He's funny, too. Even though I've read his stories multiple times since middle school, I find myself laughing aloud.This book comes second in the standard sequence of Herriot's books (in the US, anyway). Like the others, it is a collection of episodic stories, with some recurring characters - rather like sitting around listening to your uncle telling bunches of stories about when he was younger. Therefore, it's not really important to read the first book,All Creatures Great and Small, before this one.
