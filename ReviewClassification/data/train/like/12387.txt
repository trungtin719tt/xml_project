Aeneis had a rougher time after Troy than Ulysses it seems. He literally goes to hell and back before legendarily founding Rome. His story I read in Latin in high school (Arma virumque cano!) and then later in English translation in high school. Of the great Trojan texts, these was my least favourite and yet I still give it five stars for the realism and beauty of Virgil's text (Latin was rather inflexible and yet Virgil coaxed such gorgeous text out of it) and for the incredible influence this has had on western literature ever since - Dante in particular was so impressed that he chose Virgil as his guide through Inferno and Purgatorio (even if, being a pagan, he ultimately barred him from Paradiso :(Once you have read Iliad and Odyssey, you owe yourself to complete the Trojan aftermath with Aeneid.
