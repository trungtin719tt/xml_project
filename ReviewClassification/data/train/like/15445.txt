The Bhagavad Gita is the most famous part ofThe Mahabharata,India's national epic. It's a dialogue between the warrior Arjuna and the god Krishna. They're standing between two armies; Arjuna has friends and relatives on both sides, and he asks Krishna whether he should fight. Their conversation immediately veers wildly off course, resulting in them talking philosophy for what must be hours right in the middle of a battlefield while all the other soldiers are probably like wtf dude, is this seriously the best time for allegorical fig trees.red rover red roverThe decision comes down to dharma, which (very loosely) means innate duty. "It is the dharma of grass to grow, of birds to fly, and of warriors to fight," explains my introduction. This is basically Aesop'sFarmer and the Viperparable (or the more modern scorpion-and-frog one). It more or less works out if you believe in reincarnation, but I don't and besides I disagree with the concept of warriors, so this is not my jam. Dharma will later be used to justify the caste system:Service to others, the innateAttribute of the class of serfs(18.44)And obviously that isn't going to speak to modern readers. Our ethics evolve but our texts keep saying the same thing, and that's the problem with taking ancient texts too seriously.But that's not to say that I found nothing valuable here. In the discussion of duty, Krishna says:Better to do one's own dutyineptly, than another's well.(III.35)I do my own duty ineptly all the time, so it's great to know that I'm nailing it.And there's a lot of talk about not being too attached to "sense-objects," which meansyour shit,so this is basically a very early argument for theKondo method.And there's this, which is maybe the prettiest description of god I've ever read:This universe is strung on meas pearls are strung upon a thread.(VII.7)I don't believe, but I dig that.It's a pretty poem, and I'll take some of its ideas with me, and I'll leave some of them behind. That works, right?
