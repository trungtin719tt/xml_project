FEELING SO MANY FEELINGS RN.This book was pretty fantastic TBH. I don't that it was quite a 5 star and INCREDIBLE but it was pretty great.Ed was an overall likeable character, though sometimes he said and did some very problematic things, especially in his relationship with girls. But most people in life are problematic in one way or another, so #relatable #reallife.This book was a bit hard for me to get into at first and took some easing in but once I was in I wanted to finish it ALL!The ending was a little weird and abrupt, but kind of fit the book. Ed's conclusions and thoughts were what made the ending rather than the events.It's such a unique story, setting, and overall book that I would definitely recommend it.
