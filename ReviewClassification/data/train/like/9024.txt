3,5 starsBared to You is the first book in the Crossfire Series by Sylvia Day.Inky black hair framed a breathtaking face His bone structure would make a sculptor weep with joy, while a finely etched mouth, a blade of a nose and intensely blue eyes made him savagely gorgeous."Are you alright?"His voice was cultured and smooth, with a rasp that made my stomach flutter. It brought sex to mind. Extraordinary sex. I thought for a moment he might make me orgasm just by talking long enough."Are you sleeping with anyone?"The question was asked so casually it took a second to process what he'd said.I inhaled sharply. "Why is that any business of yours?"He looked at me and I saw what I'd seen the first time we met--- tremendous power and steely control. Both of which had me taking an involuntary step back."Because I want to fuck you Eva. I need to know what's standing in my way, if anything."This book introduces us to Gideon and Eva's world, filled with some interesting secondary characters, set in magical Manhattan.Two very damaged people, both trying to recover from a brutal childhood, who are unable to resist the intense attraction they feel for the very first moment they meet.Their romance is intense, emotional and sexually charged...I felt unsure at times whether I liked this book or not. Yes, there were some things I loved but then there were other things that drove me up the wall....like...is it just me .....but everyone is rich, beautiful, damaged.....are there any normal people in Gideon and Eva's life I wonder?????And then - Gideon!!! Please can you make up your mind.......I want you Eva...no I don't want you Eva!!! Yes, yes, I understand....or am trying to understand why you do those things...but hell, can you try and be normal here and there!!!Okay, I am interested in this series. I did like the story line.
