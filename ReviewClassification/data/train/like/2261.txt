I first read this book in 2008 when I was 14 and it turned out to be the book that sparked my love for literature.I've always loved reading, but before that I only read for the sake of entertainment.Looking for Alaskawas the first book that I thoroughly enjoyed reading, but that simultaneously and more importantly, made me think about greater issues in life for a long time after I had finished reading.Now that I'm 21, I understand that while this remains to be a highly philosophical book, it's not the "deepest" and most perfect book ever. However, it still means the world to me and I'll always be thankful for John Green for writing it.
