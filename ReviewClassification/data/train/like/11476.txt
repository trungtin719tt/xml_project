I'm happy someone thought it was time for a beautiful new version of The Night Before Christmas. This lovely book is the result.You know the rhyme, of course, but it will be the pictures that captivate children, with their close-up zoom-lens photo-like quality, and the gentle contemporary details, like Santa in tennis shoes.
