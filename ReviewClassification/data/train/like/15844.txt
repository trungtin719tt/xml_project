Great prequel to that greatest of novels, Trainspotting. I started reading this one with few expectations, thinking it couldn't be anything else than inferior to its sequel; it wasn't, only different. As Irvine Welsh says, Trainspotting is about "what happened" and Skagboys is about "how it happened". In that vein, the author succeeds admirably. A fascinating story about growing up in the height of Thatcherite society--where there is no society--this is a lesson in Hobbesian anarchy. The characters, as usual with Welsh, are all convincing and well drawn-out. They actually feel real and we get to understand them all, except maybe Begbie, who is out of the spotlight here. Spud, Renton, Sick-Boy and Allison are all quite endearing, surprisingly for Sick-Boy, whom I've always had an aversion to. Kudos for this book, IW--it's shocking, entertaining, enlightening (yes!) and touching. Please read it. It's definitely barry.
