This was the best book in my early elementary years. I remember my first grade teacher, Mrs. Hendrickson, reading it to us over the course of a few weeks in serial form. I read it myself in third grade. And now, out of nostalgia (can you be nostaligic for your 8-10 year-old self?), I'm re-reading it. I remembered it as the adventurous, though sad, life of a young girl. Now it seems less about adventure and much more about the heart-breaking trials of a lonely girl, left alone and for dead.What the hell. Now that I realize this, I'm realizing no contemporary child will ever be allowed to read it. I'm actually shocked that I was not protected from this story... times were different, apparently. Whatever. I'm making my kids read this no matter how hard they cry.
