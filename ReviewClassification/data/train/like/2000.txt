I wonder sometimes if it takes a man of extreme sensitivity to imagine a man with no conscience?There is no room in my heart for indifference, and I struggle to see myself writing about Meursault without at some point bursting out in a stream of invectives. Albert Camus, most elegantly, describes the protagonist's carelessness in his caring prose - a prose of such stylistic perfection that it almost hurts to combine in your mind the beautiful words with their ugly meaning in his classic story. Few people knew humanity as well as Camus did, and few people dared to describe it as honestly and accurately as he did. There is pity in his voice where most people would use their pseudo-Christian self-righteousness to condemn fully and without mercy. There is love for humanity in his account of its most undignified flaw: its lack of emotional connection to its habitat and fellow earth dwellers.The stranger is inside all of us, and it is our human duty to keep him at bay, or to make sure we know him well enough not to let him loose on others. That is the absurdity of Camus' universe, and because it is so absurd, it is soothing in its bleak outlook.
