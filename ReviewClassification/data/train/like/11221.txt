What can I say? This book took me months to read and challenged my thinking on a number of preconceptions I had about the Revolution and the Founders. Instead of "correcting" me and forcing me into a new way of thinking, McCullough gently and deftly inspired me to soak in everything he had to say about Adams and to seek out biographies of other Founders to compare and contrast the men, their ideas and their accounts of history. This book is verbose but in a very engaging and pleasant way. It would seem to the reader that McCullough believes Adams to be the primary hero of our nation's birth and establishment and I suspect that he might be right. I knew little of Adams before reading this text but I have fallen in love with he and Abigail and plan to read their letters as a follow up.I wish that every high school in America would throw away their white washed, pc, editorialist American history textbooks and require all students to read biographies like this. Our passion for America, her heroes and her challenges could only be kindled by such a move.
