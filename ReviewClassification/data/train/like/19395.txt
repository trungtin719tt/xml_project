Reading this book was like meeting with a person about whom you have heard a lot, who has some kind of legendary status, and overall so well-acclaimed that you cannot resist the temptation to meet the person.Another thing you have heard is that the person is so simple, down to earth that he would take the trouble to talk to any layman, to make these biological terms much easier, more comprehensible and comfortable for him. And you think talking to you won't cause him much trouble because you are well aware of some technical biological jargons.So, when Mr. Dawkins finally meets you through his legendaryThe Selfish Gene, you wait eagerly to hear out some more intricate complex terms as the stature of the book and the writer. The chapters in the beginning (2 &amp; 3) bore a bit with their roundabout words. But if you can keep a little bit patience up to Chapter 5, then as the chapters go on you begin to realize why this book is aClassicafter all!I must agree that it's one of the finest books I have read. Chapter 1 is adorable with its nice philosophical leaps. The best chapters areBattle of the GenerationsandBattle of the Sexes. The chapter on memes sounds like the movie Inception. Overall the book is the best reward for its readers.
