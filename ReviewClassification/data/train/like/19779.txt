I can't believe I've kept putting off reading such an amazing book. No wonder my friends have been so caught up with this trilogy.This is Christian fiction. A story about a Jewish Christian slave, Hadassah, and her struggles to live amidst the affluence of the pagan Roman empire, including finding love in Marcus, a Roman citizen bent on his pursuit for wealth and pleasure.I was deeply fascinated by the ancient Roman way of life, most especially the descriptions of gladiators and gladiator fights. And I can't help feeling like Hadassah. I can feel her her pain, her doubts and her fears as she struggles to make her God known to the people she have grown to love and care for.This is a very powerful story of love, deep faith and steadfastness, of courage and of peace.What will happen to Hadassah and Marcus? To Julia and Atretes? To Rome? To the Jews? Can't wait to read Book 2 and 3. I feel so bad not having copies of the sequels.
