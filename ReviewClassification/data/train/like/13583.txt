Captain Jeltz our old not so good friend ( a callous butcher) from the previous book, is after the stolen spaceship with the unlikely name,"Heart of Gold" again! On board are Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect, Trillian and the ex -President of the Galaxy the thief, Zaphod Beeblebrox ( nobody cares about Marvin the annoying robot). The unsmiling captain likes killing, that's what he does best. The fugitive ship is just about to be no more, with the help of the cruel Vogan ( a bad poet too), and his deadly spacecraft's weapons...The Heart of Gold's computer is too busy making the perfect cup of tea, to defend the vessel.Thanks to the thirsty Mr.Dent, a man must have his beverage! The only bright side is that the Englishman gets the best tea, he's ever had...With the crew having only a few moments to live, the great- grandfather of Zaphod's is someways conjured up by Beeblebrox... He can't explain it either. Great -grandpa isn't very happy, observing the stupidity of his great -grandson. Four generations and what a blockhead, it has produced. And an ill timed lecture on his relative's shameful habits, complicates things. But blood is blood and with the desperate, nervous encouragement of the rest of the gang, he sends them in their merry, separate ways. Marvin and the former president, vanishing from the bridge. And the craft travels many light years away, from the rather dangerous somewhat bleak situation. Zaphod materializes on distant Ursa Minor Beta, a planet where it's always a sunny afternoon, along also his not so fun but gloomy robot companion Marvin, and "his" constant bad moods. Arriving in a bar he's amazed, speechless, shocked still the gentleman is no stranger to such an environment and soon feels right at home (after a couple of good drinks). And on this world is the wonderful headquarters of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. Mr.Beeblebrox has an overpowering mysterious urge to see (he doesn't know why?), Mr.Zarniwoop the editor. Yet there are problems, they're always some, the sweet talking elevator won't take them to the 15th floor. Even asks if they wouldn't prefer going in the opposite direction, down. Strange behavior for this machine, some kind of premonition ? The reason becomes apparent soon after an attack from the galaxy's forces, not happy with our former leader's actions. Despite the gallant efforts of Marvin's, they take the whole huge building and transports it to the worst place in the Milky Way, the Frogstar planet. What a dump! A voice tells him to come on down from the 15th floor...He does, very slowly and enters a structure on the dreary surface, will that kill him? Maybe or maybe not... He's hungry, slightly tired and would prefer to be in The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, (Milliways) where they see the end of the universe show ever night ( with a celebrity host ). Reasonable prices too, a great view of the entertainment if you can get a good table and join his friends for a few libations....The only heaven, which our not quite perfect hero knows.
