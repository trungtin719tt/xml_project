Hitting that "I'm finished" button rarely feels so good. I hardly ever let myself take on challenging or long reads like this anymore; and I will admit that at some points during this book I thought, "Why am I doing this?!" But this book has been a hurdle for me for the last 5-6 years and I'm so glad to have finally completed it.The audiobook, narrated by the fabulous Maggie Gyllenhaal, is definitely a big help. I listened to the whole thing, but also utilized the ebook at points to stay focused while listening to her reading it. That isn't something I do for a lot of books, but I found it helpful here.Other than that, I really don't have much to say about the book itself, only because there'sso muchone could say about it. I knew the gist of the story, having seen adaptations of it on screen and read the first 1/4 or so a while back. But a lot of this book is plotless discussions or inner-monologues from characters about aristocracy, government/politics, religion, love, etc. So to sum it up in a review here seems a futile gesture.I really grew to love Levin and Dolly the most of all characters, while Anna was particularly aggravating at times. It's more of a character-driven story, though, so having a balance amongst the characters was helpful to keep the story moving and giving you moments of joy alongside moments of despair.Will I ever read this again? Unlikely. But I'm glad that I've finally read it and can check that off my bookish bucket list.
