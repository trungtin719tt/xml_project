You guys. I had EXTREMELY low expectations for this book and it totally blew me away. I've been avoiding this series for years because I thought it was just gonna be some lame ass, cheesy chick-lit, but MAN. I reeeeaaaaally liked this. Getting the next book from my library tonight because I *NEED* it.
