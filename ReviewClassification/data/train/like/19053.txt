It's possible that Gabriel Garcia Marquez's grocery list is better written than most of what stands on your bookshelves.What Marquez does feels less like writing and more like the conveyance of a mood or a dream that imprints itself on paper as you read, then disappears behind you.It's hard to find fault with him as a writer.This is a particularly fascinating "skinny read," a little book with a lot of bang for your buck.It is highly literary and also incredibly thought-provoking. I highly recommend it, especially for book clubs and advanced classrooms.
