Many years since I've read an Agatha Christie mystery, you tend to forget what a great writer she was. This vintage mystery features the wonderful Hercule Poirot. Loved the exotic location, most of the action takes place on board a boat travelling down the Nile. The mystery component of the novel kept you guessing right up to the end which is always a big plus. Well drawn characters and an engaging plot, time and money well spent.
