It's official...I love Ever and Damen just as much I love Bella and Edward.Seriously, folks...give the Immortals series a chance. You will not be disappointed.***UPDATE***I have since tried to read another installment, and have found there is really no comparison to Bella and Edward. I love B &amp; E far too much and no other characters from other series can hold a candle.
