Of all the King books I've read so far this one was my favorite. Because of my working situation I was only ever able to read this book in 10 to 20 minute intervals and it took me about 3 months. Even with the constant breaks and interruptions I still found this book very engrossing.This book isn't conventionally scary. There are no monsters or creepers (well not really) but I think the villians in this story are much more terrifying because of the recent outbreak of fear-mongering in America. Whats the only thing more terrifying that monsters...Republicans. Just kidding...well not really...but sorta. Its funny that I tend to lean more conservative. I believe in the right to bare arms, capital punishment and small government but if I had to be trapped under a dome with a group of people I hope and pray its liberals.King has crafted himself a gang of the most terrifying villians yet and its because they are actual people. No special powers just regular murderous money grubbing people. I bet I know people who would reduce themselves to the acts of Big Jim if pushed to far. Maybe I'm one of those people.And as usual I am impressed with Kings character development. While not nearly as good as Duma Key or Misery (whose cast of characters were much smaller) I thought King put a lot of thought and care into these characters because in the end there were people that I absolutely hated and people that I absolutely loved. To me character development is the most important component to any story. Bravo King!But really what struck me the most is how fast a civilized group of people can turn into a lynching mob under the right leadership. In the story these people were lied to and very few of them stopped to use common sense or ask questions. How very similiar to recent events. 'Well he's the guy in charge so he must be right'. I'm not sure if King ment for this story to make a political statement but thats how I saw it and it really spoke to me.
