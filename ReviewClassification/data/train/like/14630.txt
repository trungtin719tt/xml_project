Is this book a sequel to the Notebook? Because it makes references to the Notebook, but maybe he's just trying to get your interest piqued so that you want to go and find his other books and read.I loved this book. It was so cute. I want to find rose petals all throughout the house and find a cute dress and high heels. I don't even need to be picked up in the limo. I think a great romantic night planned would be absolutely incredible! I swooned when I read it.While I personally don't agree with renewing of vows, I think in this case they did a good job at it. To keep that big of a secret - pretty awesome. And not only was he trying to show her he had changed, he was also trying to make up for their actual wedding which wasn't at all what she wanted but she sacrificed for him. It was cute.And I'm really glad to say that my parents didn't do that lovey dovey stuff when I was a teenager - or as an adult - cuz I'm fairly certain that would creep me out. . . Just saying.
