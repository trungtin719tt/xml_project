i am actually only on page 425, but i have decided to take an indefinite hiatus from this book.as i have every intention to continue this, but am unsure when that will be, here are my thoughts on the book so far (just as a note for future me): tolstoy is a master character creator. and although he is very skilled at conveying pre-revolution life and society, i have found much more enjoyment in his characters than the plot. that being said, there is a certain complexity in tolstoys method of storytelling. so far, there hasnt been a clear resolution in sight, which has left me eager to see how the story plays out. overall, this has been beyond enjoyable and, because of that, i feel quite comfortable rating this as such and look forward to when i can resume the story.also, as a side note, i am of the strong opinion that leo was absolutely crazy when he chose the title for this.4.5 stars
