If you like a suspenseful, exciting book that you can't put down this book is for you. Remember: it's not what you have it's what you don't have that counts.-KMD, CMZ"This is a great book, if you like books that are mysteries that follow one path and that you feel like you are helping solve, this would be a great book for you. It is just like a game as Sam Westing tries to determine his heir, and who is not worthy to be in the game any longer. You start to feel close to all of the characters during some of the best and most suspenseful moments. I highly recomend reading The Westing Game." -MKSI am currently reading The Westing Game by Ellen Raskin. It is about a game. Samuel Westing has invited 16 heirs to play in his game. The game will see who will win his vast fortune. Sam Westing may be dead but that is not stopping him from playing his last game. So far I am really enjoying this book. It is very suspenseful and most things that come up you would not expect at all. Around every corner is another surprise and I cant wait to solve the mystery. -JNM
