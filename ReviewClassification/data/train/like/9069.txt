This was a deeply moving book that will stay with me for a long time. It falls into the elite category on my bookshelf of "I will read this again and again". I loved Paton's writing style...short, concise sentences and the dialogue written without quotation marks (as well as the social themes in the book) made this very reminiscent of another of my all-time favorites, The Grapes of Wrath. The book looks at themes of equality and social justice in pre-apartheid South Africa from both sides of the race equation...and I found myself understanding and empathizing with characters on both ends of the spectrum. The Zulu pastor, Stephen Kumalo, is a heartbreaking character, and his relationship with Jarvis, the father of the man his son killed, was one of the most touching aspects of the novel. I highly recommend this book for any readers interested in literary fiction. My only regret is that I waited so long to read it.
