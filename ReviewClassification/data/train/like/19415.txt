In much the same way that RJ Palacio's book,Wonderresonated, this book shines a similar light on a child with physical developmental problems: Melody is an eleven-year old girl, suffering from cerebral palsy. Her body is crippled, making it impossible for her to do virtually anything for herself, especially communicate all of the things happening in her much developed brain. She is a mop for facts and ideas, which eventually is discovered when two seminal events occur: first, she and her school aide find a Medi-Talker computer, and then, she is finally introduced into inclusion classes at Spaulding Street Elementary School. Much like August, she has to endure the taunts of classmates, the ignorance of doctors and teachers, and some enormous emotional highs and lows, but she is able to endure and excel with loving support from her parents, baby sister, a neighbor/caregiver (Mrs. Valencia), and her college-aged aide, Catherine.It is no accident that this book has been one of the NY Times bestseller lists for two years. Recommended.
