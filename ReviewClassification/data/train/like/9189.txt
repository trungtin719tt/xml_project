21/7/2016This book is so beautifully written and so full of compelling and complex characters. On reread, I suspect a good part of the reason why the movie version is set in the 1950s is that it's easier to buy a nobleman having that much power over his small town community than it is to accept a priest having that much power over his small town community in the late 1990s.It may also have something to do with the domestic violence that takes place in one subplot of the book and the prejudice towards the itinerant population. Just put a nice, 1950s glow on it, and the audience will say "Oh, that's just how things were back then!" and move on.In short, the book is absolutely incredible, and I love all of these characters. But little niggling problems in the story (such as Vianne's conviction that(view spoiler)[Roux and Josephine are meant to be together(hide spoiler)]prevent me from giving it more than 4 stars.14/1/2014I love this book so much. Like, ridiculous levels of love. It's not QUITE a five star book for reasons that I can't quite put my finger on, but I still think that pretty much everyone ever should read it. It's vastly different to the film of the same name - quite why the film makers decided to take a story set in the late 1990s featuring a feud between Vianne and the local priest and instead set it in the 1950s as a feud between Vianne and the local nobleman/mayor is beyond me - and by "different", I mean "better".The characters are full of life, the setting is marvelous, and every character is hiding a secret of some description. As the story unfolds, the secrets are gradually revealed, adding depth and colour to the characters' lives. I love Harris' writing style, the way she manages to make the mundane seem rich and slightly fantastical.So yeah. Go read it. Just don't expect it to be like the film...
