There's too much to be said about this book.When you cut away any socio-political feelings you may have about it, there's no denying it's sheer importance in the literature world. Not even Shakespeare comes close.As a pragmatic spiritual guide for living, it also can't be topped. So, so much of Western and Eastern culture is based in it's concepts. Love it or hate it, but you're probably a product of it.If you're a believer you probably regard this as a five-star bit of literature. Well, I'm a bit more critical. Even the so-called word of God only deserves four stars in my book. Some parts are a bit dull. Maybe some historians find chronicles of important Jewish family lineages interesting; I don't. That, and there is some conflict amongst passages. It's not a cohesive work; which I think lends the book some dimension of error and simple humanity--both of which can be easily forgiven.If you haven't read this book then you're out of touch. Read it. Either to be a better Christian, better atheist, better human being or better reader. Makes no difference.
