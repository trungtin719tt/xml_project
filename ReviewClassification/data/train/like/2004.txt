The narrator, Meursault, who lives in Algiers in the first half of the 20th century is still the eponymous province of a French department. Insensitive to the world around this Blackfoot without an history has an atypical personality. The events of everyday things of life do not really reach and seem to drag on him like raindrops on the feathers of a bird. Stoic during the funeral of his mother which he refuses to see the body, reconciling with its two neighbors to overcome the primary behaviors, ready to marry his girlfriend Mary as he did not really like, Meursault takes life as she comes. While it is equal, nothing really important.The day on a squashed beach at sun shades Meursault at close range at a young Arab menacing knife, "The stranger" suddenly plunges into the quicksand of absurdity.The irrationality of a behavior always has a way of exacerbating resentment, articulate forcefully avenging arm of the company; and justice to large blinkers to step into the breach, to attune to this nonsense.Undaunted down her cell Meursault remains true to himself: remorse is not part of his emotional. The verdict of this pseudo-justice it adapts to even come to appreciate the world's indifference towards him.It does not come out unscathed from a novel such as this one in which stupidity seems the best shared thing. Some few years after a first reading, I close the still with a feeling of revolt against a world that too often a lack of will or alertness gives way to ease, falling into mediocrity.This novel by Albert Camus under aptly chosen is one of those timeless works whose humanist message lasting impact the collective unconscious.Read "The stranger" it is a step towards the other and that's a lot!
