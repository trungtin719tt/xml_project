I willed myself to read this particular book in double quick time. I won't say what happens in the end, but the ending was dependent on the second half of the book, where we got to know one of the two main characters in the book.There is Jack, and then his mother. Curiously enough, Jack is the narrator, and his POV is unique. He lends strength to his mother, he makes her shine with her patience, her fortitude, and her bravery. I have yet to watch the movie version, but it's no coincidence that the actress playing the role of Ma, Brie Larson, got the oscar for best actress this year.Jack is sometimes gullible sometimes not. Sometimes he expresses curiosity. The latter sentiment is the driving force behind a child's growth. Us adults lose something when we have understood our version of the Room. We are not impressed by a child's sense of wonder. This book, I believe, addresses this case, among many others. Room is a must read.
