This was a terrific read. Every building, every character, every moment of action, was riveting. A colorful wonderfully written look at San Francisco in the 1920s with a fascinating heroine, a load of splendidly drawn supporting characters and a real look at the mysteries of Chinatown. In the center of it all stands a girl who becomes a woman at tremendous cost to everyone, including herself.
