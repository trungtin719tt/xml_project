When I was 11 years old, I used to watch its anime show on a channel, that time I didn't know its name. I was merely interested in the show.But thankfully, I remembered the names of the characters so that when I was in my higher secondary school, I saw this book in school library with the picture of four girls and their Mommy. I suddenly remembered the show.Since that day I wanted to read Little Women.When the librarian said that this book cannot be issued, I wasn't worried. I would to go to library and stare at this book through the glass self.Understanding Jo, Meg, Beth and Amy is an experience in itself.Having read Little Women is so precious a feeling for me, that words fail to explain.I recommend it to anyone who wants to read classics!
