* I received a free copy from Netgalley, so thank you to them*Saint Malo is one of my favourite places in France, it's a joy strolling its historic cobbled streets on a warm sunny day, but the St Malo depicted in this story is as far removed from the one in MY memory as it's possible to get. Set against the backdrop of World War II, France is under German occupation, St Malo under siege, and then finally the city comes under aerial attack. There are parallel lives here in the guise of Marie-Laure, a French blind girl, and Werner, a German boy living in an orphanage with his sister Jutta. It's not just a war story though, it's a coming of age, a childhood interrupted. Marie-Laure flees Paris with her father after the advancement of the German army. They take refuge with Uncle Etienne in St Malo. Werner meanwhile, becomes a radio expert with that same army from which Marie-Laure has fled. This is a captivating storyline, the writing exquisite, it's hard to put down, and even harder to forget. I expected a lot from this book and it didn't let me down. Quite simply, beautiful!
