I really don't know what to say about this book. It was amazing, depressing, horrible and heartbreaking all at the same time. I remember when I read it too. I was at my cousins house in LA, and I was bored, so my aunt when into my cousin's room and found me some books. A Child Called "It" was one of them. I still recall how I sat there in my other cousin's room, completely devoured in it. I was in fourth grade, so I don't think I fully comprehended the severity of what happened to David in the book. I do, however, know that the second I finished it, I promptly started to cry, and would not stop for half an hour. This book shook me to the core, and I remember thinking right afterward, "How could someone DO such a thing?" It seemed surreal to me that a mother could do that to her own son. After that, I wondered, very fleetingly, and then I felt really guilty about it afterward, if my mother would ever do such things. Then I realized that it couldn't be possible, because David's mother had psychological issues that my own mother doesn't. All in all, I have to say that out of all the books I have read, none have been able to get to me more the A Child Called "It".
