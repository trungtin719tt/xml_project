As a German and a lover of German literature, I do make an effort to find the best from elsewhere. This book I would count as one of the best. I now await more from this writer. I have looked and this seems to be the first in a trilogy? I think this is so. The second book is also at heart a search for meaning but is about Hypatia of Alexandria. I say that I champ at the bit.
