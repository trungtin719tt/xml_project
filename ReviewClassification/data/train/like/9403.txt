Read this, what seems forever ago. The days when my babies weren't too old to be read to. Also saw the movie. Usually if I've read a book and saw the movie, which is rare to happen, I highly favor one over the other, however this one runs pretty equal for both. All good memories and a very special story. Now I have to search on demand so I can watch this just before Christmas. The Book was one of the many losses from four years ago (will I ever get over that? Rhetorical), so I no longer have it, but it's totally worth it. Not even a Christmas tree in my house this year (2015) so all the Winter, Christmas books and movies are both making me cry happy and ripping my heart out this year, but I'll continue to live vicariously through them. Torture and happy.Most definitely recommended! A very special read.
