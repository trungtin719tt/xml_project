re-reading this book was tHE BEST DECISION!!I read this book for the first time a couple of years ago and I honestly could barely remember anything that happens... So when the trailer came out and it looked amazing I felt a re-read was needed!This book was so fast paced and I just couldn't put it down!! Nearly every little chapter ends in a cliff hanger so I found myself saying "just one more chapter" at the end of every chapter...The bromance and sass between the gladers in what stood out to me because it's just so great and I feel like the maze runner movie didn't quite grasp it.The twists in the story get my every time and I really don't know how to feel! James Dashner literally keeps you gripped until the very last page where I was wishing for more pages!At times I was actually quite scared when reading this because the cranks really creep me out!! The description and action sequences are really well written, making it easier to follow and understand.I am sO EXCITED for the movie now!! And if any of you are thinking "I might re-read it before the movie comes out" then I recommend you do it because I assure you that you'll not regret it!!
