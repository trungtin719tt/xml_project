The Bean Trees is an oddly entertaining and endearing little book. At first I was not sure I could stomach a book that read like a cross between Garrison Keillor's A Prairie Home Companion and something written by Erma Bombeck but the more I read the more invested I became in this quirky little gem.Under the humour and one liners generated by store names like Jesus Is Lord Used Tires, there are themes of separation and loss and finding a family of choice when circumstances prohibit going home again.I'm glad I didn't give up on this book when it opened with so much silliness. As Kingsolver found her feet in this her first novel, it became quite clear that she has the ability to both enlighten and entertain her readers.Interesting read that may not be everyone's cup of tea. I'll remember 2014 as the year I finally read my first Barbara Kingsolver books.
