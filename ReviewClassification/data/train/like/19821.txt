I really loved this one. This was my third Hardy novel and it's by far one of his best. Horribly tragic of course, well obviously, this is Hardy, but also SO GOOD. I think this one would be a good entry point into Hardy, it has all this major themes and all of his delicious pessimism. Ah, it's so fantastic.
