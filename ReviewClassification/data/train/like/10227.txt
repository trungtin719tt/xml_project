This might be my favorite book of all time. It's certainly one of the first I remember reading as a child, and it's always been an enormous source of comfort. I tried to find the other edition I have (I've got the first edition minus its dust jacket, along with the paperback set of the series), but no luck on here unfortunately. I treasure all of my books, and the Little House/Rocky Ridge series(es) in particular, but this may be the best of them. This is the one where I find myself quoting as I read, because lines have stuck with me for the last twenty-ish years. I read it in one sitting today and was so pleased to find it's lost none of its magic.Now I'm off to eBay to track down Laura's actual autobiography and plan a trip to Missouri and South Dakota. :D
