So I've finished the book and all I can say is: wow!Catching fire has broken my heart with the events that have unfolded and I am desperately holding out for more.As usual, the writing is flawless, the characters beyond fantastic and the plot will leave you on the edge of your seat.This is, hands down, my favourite series... Ever!
