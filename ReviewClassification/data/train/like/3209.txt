Oh. My. God.This was one of the funniest books I have ever read. The writing was phenomenal and I could see myself and others I know in many of the quirky characters.Good and Evil's earthly representatives discover that the time for the Apocalyse has arrived and they're not too happy about it. You see, they've grown to like life on Earth. And besides, Evil (with a capital 'E') itself couldn't possibly do worse things to mankind than what mankind does to itself.And the antichrist's name is Adam, for cryin' out loud! (Not to mention that his trusty sidekick, aptly named "Dog", rather likes being areal dogand doesn't want to go back to being a hellhound; he'd miss the smells!)My favorite line (and it was a tough decision, believe me!):"This is how Newton Pulsifer looked as a man: if he went into a phone booth and changed, he might manage to come out looking like Clark Kent."And don't forget theotherFour Horsemen of the Apocalypse - especially Treading in Dogshit (formerly All Foreigners Especially the French, formerly Things Not Working Properly Even When You've Given Them a Good Thumping, never actually No Alcohol Lager, briefly Embarrassing Personal Problems, formerly known as Skuzz). By the way, he ended up, after an unfortunate accident, calling himself People Covered in Fish.I was a little disappointed with the ending, though. It seemed a little too neat and easy. So that's why it didn't get that fifth star from me.Great book! The friend who suggestedClan of the Cave Bearto me (you know who you are!) has totally redeemed herself with this one.
