This is just a beautiful book. If you love dogs, if you love children, and if you have any appreciation for the power of love (and dogs) in healing hearts and relationships, then this is a book for you. The writing is great and the story is captivating. This is sort of like "Fried Green Tomatoes" meets "The Sandlot" meets "Snoopy." If you don't love it, I'll eat my hat.
