Yes, this book is definitely reminsicent of Practical Magic in plotline. I can't imagine anyone not thinking so...a beautiful old house, two magical sisters whose mother died when they were young, one practical and a homebody, the other a wild woman with a daughter who comes back home to escape an abusive man. Um...sounds familiar. Very.BUTThe author creates an amazing atmosphere, and the basics of the plot may be the same, but the details are entirely new and lovely. The aunt Evanelle is an absolutely fascinating character...not to mention the wonderful apple tree who wants to share in all the experiences. I stayed up late to finish reading this book, and I don't do that often.Practical Magic had undertones of darkness and spices, mystery and tragedy. Garden Spells instead makes magic beautifully mundane...a part of these women's everyday life, and just as difficult but worth dealing with than the marital problems of Emma and her husband.Very highly recommended...the best book I've read in a long time.
