I can't believe I never read this trilogy when I was a child, but at the same time I'm glad I read it as an adult because I wouldn't have appreciated the different themes. However, it must be amazing to get both readings: the one when you're a child and the one when you're an adult. I highly recommend it for readers of all ages, children, teenagers or adults. This is a new favorite. Full review to come.
