This book starts pretty much where the last one left off. Itex is all part of the evil military-industrial complex and has an evil plan. That plan is to kill about half the people on the planet, those not "good enough" and recreate the world. It's up to Max and the flock stop their sinister plan.Like the previous books, the pace is fast and fun. The author gives a couple of nods to Ian Flemming's James Bond, and that's pretty much the way of his villains. They go to great pains to capture the heroes and promise death to them all (the book opens with that order), yet they seem to prefer needlessly involved, complicated, and risky plots to eliminate our heroes. None of which work. In the end, like Bond, this is the villain's undoing. Further, Patterson replaces Erasers with remarkably Terminator-like replacements. Fortunately for our heroes, the "Flyboys", as they are called, aren't as tough as a Model 101 Terminator. They seem more like the flying monkeys from Wizard of Oz.The author develops the characters slowly - very slowly. Max and Fang ALMOST confess feelings to each other. We find out who Max's parents really are, and be prepared for some surprises from Ari.The book ends leaving things wide open for a sequel. There is a great climax and grand battle worthy of any Hollywood action flick. The villain gloats, Max must battle alone, great odds are faced, and the villain is beaten and it's over. Or, is it?All in all this book is my favourite in the series so far, i cant wait fun read the next one...Enjoy the ride ;)
