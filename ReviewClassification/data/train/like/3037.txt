"Unless someone like you cares a whole lot, nothing is going to get better. It's not."I meant to read this book for Earth Day (even though I know I've read it before but I can't remember when), but I forgot, so I read it today instead.In case anyone doesn't know, this is the story of how a being called the Once-ler comes upon a forest of Truffula trees and decides that he wants to cut them down and use the tufts of the trees to make Thneeds and turn a huge profit. It shows the negative side effects to the environment that arise from greed.I haven't read a ton of Dr. Seuss books in my life, even though I've liked all that I have read, but this one is probably my favorite. I think it's crazy that even with however many years that has passed since this book was written, just how relevant it still is. I could go on a rant about all the environmental issues we're facing, but I really feel the above quote sums it up quite well. If we want to keep our environment clean and thriving, we need to care about how the things we do affect it. I think this book is very effective at getting this message across, and I also think it's a great message for kids to learn at a young age.I wasn't totally sure how this would work, using the kindle app on my iPad, since there are illustrations in the book, but I think it actually worked really well! I can't imagine it would be as good on a regular kindle, because I think those are only black and white, but it was very vibrant on my iPad. In particular, with the illustrations, I love that the present is very gloomy, in grey and dark purple, but when the Once-ler is telling his story, the colors are vibrant, and there are so many more colors.I definitely recommend this book to everyone who hasn't read it, and for those who have to reread it because I think it's still incredibly relevant to today's society. Plus it's a children's book, and very short, so it won't take that much time to read.
