I was expecting this to be terribly boring and cliche, but Mead has managed to put a spin on the world of vampires and made it interesting and exciting.The OTP- I was originally going to criticize the power dynamic and give a rant about how it's unbalanced and what not, but having read the rest of the series, I stand corrected!I believe that the best types of relationships are where both persons regard one another as equals, in ability, maturity, psychologically etc. Mead has made this pairing work and they're honestly one of my favorite pairings now.The humour- I love Rose's ability to jump from jokes to seriousness so quickly, it made her a far more rounded out character.For fear of accidentally including a spoiler, I'm just gonna end this off with- The series is definitely worth reading.
