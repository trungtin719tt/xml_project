that day, some people drink their first beer or have their first kiss kissedthat day, some people wreck their car on some road and some of them tear it all to piecesthat day, people lose cherry or goes bananathat day, some people find jesus sitting on their bedroom wall and whispering to them "it's alright, kiddo"that day, some junkies swallow their pain and a bullet down together into their throat, meanwhile, some human flesh stuffed wolves feel joy under the warm bright sunlight with their naked eyes open wide...on that day i see the devil, he tells me that violence has made good friends with lie...i live in china...born and raised
