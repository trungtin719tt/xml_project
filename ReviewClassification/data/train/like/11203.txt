I read this when my children were still small. After all, it was my responsibility to introduce them to fantasy literature...er, ah,....as well as other literature that is...huh, huh,huh.Anyway, this is an enjoyable story, you'll of course run into the character types and plot points elsewhere, but that's okay. Character types, become character "types" for a reason. Alan...Alanna is a good character, though a little, trying or even annoying at times. Still, she knows her mind!This book has a few flaws but none to speak of (as they say). Be sure your "youth" is old enough to read this and has a good reality concept so they can deal with magic abilities, magical training, multiple gods and goddesses and so on. When you think he/she/they are mature enough this is a nice early introduction to fantasy.
