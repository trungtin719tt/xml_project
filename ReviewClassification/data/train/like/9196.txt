Strange story, the main character was VERY dim which did not suit the story.It at first seemed as though it would be a breath taking story started with the age old question. "Are you my mother?" But his repeated asking of this question (To other animals and inanimate objects that could not possibly be his mother.)I found slightly disturbing. It also contributed to my fear that this newly hatched bird, had mental retardation brought on by his fall from the nest.This book also brings up another sad topic, chick abandonment. The process of an adult bird leaving a new born ALONE in the nest for hours at a time a risky and dangerous thing to do to say the least.In short this story is not (despite popular belief) a children's story. There is far too much chick endangerment. Birdy social services should most certainly take a look into this mother's endangerment of her chick.*Note if you took this review seriously...you missed the point*
