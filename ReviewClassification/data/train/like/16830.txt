This is another brilliantly written murder mystery by Agatha Christie. The plot is well structured and calculated with a mind blowing plot twist which will put you quite in a shock. I'm really impressed by the craftsmanship of the author. She has a great ability to lead on the plot without giving any hint or clue to who the guilty party is until the very end; and in this case, it was a shocking discovery.This story too had an interesting set of characters. Here Poirot works alone, without Mr. Hastings; but a new acquaintance helps him in the investigation. And from what I have read of the Poirot series so far, this is where Poirot's brilliancy shines in its height.It was an extremely interesting and intriguing read. I enjoyed it very much.
