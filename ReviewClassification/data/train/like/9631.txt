I really enjoyed reading this one. Im a fan of details and this one had a ton of them, it mentioned the american hostorical background without really mentioning it. But one could see how it is years after civil war and southerns have lost their slaved and their aristocracy. Society is getting industrialized , the way of life has been changed and the binary btw city/urban life is shown by the Toms wish to become a sailor. Everyone should become something, do sth, leisure is no more praised, art is no longer praised and happiness and relief is as fradgile and as unreal as the glass unicorn Laura praises which looses its horn and is given away finally. The magical cinema is here, it fills the escape literatures place as the books werent praised in the house. And how the dream is shattered, how the american dream is shattered for almost all of them, leaving them to live in the nostalgia of good old days. Yet the only one who seems to be living in the present is blamed and cant walk. How sacrifice has become a virtue in order to control the crowds of workers wasting their life in dark places. Tom was fired because he wrote a poem on a shoe box, yeah what a play.
