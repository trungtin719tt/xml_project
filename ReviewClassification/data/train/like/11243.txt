3.5I loved the movie (Matt Damon one), I like the book, but I did not love the book. My biggest complaint is that in this espionage thriller there were a lot of political twists and turns that sometimes bored me or became too hard to fully understand. Another thing is the whole Stockholm syndrome thing that did not work too well for me. It left me asking way too many questions.I love Ludlum's style of writing. He's the kind of writer that explains concepts and action well without being too wordy/preachy. I always wanted to do this to my short stories but I always end up either saying way too much or way too little to paint a realistic scene where characters are interacting in a non-wooden way.I am not sure if I will track down the rest of the novels in this series but I will definitely pick it up if I happen to pass them in my local book store. I did watch all the Bourne movies and I loved all of them, except the last one which was just "meh".
