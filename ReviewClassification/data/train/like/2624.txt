Going into the world of Narnia was like a dream. Exploring the new world and creatures and seeing it all through the eyes of these amazing characters was just the best time. Other than what was probably the biggest plot conveniance I've read since Harry Potter(view spoiler)[ Santa Clause showed up (for the first time in a lifetime), gave all the children swards, and bows, and a horn that can call help whenever needed, then flew off again(hide spoiler)]this book was just amazing.It had such a sweet and well rounded ending that it honestly felt like a standalone. I almost didn't continue to the next one because it was such a satisfying ending but I just want to spend more time with these children and in this world. So, on to the next one!
