Book ReviewCan you believeWinnie-the-PoohbyA.A. Milneis almost 100 years old? I was shocked when I found out... I thought it was from the 1950s or 1960s... nonetheless, it's an amazing memory. So many fun characters, great childhood moment and even some adult ones come from these books and the subsequent mass market media that came from them. It always had me wondering... what exactly is a "pooh," as in bear... Christopher Robin's made-up name, so it seems, came from a childhood bear and the name of a swan. Interesting... I also never knew when I read this years ago that it was from an entire series. I'm sure I read more, but I don't know specifically which ones! I'm sure we've all seen some adaption of this childhood favorite. Kids love animals. Kids love talking animals. Kids love stuffed toys. It's just perfect for them.About MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT. I write A LOT. And now I blog A LOT.
