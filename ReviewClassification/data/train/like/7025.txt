One of the most outstanding, hugely epic sagas ever. There seem to be six distinct writers in "Cloud Atlas"--distinct, original tableaux: their compilation suggesting that the boundaries of writing are endless. Mitchell is authentic in every story. These really are "found objects" placed in blatant, cunning contrast with each other. But that they were all borne from one fountainhead--from one single and chameleonic (probably the most chameleonic I have encountered since Peruvian Mario Vargas Llosa's) mind--this is the reason the novel is now a classic.The movie is a very adequate companion piece, as the myriad loose ends are genuinely brought forth and rendered poetic. Really truly &amp; madly love 'em both!
