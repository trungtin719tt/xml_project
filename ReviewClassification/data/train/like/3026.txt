I have continuously read this book since watching the film bc I believe in its message about saving Mother Earth and the trees. I am not a tree hugger but I love my toilet paper and my paperback books and I believe all our God given gifts should be treasured and saved esp from these greedy, nasty corporations that only care about the money coming in.That being said, I'm not into all the rhyming thneads and so on but the kiddoes love it. They are the target and I hope they come to understand the message, if not the crazy rhymes.
