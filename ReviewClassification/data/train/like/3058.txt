Fantastic emotional roller coaster ride that was as good now as when I read it more than 40 years ago. I haven't read it since then because I remembered it pretty well &amp; knew it came with a TJ (Tear Jerker) rating. There are tears of joy &amp; sorrow, triumphs &amp; defeats - a lot of life in such a few pages. Billy's grit &amp; determination are something for every child to aspire to.In this read, I found the background of the times most interesting. I guess it took place in the 1920's since the Model T was driving around with wagons &amp; raccoon skins jumped in price. The hunting scenes were great. I've only been on a couple of coon hunts &amp; found all the running about more exercise than I liked, but it was nice that Billy enjoyed it so much. His love for the dogs, knowledge of the game, &amp; thrill of the hunt was very well done. There was no hate in it, but a respect in a deadly game.It's just fantastic even though the dogs die at the end. No, that's not a spoiler because there can't be a person on the planet that doesn't know it &amp; it's the reason a few people give it one star. These people must think the world is made of unicorns farting rainbows.I've had a lot of dogs over the years &amp; all but the current crop have died one way or another, some at my hands. Yes, I've shed my share of tears over them, but that's life. It's a hard part, but it makes the good times that much better &amp; this book is one of those classics that makes the point well. It deserves to be arrayed along sideThe Yearling,Black Beauty,Old Yeller, &amp;Sounder. I can't recommend this highly enough.
