It seems The Mayor of Casterbridge can end only in one direction as this Mayor is continually victimized by his own shortcomings. As the novel begins, we witness the famous selling of his wife while he is in a drunken stupor, not caring about anything or anyone else in the world. Years later, he has his chance to make changes, amends but his essential character prevents this. He sees evil and devils where there are none and increases small faults to large. He turns friends to enemies and enemies to people who will do him wrong.I used to think that Hardy was about fate (when I was young) but now I see him as about character. His people earn the good and bad that happens by how they interact with the world around them, by their meanness or their generosity, their straightforwardness or their double-dealing. Fate watches and smiles or cries.A strong 4 stars.3/15/13...Rating changed to 5 stars after wonderful group discussion with Classics section of Constant Reader. This made me realize just how much I enjoyed this book and how well it is written.
