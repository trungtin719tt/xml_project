Wicked Lovely has become my favorite "faerie" tale of all time! I loved this story, it was enchanting, heartfelt, thrilling and absolutely beautiful. Marr's character and story development is exceptional. The way she writes about Keenan and Seth, two characters who are fighting for opposite needs/wants, is skillful. I found myself rooting for both, which is something I don't think I've ever done. I usually pick one character and root for them all the way through. Not the case with Wicked Lovely. It was an emotional journey that I haven't taken for a while now.Aislinn has lived her life by three important rules, including (1) don't stare at invisible faeries, (2) don't speak to invisible faeries, and (3) never, ever attract their attention. These are Aislinn's rules for survival, who is a teenage girl who has always possessed the "sight," which is both a gift and curse. She can see the faeries who hover in the mortal world mingling with humans, sometimes undetected, but most always causing mischief. Keenan is the Summer King faerie and he has spent over nine centuries looking for his balance, or rather Summer Queen. He is determined to make Aislinn his Queen, but Aislinn is tied to her mortal world, mainly the person she loves, Seth. There are dangers and emotional conflicts that cause the characters in this novel to test their will do to what is right for themselves and the people they hold dear, for some it's the humans in their life, for others it's the summer, winter and high court faeries.I loved this story on so many levels. It is one I will read over again. A must read if you think you'd enjoy an enchanting journey of the imagination.
