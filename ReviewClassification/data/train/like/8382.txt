Purchased anew, and laid it beside her bed,Conflicting thoughts flying through her head.Afraid almost to crack the covers, read the pages,What if it was the last book? "No, More," she rages.What if it wasn't? How long the wait next time?Five years? Seven? Thirteen? Unlucky, even in rhyme.First I must reread all the others...refresh my brain of Snow and all his Brothers.Sansa is no smarter than I did recall.Starks should avoid other Kings Halls.Weddings never make things merry,The price too high for use of ferry.Mouse, wolf, frog, fish, crowDragon fire will lay them low.l
