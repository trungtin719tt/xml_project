I flew through this book in less than 24 hours, taking me out of my pitiful reading slump!Even though I enjoyed reading this book, it was frustrating at times. I found myself annoyed at how America was acting and how her relationships with Maxon and Aspen played out. I felt like we were stuck in a cycle of America's erratic behavior and overcritical thoughts towards Maxon. Also, I am seriously wondering why Aspen is still there because I don't see any passion between them like I do with Maxon. I liked how we got to see more of the world outside of the castle and how the society was formed and hope that we get to see more later. Overall, I enjoyed The Selection more than the sequel but still look forward to the next book to see how it all plays out.
