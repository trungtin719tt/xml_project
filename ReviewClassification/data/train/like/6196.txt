"Christian, you are the state lottery, the cure for cancer, and the three wishes from Aladdin's lamp all rolled into one"To:Ms. E. L JamesCC:Christian GreySubject:A Review for Fifty Shades DarkerDate:22nd February, 2012, 12.23From:Jessica co Blogger at Book Passion for LifeDear Ms. James,I'm going to keep this short. This was a fantastic end to a fantastic trilogy, and to be honest, I'm sad that it ended. I'm sad that they'll be no more Christian Grey. This series has truly been wonderful to read, I'll forever keep these books as some of the best reads of all time.Everything about Fifty Shades Freed was beautifully written, and written well continuing the story of Christian and Ana. Continuing their journey, discovering their feelings, discovering their demons, learning to accept one another, they both truly came together in this one.You, Ms. James, have created a wonderful trilogy that should be adored and wanted all over the world. As I said in my last review for Darker these books should be read and recommended. The ending was truly perfect, and the epilogue was beautiful, if not, a little longer than needed. None the less. The ending was perfect and I will forever love this series, and Christian Grey, who is by far the hardest man to forget about. It seems all men now become inadequate.I thank you once again, Ms. James.Beguiled Fifty Shades reader Jessica co Blogger at Book Passion for Life
