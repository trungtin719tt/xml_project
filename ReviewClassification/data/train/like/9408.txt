This is on the coffee table in my therapy office. In my work with children, I frequently have parents read to their children books that will enhance self-esteem. This is one that does it through a spiritual message, emphasizing that we are special because of how our Maker sees us, rather than because of self-generated esteem or the esteem of others. In fact, it suggests that greater self-esteem comes when we let neither the criticisms nor the compliments of others stick, and instead look to our creator for our perspective on our worth. In my personal philosophy, I deemphasize the notion of "self-esteem" and instead prefer what I call "Christ-esteem"--having a sense of self-worth that is based on how the Savior sees us. I appreciate Lucado's story for teaching this message.
