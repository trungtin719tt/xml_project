I wondered if this book would hold up to how much I loved it as a fifteen to twenty-two-year-old when I was frequently rereading it. This is one of those rare books that seems to grow with you and always have new things to discover.The heart of this book is about God's love for us and how it is reflected in his people. With realistic characters with different motivations and approaches, you can see so many different aspects. I could write a very long post just about the different kinds of love.This is not an easy book to read; there is death, hard questions asked, and some very uncomfortable topics. They are the reason that this is a powerful book.I'll be rereading this book. It still is at the very top of my favorite fiction books of all time list.
