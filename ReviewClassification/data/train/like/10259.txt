"It cannot be an ill fortune to have loved a unicorn," he said. "Surely it must be the dearest luck of all, though the hardest earned.""As for her, she is a story with no ending, happy or sad. She can never belong to anything mortal enough to want her."What a weenie am I! I actually got all misty eyed near the end of this book. Really a sweet story filled with colorfully drawn characters and writing that engages all six of your senses.I don't know why I never found this book when I was a youngster. I was really into unis, and even had a beautiful stuffed one with a golden horn.The last chapter has the most beautiful writing in the book, as everything is brought to a conclusion. But I LOVED the scene in Chapter 5 (page 54 in my copy) where they changed the password. Hilarious! It would have made an excellent Monty Python skit.
