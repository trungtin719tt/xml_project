Not sure how one can sum up something so wonderful as this. It was one of my favorite cartoons growing up, even though I didn't end up reading most of it back then, I'm glad I got the chance to catch up now. I have the paperback boxed set, and didn't really start reading them until this year, reading them a little every day. I was sad to see it come to an end, but it was a very fitting end. And, as someone else here mentioned, Bill knew to quit while he was ahead, which is something I appreciate. There was nothing I didn't like about it. Nothing at all. :-D
