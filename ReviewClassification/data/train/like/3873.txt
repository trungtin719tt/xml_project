I've spent years trying to make heads or tails of humanity's need to create religions. I've shaken my head at the childish concepts they come up with to make themselves feel better and a class called "priests" richer and more powerful. I've wondered how people could allow their own minds to be controlled by the minds of, sometimes, lesser men (or women.) This book has been like standing under a waterfall of reason and understanding. Not only is the story an adventure from beginning to end, written magnificently,but it is stuffed with profound ideas. I know, to some, the idea of a book being more than a day at the beach is a turn-off, but this one not only an exciting read about what we think we know (and don't...and neither do most theologians) it has the makings of a classic, a book for the ages. I am proud to include it here. If my internet were so slow, I'd add more books. But at least I got this through. The best.
