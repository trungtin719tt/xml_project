This post modernist take on nocturnal rabbit activity has been widely acclaimed by pundits and neophytes alike. Although the end is itself anticlimactic, the book throughout alternates between a Jeffersonian systematic formulation of an intuitively quixotic plot and a reductive encapsulation of the bed-time ritual that is practically, in its essence, Elizabethan. A revisionist reading unearths the Orwellian presence of the hushing lady, which is countermanded by the ideological shift introduced to the reader by the omnipresent burgeois mouse. Although the rabbit does, in the end, succumb to the hushing lady, the reader is left with a sense of vague dissatisfaction with regards to the character development.
