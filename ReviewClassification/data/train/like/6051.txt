This is in my estimation one of the masterpieces of American fiction. I am surprised to be saying this, because I read it after I'd seen the film, and my expectations were not particularly high. Cold Mountain is the Odyssey retold in many respects not the least of which is its depiction of the horrors of violent expeditions far from home and the yet worse horrors of violence at home. It is a story of the Civil War as it affected those who were marginal to the state and had least to gain from the war, the hard-scrabble farmers of the Blue Ridge Mountains. The assessments of war as benefiting only the wealthy and as a virus carrying violence into every pore of the social world are powerful ones. A beautifully written work of fiction, in everything from the finely honed descriptions of the topography and botany and zoology of the Blue Ridge Mountains to the lovingly detailed descriptions of the preparation of Appalachian food to the brilliant evocations of loss and loneliness and resilience of those caught up directly in the violence of war as well as those who wait for them to come home.
