Lover Revealed was a decent book. It doesn't have the intensity Lover Awakened had, but afterall: Butch isn't Zsadist.Don't get me wrong: I love Butch. And I liked Marissa. And I luuuved Butch and V. Actually I was wishing for a Marissa/Butch/Vishous menage but alas :(Still: enjoyed it. A lot. 4 stars.
