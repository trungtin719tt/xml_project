Man, I really hope no one ever tries to make me choose my favorite King-book, because I would never be able to make a decision. Every time I read one of his books, I'm absolutely blown away by the amazing writing style and by how fast the (sometimesmassiveamount of) pages fly by.Even though this story was (once again) told in great detail, I never felt like scenes were unnecessarily drawn out. I thought the plot progressed at an appropriate speed with a fitting development. I would say that the story in general had many realistic aspects. The concept of a dome suddenly appearing over a town might sound outlandish and far-fetched, but the execution was done in a very believable way. The characters behaved in completely normal and humane ways (both good and bad, calm and agitated).At first I was quite intimidated by the big number of different characters. I got to know them pretty well rather fast though, as they were all described in good and memorable ways. They all had several facades to them, which made them very authentic and (some more than others) lovable. I'm sure that you would find all these types of people in a real town. Stephen King just knows how many different character traits there are in the world and he never fails to include many of them. This helps immensely to paint a picture of a town and all the different people that live in it.He also knows how to write out of the perspective of all those different kind of people. It doesn't matter if we see the viewpoint of a man or a woman, a child or a senior, an established wealthy person or a messy alcoholic, or even (in some instances) a dog. He manages to hit the nail on the head with every single perspective.Sometimes, the story was suddenly told by an outside-narrator and a different tense. I often find these sudden changes in the middle of a story confusing and rather annoying, but (of course) King knows how to do it in the right way and use it to his advantage. He only uses this "tactic" sparsely, which is what makes the story feel even more intense once past tense changes into present tense. It really helps to deliver the point the story is trying to make.Lastly, I also would like to show my appreciation for the little ordinary things included throughout the book. Despite all the drama and all the things that happen, there is still time found for a mum wanting her son to clean his room, kids playing games and so on. This adds another layer of realism, which makes me love this book even more.
