A Must Read For WW2 JunkiesThanks to Steve Snyder for sharing his Dad's story.I ripped through this very well written book and left it with further admiration for the young men who dealt with fear on a daily basis, what amazing heroes they were.My Dad was on an LST during the same period but unfortunately he never talked about his experiences, many of these kids never did so I appreciate the research here.
