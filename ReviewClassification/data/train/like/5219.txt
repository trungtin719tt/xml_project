Literary rapture. I don't know how else I could describe my first experience readingLeaves of Grass. It was pure literary rapture.I highly recommendLeaves of Grassto everyone - especially those who still believe, or want to believe, in the basic goodness of the American Experiment.Pick up the slim first edition (Whitman revised and expandedLeaves of Grassthroughout his life. The final product, which is what is most often seen on bookshelves, is a bloated, redundant beast.Read the whole thing, introduction included, preferably in one sitting. It will change you.
