This may be more of a 3.5, but I'll keep it at a 4 for now. I was not expecting to like this book as much as I did (though everyone told me how addicting it was). It's definitely a book that is hard to put down. It's not necessarily the best writing (though I LOVED the world and world building) and I pretty much want to punch every character in the face all the time (and I'm assuming I will want to do that more throughout the next two books) but I still really enjoyed myself. Sometimes you just gotta read those books where you yell at the characters because they are SO DUMB but you love them anyway.Overall a really enjoyable fast read that I would recommend if you are looking for something light and not too serious - if you're in a reading slump this may help!
