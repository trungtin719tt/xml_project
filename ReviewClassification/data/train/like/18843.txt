Need is a fun paranormal fantasy. Each chapter name was a certain phobia, since the main character Zara "collects" phobias. I thought most of the phobias were pretty interesting, but some were just stupid. Zara is a very likable character and a pretty smart girl.The secondary characters shine in Need, particularly Zara's friends. Her quirky band of outsider pals share banter that is hilarious, breaking up intense moments of darkness and angst. Issie is an awesome friend to Zara. Nick is the mysterious hottie that Zara can't keep her eyes off of. I felt that Nick laid on the machismo a little too much at times, but other than that, he was attractive and generally a good person. I've seen a few other people complain about the dialog in this book , and to a degree I can agree that some of it feels totally unrealistic, but somehow the characters still feel very real so that didn't bother me too much.As far as the romance I love the excitement that comes from Zara's draw to the "bad boy". I enjoy knowing what her mind is telling her in contrast to what her heart is longing for. She knows something is different and strange about him but cannot pull herself away from the feelings he brings her.The plot flows smoothly and quickly, while having just the right amount of suspense and twists.I thought this book was genuinely unique and recommend it to all paranormal and fantasy fans. I was surprised how much I liked this book.
