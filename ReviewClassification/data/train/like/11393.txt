The Zombie Room is fast paced and Ronald's style is engaging. The characters are diverse and effort was obviously expended to make their actions consistent with their background as established in the early pages.That said, the characters remain a somewhat cardboard - though it is a high quality of cardboard.The plot really breaks no new ground in the genre, but I knew that going on so I was not disappointed. I did find the end somewhat unsatisfying. If this is the first part of a multi-part saga then there is time to fix that. I would read a second part to see the story come to a more fulfilling conclusion. And I would like to see more of these characters, especially Decker.If you are not expecting a Bosch, Reacher or John Rain you will have a good time with this book. But if pulp fiction is a turn off, you might want to look elsewhere.
