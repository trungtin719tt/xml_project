Inevitably I was reading this against the movie, and I'm here to say that I think the movie and the book are both brilliant. So ha!I love the movie. It's absolutely wonderful. And I loved the book. .. But they are quite different. The novel definitely feels moreadult. Not because it has "adult themes" just in the overall tone and language. The movie is definitely more "family friendly." The movie is wittier and funnier and sillier and faster paced, and the book is slower and more whimsical and felt more grounded in reality (even though it's surrounded in magic.)
