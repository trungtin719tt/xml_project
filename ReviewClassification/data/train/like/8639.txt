I don't know how she manages to fit so much into one novel. I love exploring this world with Claire and Jamie. There are so many twists and so many things to look forward to in the next five books. I'm just genuinely enjoying the journey these books are taking me on. I wholeheartedly recommend picking up Outlander and continuing on. With this one, I also suggest pushing through the first 250 pages or so, if they seem a little slow. It's all worth it in the end and it all fits together so nicely.
