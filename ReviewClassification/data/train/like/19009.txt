Overall, an unusual and eye-opening read. History buffs, particularly individuals interested in WWII pilot training, actual flight bombing / combat narratives, and tribulations of "downed pilots". will find this book fascinating and exceptionally well researched. I rated 4-stars simply because I struggled through some of the dialog, although not repetitious, was very detailed with similar themes. It is amazing what the pilots went through at very young ages, the responsibilities they took on, and how locals risked their lives and their families lives to help and protectdowned pilots".
