LOVE this book. Read it twice because I loved it so much. I am against cheating (who isn't), especially with your best friend's man butttttt this made me cheer for the main character who was having an affair with her best friend's man. How could you not love Rachel? I was able to relate to her when I thought I was going to hate her. This made me tear up and laugh and wish I was friends with Rachel (even with her flaw). I recommend reading this on a rainy night (with a glass of wine or the whole bottle). You won't be able to stop reading it and then won't be able to stop talking about it (like me). Then I will be able to welcome you to the Emily Giffin fan club (this book made me want to read her others).
