Is it long? Yes. Does it sometimes take entire paragraphs or chapters to describe the scope of the landscape? Yes. Is it entirely worth it? Yes. This book is best described as an epic...for those that felt it was too long or boring, have you ever read The Odyssey? The comparison is made for a reason. This is not a book you take to the beach and read on vacation...this is a book you pick up on a rainy day when you call in sick in the middle of the week. This is a book that becomes like a return to an old friend when you reaquaint yourself with it. This is a book that took me close to a year to read as well, because I chose to walk away from it for a month sometimes and return to it when I needed a moment to escape from current times.I never saw myself falling in love with a Civil-War era book about a soldier, and maybe it was the love story or maybe it was because I am from the area in the book that is described with such fervor and passion and affection for the land I grew up in that it brings a bit of nostalgia for my childhood back when I pick it up. In any case, it is a masterpiece. After finishing it, I sighed with bittersweet feelings. Bittersweet because I assumed Frazier had waited so long to write because he had one true novel in him, and his debut would be his only book. Boy was I wrong. I'm now reading Thirteen Moons. I bought it in June and am just short of halfway through. I am cherishing this one, too!Sidenote: If you haven't read the book, I guess the movie is ok. If you have read it, don't bother watching the movie. It will ruin the image in your head. Also, I hate that it was filmed in Europe when the book takes place here.
