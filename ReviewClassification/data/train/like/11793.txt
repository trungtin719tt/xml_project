Just like many, if not most, the movie did NOT do justice to this book. Nicholas Sparks wrote a very detailed, vivid story of Theresa and how she found Garrett through clues in the letters that eventually were found offshore. The difference lies in that the characters described in the book were more human, they were much more flawed, but definitely real. The movie portraied Garrett as a victim of the circumstances that was lied to and that somehow did not have any say in what occurred. It also projected Theresa as someone that was easily thrown into searching for Garrett for the purpose of "knowing what kind of person would right romantic letters," which seems like a lame excuse. I mean, realistically speaking, how many people would go out of their way to seek, find and become intimate with, the author of a romantic letter?One of the most interesting descriptions is that Theresa later finds herself in the same situation she found Garrett in when they first met, and did not understand.... a lesson embeded everyday life.
