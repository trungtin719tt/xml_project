Golding has said that the genesis of his novel lay in the brutalities he witnessed during his service at sea in world war 2 and in his experiences teaching small boys for 13 years. His use of an obvious but effective symbolism throughout the story allows it to work as an allegory of humanity's fallen nature as well as a graphically realistic scenario.
