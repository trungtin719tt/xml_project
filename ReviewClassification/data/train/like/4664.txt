Midnight SunisTwilight,from Edwards perspective.I am one of the rabid fans who couldn't resist reading this partial draft ofMidnight Suneven though Stephenie Meyer would have preferred we not. ***hanging my head in shame****... but not really. I am being totally honest when I say that I loved this partial draft as much, if not more, thanTwilight.When readingTwilight,I often thought Edward was arrogant and insensitive but that is absolutely the furthest thing from the truth - He's actually one of the more tormented YA heroes I've read about. Here is a young 'man' who thought he could never find that deep, passionate love between a man and a woman. He was going through his existence, thinking he was complete in himself, never imagining there could be more. But, enter Bella Swan who, without trying, awakened his 'shut down' heart and gave them both something to live for.InMidnight Sunwe see just how tormented Edward is, how torn between doing what is (in his mind) best for Bella, and what he so desperately wants.... that once in an 'existence' love... that soul mate... that one you just cannot live without.Because, in my mind, understanding Edward is so vital to the storyline,Midnight SunmadeTwilightreally come alive for me.I've since moved away from YA novels and on to more adult themed PNR/Vampire stories, but if Stephenie Meyer ever finishesMidnight Sun, I'll be first in line to buy it.
