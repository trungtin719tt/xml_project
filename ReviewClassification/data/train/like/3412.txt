Splendid, Accessible Prose in Lydia Davis' Translation ofMadame BovaryMost realize that the novel's basic substance or theme: an adulteresssupremeand her poor cuckold hubby. Madame Bovary dreams of literary, romantic adventures with young studs and stands out as possibly the most self-centered anti-heroine in the Western canon. Yet, it could be that some who haven't read it have no idea of the "ending" ending (which I won't give away here).Likely one reason this masterful novel is so affecting is that most of us know that we could have taken a bite of the luscious apple, that if we had made that one wrong turn in life and given in to sensual desire (however fleeting), we too would have carried ourselves and our loved ones hurtling down a road that leads always to tragedy forsomeonein our life.If you haven't read this, I recommend this translation, in which Lydia Davis' prose is sublime, e.g.:Love, she believed, had to come, suddenly, with a great clap of thunder and a lightning flash, a tempest from heaven that falls upon your life, like a devastation, scatters your ideals like leaves and hurls your very soul into the abyss. Little did she know that up on the roof of the house, the rain will form a pool if the gutters are blocked, and there she would have stayed feeling safe inside, until one day she suddenly discovered the crack right down the wall.The novel was ground-breaking in several ways, not the least of which is the well and range of human emotions that ebb and flow through the reader while marveling at Flaubert's astounding attention to detail. Clunky translations of this novel in the past took away from the experience of the sadness, anger, disgust, contempt and pity that this translation so aesthetically accentuates.I highly recommend this translation if you haven't read this.
