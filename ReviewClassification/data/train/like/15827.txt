4.5 stars!I am really surprised by how much I loved this one. I was even prepared to round up to 5 stars, but then I saw that my friends who have read it loved the subsequent books even more, so I decided to leave room for improvement! I read and loved a book by Cynthia Hand a couple of weeks ago, and had many friends tell me that I had to try this series, and I'm so glad I did. I desperately needed a genre switch, and this turned out to be such a fun read."What do you see in a guy like Christian Prescott.?" He asked me that night when he dropped me off from Prom. And what he was really saying then, what would have come through loud and clear if I hadn't been so blind waswhy don't you see me?"Oh, the angst of a teen love triangle! I really click with this author, I feel like she is one of those gifted writers who can really engage you in her characters, and I loved the Wyoming backdrop. Can't wait to find out what happens next.Thanks for reading the series with me Fran! :)
