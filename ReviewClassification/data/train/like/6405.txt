This book had a profound and lasting impact of me. It is a short, exquisitely crafted story narrated by a talented but unconspicuous boy who is jealous of his best friend, Phineas--who is athletic, beautiful, and kind. Phineas stands tall as the prodigy of American prep adolescence. He is simple; he is likeable; he has panache; and he is virtuous. His greatest crime to the narrator, though, is his love. For though the narrator is jealous and resentful that of his authentic golden-boy friend, he cannot even express it because Phineas has always been kind to him. That is an elemental frustration, native to adolescence and loneliness, and no book I have ever read has treated that frustration with more compassion and justice. If novels are supposed to provide beauty and help us understand ourselves, this is perhaps a perfect example; incidentally it is highly entertaining, in the sense of being a fantastic story. Though not as raw or impassioned as "Catcher in the Rye," this book resonates with the same themes and mastery of subject.
