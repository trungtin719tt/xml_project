When I talked to my high school English teacher about my experience reading this, and how it compared to the racy Canterbury Tales, she made an erudite and astute observation, "Human nature doesn't change".This changed the literary landscape of horror writing since. Sexual, sensual, creepy and still terrifying today.This review, published in June 2015, is dedicated to a truly great man, Sir Christopher Lee, who passed away in 2015. Sir Christopher portrayed Dracula in the 1958 filmHorror of Dracula(with Star Wars co-veteran Peter Cushing).Fair winds and following seas.
