The House of the Scorpionis really unlike any YA/middle grade book I've ever read. It's extremely philosophical and thought-provoking, covering topics of the soul, identity, and human rights in a very intriguing way.It takes place in some distant future where there is a land between the U.S. and Mexico that grows poppies for opium. The main character Matt is a clone of the leader of the nation named El Patron. El Patron seems kind and generous, giving his clone an education and privileges that other clones are not usually afforded. But as Matt gets older he begins to learn more about his life and his country's history that conflicts with what he has been told.It's a tale of coming-of-age set against a survival/dystopian storyline with really complex material. I would be wary of giving this book to young readers, as it can be a bit graphic at times and deals with some sensitive issues. But I can imagine reading this book in middle school and having really great discussions surrounding it.Apparently there is a sequel that I was told you don't have to read to get the whole story, but I'm very curious to see what happens next. So I plan on picking that one up eventually.For fans ofThe Chaos Walking Trilogyand other dystopian/sci-fi/survival stories, this is a really great read, and I would recommend it.
