This was mostly confusing as hell. I'm usually a fast reader so I had to take pains to slow down and reread some of the pages to actually get a grip of all the ideas laid there. Needless to say it took me more than a month to finish reading this and even after that I still had to read it a second time just to be sure I understood everything. I love Goethe but I can't deny I had a few choice words for him while reading this book.
