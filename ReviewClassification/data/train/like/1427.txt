The best!!! Thanks to Samra!!!! She brought back great memories....This was a favorite of my daughters when she was around 8 or 9 years old.Some books just make you smile --connect mothers and daughters reading together --make us laugh - and remind us of simple pleasures.This is 'that' type of book!
