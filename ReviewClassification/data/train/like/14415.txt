I really enjoyed this. I read it in 1965 or 1966 when I was 12 and home sick with the flu for a week. Reading this book is a lot of what I did that week. Unfortunately, the two seem to be forever associated. But at the time felt I learned a lot about Michelangelo as an artist, and about how artists learned and worked back then.
