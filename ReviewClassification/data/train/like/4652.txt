Reading a book for a second time, separated by 33 years is a curious thing. I can recall the when and where of my first reading, and the basic plot, but the rest was just echos between the covers. My daughter wanted to read this with me and I'm glad that I re-read an excellent work for young readers and had the opportunity to discuss the book with her. And had I not read this for a second time I might not have learned that this story was based upon a real event; a girl turned woman that was left on an island alone for 18 years in the mid 1800s. Why was that not told to our class when we read this in 1982?
