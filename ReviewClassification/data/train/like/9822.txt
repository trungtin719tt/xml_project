MICHELLE'S REVIEW:RATING : 4 SETH STARS!!This was my first major foray into the world of Faeries. I have read Lament and Ballad by Maggie Stiefvater. This series of books is like mind blowing on the Faerie courts and laws . Wicked Lovely the first book I think is the easiest to read . They are wonderful books but perservere as the laws are detailed sometimes..but once you get the hang of it you are good to go. Each book cover represents the female character. #1 book is Aislinn, #2 Leslie..and so on I shant give it away.Melissa Marr is an incredible writer..very detailed, I felt.Seth..sigh!!!! I was trying to work out if he was a little emo or gothic..but friends think he has a touch of emo but not gothic. You make up your mind. All I know is you will love Seth...he is the tattooed, pierced smexi lad with the blue black hair in Wicked Lovely. P.s. boy can he kiss!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! *fans oneself*You can really 'see' these books as you read them.Some readers wont take to Keenan. I did as he has his court to look after and he needs to do what he needs to do...which of course makes the book exciting. He can be a bit of a spoilt brat..but that just means Melissa is making you really 'feel' the characters.Really worth reading...but if you need to stop and get some bearings..then do it and continue. We helped a friend Carolyn get through them and she enjoyed them.Seth..sigh....sigh
