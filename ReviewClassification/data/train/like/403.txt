ALL ANIMALS ARE EQUAL BUT SOME ARE MORE EQUAL THAN OTHERS !In the start, I thought this book would be from the view point of animals; about how they are treated, how they expect to be treated and how man is cruel towards them.But but but;I am amazed at how Orwell criticizes the political maneuvers and totalitarian rule, using animals to explain what humans do. The author beautifully portrays the way a revolution is started to stop what is happening and going full circle comes to the same point it started from. Just the face of power is changed.This book tells how the ruling class makes fool of the working class, uses their energies and resources for their own pleasure. What happens behind the closed doors of power.How the working class is being brain washed that they are happy and satisfied and free despite of the obvious slavery they have been undergoing.My favorite character was Benjamin (yes, a donkey) , who remains a neutral throughout and says nothing despite understanding everything.A huge applause to Orwell for being able to explain human psyche, political and social dilemma wrapped in the form of this story.
