My second reading and still just 4 stars. Some people give it five stars for the classic that it is, but for me it is a good book, but does not blow me away.I did the audio this time and I highly recommend it. It is read by the author and his forward and afterward are pretty funny.As mentioned a couple of paragraphs above - it is a classic and should be read by all. It may not be some people's cup of tea, but for the time it came out it is unique and has led to almost any survival story that looks at how a group of people react to be referred to as Lord-of-the-Flies-esque.
