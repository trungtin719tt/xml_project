I was able to read a copy of this from Netgalley.com,, wherein you are given free copies of books in exchange for objective reviews. I've read a few books about bomber pilots in WWII, (Wild Blue by Stephen Ambrose, Unbroken by Lauren Hillenbrand) and when I saw that this was written by the pilot's son rather than a historian, I was a little apprehensive. However, the book is extremely well-written. Steve Snyder masterfully weaves world events and what was happening in the war in other places into the story to give it depth and context, making this a great read for those unfamiliar with WWII history as well as those who can't get enough of it.Howard and his crew weren't actually shot down until about halfway through the book, so you get to know the guys on the crew as they train and what their lives were like during bombing runs over Germany. The stress, discomfort, and danger that these young guys experienced is really humbling. When they are shot down, they are either killed immediately, taken prisoner, or hidden by the resistance in Belgium - an extremely dangerous and risky proposition. It was amazing that any of these brave young men made it home at all.This book was very well researched. Personal correspondence between crew members and their families, particularly Howard and his wife, made you feel as though you knew them. The author even found an account of their plane being shot down by one of the German pilots who was responsible. Highly recommended.
