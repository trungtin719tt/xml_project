In hindsight, it seems thatNeuromancerwas a triumph of style over substance, a fact which might go some ways in explaining its enduring relevance as an ur-text of modern (science) fiction: that particular quality serving in meta, perhaps paradoxical fashion by both establishing a trend that was to become progressively more discernible while yet commenting on what was and, more impressively, that which would prevalently come to be. At the time I read this, though, such artsy-fartsy pondering was the furthest thing from my mind, what with the immediate sensation being nothing but enthralling immersion in Gibson's gritty-but-flashy, drug-adrenalized, surgically-enhanced and bodysuit-gladiatorialized vision of a future wherein a considerable part of any shadowy adept's life might be spent within the illimitable confines of virtual existence. Singular touches add suitably to the story:Chiba Cityand its hints of a Japan hyper-refulgent within the muddy tidal bores of the Mississippi Delta; theRazor-Girlbodyguards and their combined essence of sexual aggression and emancipatory predation; the Cold-War limned Russian presence as an impregnable electronic fortress to be breached by neo-American ingenuity; the cerebrally- and sinisterly-limned ICE as an electronic countermeasure software-hybrid and Case's status as a network intruder punitively scarred and barred from doing what he both excels at and requires; and the background hum of home-lab improved and improvised methamphetamines to both fuel the story and abrade it with sandpaper edges. If the whole indeed winds up greater than its component parts, those parts have been highly imitated sinceNeuromancerwas originally published, while the whole is of that singularly-perched transitional perfection that has rarely been realized since, including in subsequent works by Gibson himself.
