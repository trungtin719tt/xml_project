Finding Hope in the Darkness of Grief: Spiritual Insights Expressed Through Art, Poetry and Prose by Diamante Lavendar is a beautiful collection of poetry, art, and prose that addresses many of life's moments. From grief to staying positive, Lavendar has a knack for looking at emotions and making them meaningful. Just about every other page contains beautiful art that calms the mind, and the lyrical poetry inspires you to look inward, shore yourself up and go on. Everyone experiences love and loss, and this multi-layered collection will resonate with many. The author has a way of connecting her personal experiences to anyone who might read this book. You will relate to and understand her pain, while perhaps healing your own. Highly recommend.
