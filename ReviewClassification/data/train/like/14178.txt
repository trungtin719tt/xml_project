I'm not sure that I can adequately put my feelings about this poignantly written epic poem/novel into words. Part of my fears that I cannot do it justice. Simply put, this book embodies the type of literature that I live and breathe for. It's one of those books that vindicates my decision to become an educator and teach this type of literature. It also proves that not all "great" literature looks like a modern novel nor is it written by "dead white guys".Written as a series of concrete poems, Crank chronicles Kristina's/Bree's downward spiral and addiction to crystal meth. Told from Kristina's/Bree's perspective, the poem/novel gives readers insight into the monster and its hold over people, especially impressionable teenagers. Based on Ellen Hopkins' real-life battle with her daughter's addiction, Crank gives a voice to the voicelessness of drug addiction. Instead of opting for a trite memoir, Hopkins beautifully embroils readers in her daughter's struggles. The style is like nothing I've ever encountered before; captivating, deeply unsettling, and harrowing, the tale becomes a part of you by the end.I have a feeling this book will "stick with me" for a while. In fact, I'll be driving right to Barnes &amp; Noble from work to pick up the two sequels. I plan on devouring them as quickly as I did this one.
