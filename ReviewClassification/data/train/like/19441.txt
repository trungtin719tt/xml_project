Though I was way outside of the YA age group when I read this I loved it! If you weren't hooked by the first book ... you will be now!The world was SO well created and the characters jump off the page. It is easy to fall in love or hate with them.Each book got better as you grew to know the characters, there dynamics and the conflicts in their world! Plenty of action and MUCH better done than the movie that followed years later!Three books into the series and I can't wait for more ... Bring on Book 4!
