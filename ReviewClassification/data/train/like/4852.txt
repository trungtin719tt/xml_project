I'm a bit of a history buff and there are some writers who can really deliver. This writer is my latest discovery. The world in which she sets her characters blazes under the sun of the last gasp of Egypt, the characters themselves quiver with conflicted life. I've heard of Hypatia, so much so that she'd become one of my heroes. And I've been frustrated that she isn't as well known as Joan of Arc. But the Church has conspired to bury her, and they've done a pretty good job of it. But if this book were to get out, to get read, a great many women would find the very female they're looking for to hold up as a shining example, to inspire them, to be in awe of and emulate. Hypatia was a real one-off in a time of grinding change and the suppression of everything she valued. And we should value. Men and Women. Freedom of thought, of belief, of questioning, of learning. A genius, a free woman, a beauty. Longfellow paints her portrait as well as anyone could. I treasure this book.
