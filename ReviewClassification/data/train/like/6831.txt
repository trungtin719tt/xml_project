I vividly remember reading this book. I was in 8th grade and I read it in Mrs. Zimmerman's class. She was this bizarre ageless woman who wore her jet-black hair in a crusty bee-hive and had gobs of pastel green eye shadow on her eyelids. She also had a rusty voice-like an ex-smoker, and spoke really slowly. She could have been a character in Martian Chronicles. I still kind of wonder if she was human.Anyway, I read this book over and over. There was something so pristine about the world that Bradbury creates, and also incredibly odd and mysterious. As a writer, he kind of reminds me of Edgar Allen Poe.Another thing about Bradbury, I heard him speak once in college and he said that he wrote this book from the UCLA library (he wasn't a student there), he just liked to hide out in the basement. He was super eccentric. I liked him immediately.
