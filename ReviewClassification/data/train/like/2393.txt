Buzzword A ThonGolden Girls Read A Thon: Read a book under 200 pagesThis is my 5th time reading this book. I can't explain why I love this book so much. I usually hate, Hate, HATE cheesy heartwarming stories like this.And yet The Five People You Meet In Heaven just touches me on an emotional level.Eddie is a grizzled old war veteran and widower, has spent the last 50 years working a job he hates at an amusement park and just feeling like his life has no meaning. Then on his 83rd birthday Eddie dies trying to save a little girl. When he awakens in the afterlife he learns that his earthly life will be explained to him by 5 people who were important to his life.I wonder who my 5 people would be. I wonder how my life has been affected by people I don't even know. I think what I like about this book is the thought that even if we don't know it, our lives matter to other people. There are no meaningless lives.READ THIS BOOK!Its one of my all time favorites!
