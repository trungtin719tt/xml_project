What a beautiful, special book. Jk never ceases to amaze me with her ability to immerse us all into her vast Wizarding World. I truly enjoyed this book so much, as a huge Potterhead myself, I felt the magic in me for this one hour it took me to finish it. Furthermore, Dumbledore's comments added more to the fantasy, to the imagination, they added a background to the five stories that were told. These five stories, so different from our own Muggle fairytales but also so alike, convey lots of important messages. I would totally recommend this book to a Harry Potter, or anyone to be honest, this books is truly a journey.
