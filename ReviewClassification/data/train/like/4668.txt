Can't get enough of Edward's hissy, snarly, growly velvet honey voice? Bella's "selflessness"? The thirst, the infernal burning thirst? Multi/one-dimensional characterizations (Esme's tenderness, Rosalie's vanity, and even dear old Edward--who graduates in this draft from paper to origami but still retains his (delightfully) tiresome diet-Byron shtick)? Wonder what that waitress was really thinking when she delivered those mushroom raviolis?Boy, do I have a book for you.
