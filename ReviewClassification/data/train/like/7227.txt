I was even more impressed withA Streetcar Named Desirewhen I revisited it recently after first reading it about ten years ago. It has a wonderful combination of lyrical language and interesting characters.Blanche DuBois comes to stay at the home of her sister Stella, and her husband Stanley Kowalski in a poor area of New Orleans. Blanche has lost both her job and the family home of Belle Reve. There is a family curse where "our improvident grandfathers and father and uncles and brothers exchanged the land for their epic fornications" and the curse seems to have passed down to Blanche. She is a cultured person living in a fantasy world of lies. She tries to wash away her guilt over the suicide of her husband with long baths, and numbs her mind with alcohol. Living at a time when women were very dependent on men for support, Blanche has come to the end of the road, and will not let men see her in a bright light that will reveal her age as she searches for love.Stanley is a passionate, realistic, common man who enjoys women, bowling, alcohol, and a night of poker with his friends. He is also abusive to Stella when he gets upset. He sees his homelife being destroyed by Blanche, and aims to breaks her by investigating her past.Stella is caught between Blanche and Stanley. She is concerned about her sister's mental state. Blanche compares Stanley to an animal. Blanche says, "Thousands and thousands of years have passed him right by, and there he is--Stanley Kowalski--survivor of the stone age." But Stella was happy with him before Blanche moved in because Stella and Stanley share a great passion. Stella is also pregnant with Stanley's child.As the play moves on, Tennessee Williams does a marvelous job of juxtaposing a fantasy world with reality. The play is violent, sensual, and heartbreaking as it reaches its conclusion.________________________________________Several movies have been made from this play. Marlon Brando starred in a famous version of this drama.The recent Woody Allen movie, "Blue Jasmine," is a contemporary story with themes taken fromA Streetcar Named Desire. Cate Blanchette is a terrific Jasmine.
