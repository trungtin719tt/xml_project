**UPDATE** 6/23/13: WAIT.I'M PROBABLY REALLY LATE ON THIS BUT, DAT IS NOT THE COVER FOR THE BOOK....IS IT?!...IT BETTER NOT BE. IS IT?!?!?!?! Cause it doesn't look very put together O_O IT'S NOT. HAHA. I'M KIDDING MYSELF...haha...*nerve-wracked*UPDATE (2013): HONESTLY PEOPLE. STOP. IT. STOP HATING BEFORE THE BOOK IS EVEN OUT. REALLY. JUST STOP. It's one thing to hate AFTER the release and after you've given it a try, and it's another to hate it before =_= And SO FRIGGIN' WHAT? SHE LIKES WRITING THEM. How are you guys so sure she's only doing it for the money? IF she is, again, SO WHAT. THIS IS HER OCCUPATION. Why do most people do the jobs they do...? TO MAKE A LIVING. AND ALSO. Of course us fans are happily gonna buy them and make her some money because WE WANT TO READ THEM. BECAUSE WE ENJOY IT. It's not like she's forcibly coming into our homes and forcing us to buy or read her books.SO SERIOUSLY. And if you guys think it's rude or lame that I'm "targeting" you then it's rude and lame that you're targeting the author, and some of you, even the fandom. If you really feel like "killing yourself" over how much you're tired of this series. Then go do it somewhere else. I've had enough of this BS. GO ahead and unfriend me block me whatever I don't give a shit. After all, I'm just EXPRESSING MY OPINIONS as you all sweetly put it. I rest my case.Sincerely~Seriously Pissed***(2012): At first, I'm like, What's gonna happen to us when all the shadowhunter themed books are over? And katniss answered that for me...AND THEN I SAW CASSIE WAS MAKING ANOTHER SERIES...And i was likeOMG, YOU'RE KIDDING RIGHT?AND THEN...WAIT...YOU'RE NOT KIDDING????well then....I'm sorry but...I'M DEAD ANYWAY
