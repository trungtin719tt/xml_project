Well, my dears (to acquire Fagin's dirty skin) Oliver Twist was a fascinating tale, about a poor boy and his adventure or progress through hardships, evil people and places, enemies and allies. Some say that this novel has anti-Semitic descriptions but, (although I don't want to defend Dickens, oh no, not that, my dears) I believe that Dickens made Fagin a Jewish caricature intentionally, as a way to criticise his Victorian society. Fagin had something fascinating in his character, he was talking always with a hoarse voice and the way of his talk was seemingly friendly (the catching phrase "my dear(s)", helped to make him look friendly) but he was an arch-villain, and this friendliness in his voice was confusing, in the sense that in one moment you were liking him and in the other you were hating him. Bill Sikes on the other hand reminded me of The Hound (Sandor Glegane), he was harsh, brutal, he had a dog (hound) as a companion, had interests only in crime and food (probably chicken too), and was violent with children (Arya/Oliver,Charlie Bates). Well, to me Oliver was a very flat character, no real progress, he was a sweet yet pathetic boy that was 100% good, almost angelic, and I believe that Fagin was the most developed character in the novel, even though he was a villain. Maybe this novel could be renamedFagin, The Descent Of The Old GentlemanThis was my 3rd novel by Dickens, the first wasA Christmas Caroland the second wasHard Times. I read this along with a very good audiobook read by actor Martin Jarvis very well-known for his narrations of Dickensian novels. The audiobook helped me to enjoy this book even more especially by the fact that the narrator being a voice actor himself was able to make more than a dozen different voices, and Fagin's was the most characteristic, my dears. So 4,4 stars from me. Now I'm off to read something else by Dickens.
