The depth and honesty of this book I think, are often misunderstood as being purely cynical, and depressing. Celine sees the complexities of humanity and gives it to you straight.The truth is an ugly thing to face, but there is beauty here too, not only in the prose, but also in the life lived in these pages. I see some light in his darkness. Don't get me wrong, I don't like people much.
