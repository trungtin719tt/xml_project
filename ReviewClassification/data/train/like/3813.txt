The best book in the series by far. At times it took my breath away. I'm completely content with how the series ended. It put a smile on my face that I don't think is going to be gone very soon. I loved this series and honestly don't think it could have ended on a better note. I loved this book so freakin much!!! Dimitri and Rose were made for each other! I was so scared for them! But they made it through, now they're together, and now my life complete!!! The whole series is just great! I couldn't even breath half of the time! I cannot wait for this spin off series. I am so excited to see whose tragic love story we will all be obsessing over this time.
