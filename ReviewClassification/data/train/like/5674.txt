My reading of this book has a weird story that goes with it. In 1989 my grandmother came to stay with me while my mom was traveling somewhere for a chunk of time. I don't know where or for how long, but that's immaterial. I was a senior in high school and there was this little "women's bookstore" a couple of towns away, meaning I could find lesbian stuff, which was highly sought after by my newly-out pre-internet self. There were other stores on that particular Main Street, so it didn't seem strange that I would be asking my grandmother to drive me there to "do some shopping". After arriving, she went off to some 5 and dime or something while I beelined it for the lesbians. I browsed for quite a while, soaking in all that womyn's energy and looking for something to buy. I already had picked up a couple of magazines and wanted a book, too. I picked up book after book, reading the back and seeing if I might want it. When Fried Green Tomatoes was in my hands...my grandmother walked in to get me. That's the book I bought. Good thing I really, really liked it. I was supremely excited when it was made into a movie. While the movie wasn't as good as the book (at the time; it's now a beloved film) it starred Mary Stuart Masterson which really, really helped me get over that.
