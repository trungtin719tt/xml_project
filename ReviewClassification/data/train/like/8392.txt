Whenever I've heard about other people's favorite books that they reread once a year, I'm puzzled by the fact that they say that they find new things every time when reading. Not every time, is it?In fact whenever I reread a Dance with Dragons, I get lost at the very same place, my most treasured book parts are the self same. I don't read the book to hone any detective skill that might be lying dormant in me, but for pure pleasure.I know the book has problems, but I say that it wouldn't do to follow the same schema as previous books. A Dance with Dragons is officially the fourth best book I've ever read. I can't find the right words to express that hyperbole ( to others). But you know who you are. You who have favorite books and reread them every year. We share the same hobby!
