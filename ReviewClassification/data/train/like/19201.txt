I don't think I've read a better portrayal of a black woman by a white woman than I found in this fast-paced very clever novel. Dido is not the central character but she acts like it. I loved the idea of a cold-hearted good time girl who could sing hot-blooded songs. I loved her honesty and her strength in a time when "colored folk" could sing in the Cotton Club but they couldn't get in the front door. Blacks, whites, Asians, the Irish, the mob...the racial mix in this book is a wonder and I ate it up.
