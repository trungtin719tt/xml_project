this is positively one of the most masterfully simple yet profound novels i have read/heard in years. i listened to the audio version on the way back from my last trip to pittsburgh and, as another reviewer commented, it's a tear jerker. i boo hoo'ed quite a bit and then raced to the nearest borders to reread the parts of the story that moved me the most. this story is a fascinating study of the human condition as witnessed by Enzo, the dog narrator. this will at once seize your emotions and provoke more thought than you could ever have predicted. another reviewer asserted that racing is a metaphor for the lessons we are on this planet to learn. we chose the car (body and life) and even the obstacles (rain, curves, speed) before arriving. this concurs with other authors who believe, in spirit form, we chart a path and body with "masters or guides" prior to life in this plane (see brian weiss, richard webster, and sylvia brown). through Enzo, this author forced an examination of my sense of purpose...and i am better for having read it.
