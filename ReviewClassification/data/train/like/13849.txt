Another of my 'Haven't Read This In 30 Years' titles, the trigger event here is the dramatic story of children who become passengers on the shipExodus. But woven in and around this escapade is the intense story of a people, a dream, a country. We are shown a bit of Jewish history: some chapters will make you feel you are being punched in the gut. We dream the dream ofnext year in Jerusalemalmost as vividly as the characters of the book, who never give up hope. We participate in the creation of a homeland, and feel just as proud of the newly reclaimed farmlands and flowering of the desert as thekibbutzimwho worked so hard. Israel grows before our eyes. We close the book with (hopefully) a better understanding of what 'homeland' means, and how to cherish and protect it.
