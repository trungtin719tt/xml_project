Not going to lie.. this book has been on my radar for a while.. but once I saw that it was becoming a movie... well I jumped on this book quicker than a bottle of wine being uncorked!Artemis Fowlwas such an interesting and enjoyable book. Artemis is basically your best nemesis ever! He's brilliant, evil as fudge, and a ruthless bastard all wrapped into one! Oh, did I forget to mentions he's also en evil millionaire mastermind?!?! He's like the Doctor Evil and the Mini Me all combined into one person! I loved it!Artemis, is bad, but soooooo freaking lovable. Sometimes you need a good villain to love - and boy did I love his character! I loved all of the magic too throughout this book. Maybe I'm on a magic high from theChildren of Blood and Bonebook but this book was such a nice followup!Overall, the book was amazing! I loved Holly, even though she was captured by Artemis.. but damn those fairies can be sneaky af. I can't wait to dive into the second book because I NEED MORE FROM ARTEMIS! I can't accept that the book is over right now!!
