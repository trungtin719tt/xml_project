It took me awhile to drag myself into reading this one. People have always commented that it was so dull and that it was convoluted and hard to follow and I have always believed in evolution and found modern books very accessible on the subject so I thought why bother? Then again I have a thing for classics, and as my list of books on evolution grew I started to chide myself that I still had not even read from Darwin's own hand. So I bent to the grain and pulled it out. This book was nothing like what I expected. Absolutely NOTHING like what I expected.If you read this with an open mind, slowly and take each of his points into consideration you find an absolute flawless logic to his argument. It is well presented and actually I find that compared to many scientific articles it is clearly written for the wider audience. Darwin wants you to get it. He wrote as plainly and carefully as he could. He did not propose his idea half assed or hurriedly. I was floored to find that all of my favorite arguments for evolution came straight from the horses mouth as it were. Darwin got it. He really really got it. He went at it from every angle he could, geological time scales, fossils, birds, plants, animals, interactions, sexual selection, selection on islands, selection in various terrains. He broke it down bit by bit and said: Look guys, I hardly wanted to buy this myself but this is how it is. Just look! See for yourself. Make up your own mind.His methodical manner is hard to shy away from. He did not come up with an idea and let others run with it. He did the research, he talked to people, he took it from all angles and presented it in the clearest manner possible.Yes I have to admit that the writing was a bit dry, but the river of content was overflowing, and the proposal was elegant and clear. What a wonderful contribution. I am honored to have read this work and chide myself yet again for my hesitation.
