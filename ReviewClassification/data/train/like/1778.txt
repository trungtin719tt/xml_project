I'm a somewhatgreenDickens fan (having only readA Christmas Carol), but loved this 150th Anniversary Edition of Great Expectations! As in A Christmas Carol, this tale often portrays an eerie atmosphere with creepy characters.....like the mysterious escaped convict Abel Magwitch who threatens Pip's young life in the graveyard, the jealous andrevengefulOld Orlick with his evil ways, and the embittered anddecayingMrs. Havisham who pines for lost love and leads Pip astray.In this coming-of-age story, the orphaned Pip is brought up by theheavyhand of his ill-tempered older sister and (thankfully) her caring, but poor blacksmith husband Joe (my favorite character), and as Pip becomes a young man, his secret dream to leave his present sphere of life (as Joe's apprentice) and be brought up as a gentleman (winning the hand of the beautiful Estella) seems impossible until a mysterious benefactor makes his dream come true.....or so he thinks.Written with meticulous character detail, this suspenseful, funny and entertaining adventure follows Pip's "educational" and eventful life ultimately leading to thetruesource of his "Great Expectations".
