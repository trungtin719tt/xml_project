In this third installment in the Maximum Ride series everything comes into focus. Max and the flock have abandoned the idea of finding their parents and changed their minds. This time they want to save the world. The mutant wolf men called Erasers have been exterminated and have been replaced with robots. The scientists at the School also want Max and her friends destroyed- for good. Max also has problems of her own like a annoying voice in her head and a micro chip in her arm. The flock splits up and some stay in the US and the others go to Europe to eliminate the Itex corporation that the School is part of. Max will find the truth of her parents and some shocking discoveries are made. Will Max and friends finally destroy the School and Itex for good? I would recommend this book to the fans of Micheal Vey and the Percy Jackson series
