Hypatia lived sixteen centuries ago. This was a woman who should be better known and much better respected than Cleopatra and certainly Nefertiti. She was a genius and a beauty and the last great teacher of what we call Paganism in all that was left of the Great Library of Alexandria. I grabbed this book as soon as I knew the subject, but I would have read it eaqerly anyway since I was changed by Longfellow'sThe Secret Magdalene A Novel...more than a read, an experience. And here she's done it again. I don't know if Longfellow is a great writer (though her writing is beautiful) but I do know she writes of the most important things an artist can tackle. Our deep longing for the personal Divine.
