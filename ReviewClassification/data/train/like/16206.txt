I was searching for a book that doesn't have any magic like in Eragon. So i began searching and came stumbling across this book. Hmm, rnager's apprentice. Catchy title. I began reading it. It was soooo good and exciting! All the emotions and action felt so real when you read it. I couldn't put down the book until either it was done or i was too sllepy to continue reading. SO far what happened was that Will (the main character) gets declined from being a warrior/knight because of his height. SO Halt (his soon-to-be-mentor) took him as his apprentice of his newfound skill: the art of being unseen. Will's friends, Horace, Jenny, George,and Alyss, all got accepted to their own schools. Will began to be trained as a Ranger, while Horace was being trained as a warrior, Jenny was being trained as a cook, George trained as a scriber, and lastly, Alyss was trained as a diplomat. Throughout the training, Will and Horace gon through some adventures together and some were just Will and Halt.I finally finished my book! I love it! i cant wait for to read the next series! Will was so brave to go with Halt and Gilan to hunt down the Kallras. If I was him, i waould be totally freaked out and too scared to move... to even think when i see them. Also Will complete a solo ride back to the castle from where he, Halt and Gilan was to summon help. It takes less than a day, and he insisted to come back, even though he was tired as sh*t. I would sleep all day if i had to do what Will did. Then even more amazing, was that he finished off the last Kallras when he was their only hope. This reminds of how a cornered rat can fight back in amazing strengths. Thats what Will was; a cornered rat. Also, Will was determined to help his mentor and that summoned his strength needed to complete his tasks. That's really impressive!Raw power from the ones you want to protect.
