This was my very first Nicholas Sparks book. I never had time nor made time for reading, other than educational reads for health and career. I decided to choose a book in the airport before boarding the plane. I figured it may keep my mind off of flying- I never in my life thought I would spend the next 3 days unable to put the book down. From that day on I continue to read Nicholas Sparks books. For me I find his books to be captivating, always drawing me in and keeping me there as I continue to be unable to put his books down. I truly enjoy his novels and I now enjoy reading for pleasure. I must admit his books make me cry, but I still love to read them!
