I loved Flow Down Like Silver. I became a big fan of Ki Longfellow years ago when I read her first novel, China Blues. Then I read Chasing Women, which I also thoroughly enjoyed.Then nothing, until the Secret Magdalene, a complete departure in style and content, but it blew my mind. What history, what story, what philosophy, what a Jesus, what an adventure.I was so impressed with The Secret Magdalene, I had to buy her next book, Flow Down Down Like Silver: Hypatia of Alexandria.This is another in her "divine feminine" trilogy, as she calls it. Hypatia is a historical figure, I even saw her picture on a poster of "great women of science" on sale at the Los Angeles Library gift shop. This book tells the story of an amazing woman, at an amazing time in history, when Christianity was struggling to dominate the Western world, and the Christians themselves were at each other's throats, killing each other, killing the Jews, killing pagans, burning books, and destroying history and knowledge.Hypatia stands in the midst of all this madness teaching mathematics and philosophy and trying to remain serenely apart from all the insanity, while at the same time on a quest for spiritual knowledge and understanding. But in the end she cannot escape the madness, it envelopes her, and her world.But that is only part of the story. The cast of characters and the subplots enrich this book so that you get both a history lesson (Longfellow's research is always historically accurate, just look at the selected bibliography at the end of the Secret Magdalene), but also a sweeping story, full of fascinating characters.Another home run by Longfellow as far as I am concerned.
