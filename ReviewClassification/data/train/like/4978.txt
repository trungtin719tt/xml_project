Confession: I had assigned this to 6 of my children to read but had never read it myself. Now I am thinking perhaps it should be read a little later than 7th grade. I am not sure a seventh grader can grasp the glory of it.What a book or maybe I should say what five books!! The Sword in the Stone: Delightful. The Queen of Air and Darkness: Delightfully dreadful. The Ill-Made Knight: Tragically wonderful. The Candle in the Wind: Toweringly beautiful. The Book of Merlin: Ridiculously thoughtful.Arthur, the story of every good man or woman. The earnest quest to build a better world. The ever-increasing chasing after perfection. The ultimate betrayal and the death of a vision. Finally, the rebirth of hope. I have lived that story. T H White has lived it, and probably you have too.This is a full five-star book.
