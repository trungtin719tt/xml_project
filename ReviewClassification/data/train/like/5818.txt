we were asked to read this novel in RPW (Research Paper Writing)module. I had no idea what it was about. However, when I read it I thanked my teacher for her choice and even made it the topic of my RP.This novel is about human beings in the first place. It opens our eyes to how Africans were marginalized in the white man's literature. unlike what we read in The Coral Island and Heart of Darkness and many others, how locals are described as savages and flesh eaters, Achebe's masterpiece lets us inter Umuofia, love and hate Okonkwo and sympathize with Nwoye. feel for the untitled men and grief the decay of Umofia by the arrival of missionaries. regardless the simple style and the mastery of language. One of the most amazing novels one can read.
