This book is very thought provoking and is one of those that makes me wish, in the words of Holden Caulfield, the author was a great friend of mine and I could call him up and talk about it. Shawn Michals is both heroic and flawed, and the situation he finds himself in, leading a revolution, seems extremely topical. Now I can't wait to go back to the beginning of the trilogy and see how the seeds of this trilogy were planted.To Live and Drink in L.A.Here I come!
