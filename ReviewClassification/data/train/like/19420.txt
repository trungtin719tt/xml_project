Out of My Mind by Sharon M. Draper - 5/5 stars.Have you ever felt like an outcast and all you want to be is normal just for a day even if that's what everyone around you tells you that you're better off without being normal?Let me begin with saying that I really enjoyed this book so much! The whole disabled aspect brought light to my eyes for the first time. I've never once had a second thought to someone with a disability and I openly admit that I never believed that they were as intellectually able as the rest of us. Clearly I am wrong! This book was am eye opener for me.The novel follows the story of a eleven-year-old girl named Melody Brooks who has Cerebral Palsy. She can't walk and is wheelchair bound and she can't speak. But do not underestimate her. Melody is a genius. After years of not being accepted and growing up with difficulties, she finally has the chance to attend school. Like a real regular school with kids that function with norm standards. She had to fight her way for such opportunities and her Mom is an incredible woman who fought with her and got her daughter a brilliant opportunity. Melody impresses the norm kids with her intelligence and finally gets to be part of a whiz competition.That's the best I can summarize the plot without giving too much away. The friendships that Melody made were great. The friendship with Mrs. V is my favorite as it shows how much others are willing to go through with you and how patient a human can be. Humanity is coming back into this stone hearted world and I love it.Pick this book up and you'll not be disappointed.
