I don't know why I put this series off so long. Maybe because I am not a huge fan of KoontzI've only read a few of his novels and they were okay. But I kept reading how great his Odd Thomas series is so I decided to give it a shot.Love this character! I love the "I see dead people" concept but even more with Odd's humility. I love that he's a fry cook, I love that he lives in a small town, I love how he surrounds himself with caring and colorful characters.I was riveted from page one and the ending just killed me. Looking forward to continuing the series.
