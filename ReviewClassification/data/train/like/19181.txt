This was an absolute joy to read. I just raced through it. It's funny and fast and sad and colorful and just a heck of great read on a rainy day. Or any day, for that matter. Plus, you get to go behind the scenes in San Francisco's Chinatown back in the Roaring Twenties. The heroine is perfect. You want to shake her or hug her. Sometimes all at once.
