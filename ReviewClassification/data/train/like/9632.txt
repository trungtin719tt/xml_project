4 stars - but somethings are unrateable. Tennessee Williams to me is special. I find his work deeply moving. And while reading a play is moving, seeing it is an entirely different experience. I remember seeing both this play and the movie, and it is unforgettable. I also have the experience, after taking a Tennessee Williams class in college, or maybe it wasn't a class, maybe just somehow it was incorporated in American Dramatic Theater - I remember feeling the compelling need to read or see every single one of his plays. I got a book that was a compilation. And the very last one, the name I cannot even recall, that one I thought to not read, to savor, so I would always have one left. I remember that thinking process so distinctly. But also thinking - if you don't read this now, are you ever truly going to? You might never. What I cannot remember, is the decision I made. If I ever did read it. Or which play it was if I did, or didn't. Funny the things that stick.But - the Glass Menagerie. There's something about it that's so painfully sad and unforgettable. I think it has something to do with how vibrant the characters are, even Laura, in the face of of her delicacy - shines when she interacts with her glass collection, and when faced with her old crush. I truly think Amanda, Tom, and Laura, somehow live with us for an extremely long time. So thankful that I get to revisit these three works of his. Quietly praying there are CEU's involved, although I might not have signed up, and I'm glad that I'm taking the class anyway, it was a sort of impetus and important thing to take care of. I think I'm afraid to truly seek out the answer. But here I am in the month of November, spending some of it with Tennessee.
