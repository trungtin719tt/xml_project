A sense of completion."The fairy tales of the wizarding world for the muggle readers."The tales are what the children of the wizards and witches have grown up reading. I loved the connection this book establishes with the main frame of the story. The tale of three brothers and death no doubt was heard and was fabulous.What made the book immersing was the moral giving stories that fills the young magical mind with the essence of good and bad. The teachings and controversies drawn from the interpretations are no different than the muggle world.Books are banned, content is censored! Humor laden analogy is a JKR signature.My favorite part has to be the message scribbled by Dumbledore himself at the end of every story.The hopping pot instills you with the ideology that you must help others if you can. The message is loud and clear - face the consequences should you go immoral.Laced with emotions and selfless love are the stories of three women who seek redemption.Though,Babbity Rabbitytakes the cake with her wit smacked aura.Verdict: Future schedule - reading this to my children pretending ourselves to be James and Lily Potter.
