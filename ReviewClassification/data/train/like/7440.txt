National Book Award--1993Pulitzer Prize--1994Many of today's "modern writers" have styles so similar, or maybe a better way to say it, their lack of style makes it hard to distinguish their differences. But there are a few out there that have very distinct writing styles that set them apart, that give them a unique and recognizable identity. Annie Proulx is one of those. Margaret Atwood, Dorothy Allison, and Markus Zusak also come to mind for me.I've often wondered about Newfoundland, what it's like, what the people are like, would I enjoy living there. Through Annie Proulx words I feel like I have a sense for what it's like, right or wrong, I don't know. The setting and the characters became real to me while reading The Shipping News. They have their troubles, present and past, in this bleak and often harsh environment, but they are likeable for the most part.The quality of the writing made this an easy and enjoyable read for me. It's certainly deserving of it's awards and acclaim.
