There are no two ways about it, in my mind Jorge Luis Borges is the greatest short story writer to ever live. I have never read any of his longer works, but I have also never read short stories written by anyone else that can hold a candle to Borges' obvious talent with the medium. He can weave the patterns for a momentous revelation in the mind of the reader without them even knowing what her is doing. After reading his better stories you an do nothing but sit and marvel at what has just happened on that page in front of your eyes. He takes a pool of ink in a mans hand and turns it into an allegory about mercy, he creates magical worlds where each small piece reflects something significant and important in our real world. I think I simply lack the ability or talent to explain just how wonderful his stories can be, and so you simply must READ THEM AND THANK ME LATER.
