This novel breaks so many taboos, it is hard to know where to start reflecting on it. And yet, its plot is not unrealistic or uncommon.It is about a sexual relationship between a young man and an older woman.It is about illiteracy and shame.It is about crimes against humanity, committed out of helplessness and an egocentric wish to hide one's own weakness.It is about the Holocaust weighing on the shoulders of post-1945 Germany's population.It is about the past being reshaped in memory when further knowledge about a person adds a new layer to a relationship.It is about the coexistence of complete indifference towards the lives of many human beings and compassion for one specific individual.It is surprisingly not much about hatred, despite the topic.It is about overcoming a disability.It is about facing justice - or not.It is painful to read. And yet hope hides in a corner.If you can't read it yourself, find someone who is willing to read it to you. Or record it on tape. Literacy is a massive achievement and immensely important for human communication.Read it!
