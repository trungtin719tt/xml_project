This fairy-tale like novel about a woman who sets up a chocolate shop in a French village has one of the most beautiful and immersive settings I've read about lately. It's not fast paced but it is certainly enchanting. The setting is the best part but the interaction between characters is almost as good; I think there's more nuance in the characters than some of the reviews pick up on.
