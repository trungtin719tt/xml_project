The plot, characters, and setting are all top-notch, but what makesDruma stellar read is its tone. A reviewer might have described it as 'sardonically irreverant' had notWaiting for Guffmanbeen the source of the phrase. Dripping with arrogance and wit against a macabre backdrop,The Tin Drumfollows our sturdy-at-three-feet protagonist Oskar from his vivid recollections of his own birth through Hitler's occupations of Danzig, DE and Oskar's familial Poland through many other no doubt exciting and bleak adventures that I haven't yet encountered in reading.A tangent on the tone:Oskar's concern for his selfish desires while bullets are firing around him, etc. make me laugh, but also make me remember in different contexts how I reacted to the most horrific events of my own lifetime. I kept a diary in middle school and took great care to document events like the OKC bombing with the utmost reverence and professionalism. But the truth was, the day of the bombing sucked because we had to wait outside in our show choir dresses in the rain because some kid called in a copycat bomb threat to our school the same day. And that's the side of the story thatThe Tin Drumpresents; that's what separates this story from so many others written with similar subject matter and makes this one the diamond in the rough.Quickly, one other observation-or-tangent before I get back to reading (or watching Letterman): I've been reading up on my Greek and Roman gods to get better at crosswords, and just the other day, I read the story of Cupid. Cupid (aka Eros), the god of Love, is depicted as a child, like a tiny cherub. Cupid was a mama's boy (mama = Venus) and never left her side. Venus was worried that her son would never grow, but some wise god or other told her that Cupid would never grow until he himself found love. And until then, Cupid was a mischievous god: he would shoot his arrows at people to make them fall in love, yes, but he would often shoot at people who were mismatched or who didn't want to fall in love. He was never without his arrows and went on, rooted somewhere between love and mischief, until he fell in love with-- oh, I forget who it was. But you can see the parallels! I believe that Grass's Oskar is the story of Cupid told through a series of anecdotes set in WWII Germany. I bet Grass as a young child was obsessed with the story of Cupid and his struggle between right and wrong the way young Oskar is obsessed with reading the contrasting material of Rasputin and Goethe. And in art, Cupid is repeatedly depicted as a young (naked) boy of 3 or 4 with fair skin and shiny golden locks...exactly like Oskar and exactly like the semblance of Jesus upon which Oskar is fixated. I have to believe that Grass-the-author married his own childhood obsession with the mischeivous physically stunted Cupid with a tongue in cheek account of his own wartime experiences and yielded one of the greatest works of the twentieth century. But hey, it's just a theory.
