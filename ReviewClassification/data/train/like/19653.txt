4.5 stars.Imajica is quite rightly viewed as a behemoth of literary fiction. It is a masterly woven tale of life and death and life, much of which revolves around a journey through the various dominions, in search of the truth about the protagonists' reality. At times bloody, and oft inclined towards creating an atmosphere of despair, this can easily be considered Clive Barker's Magnum opus.People often say that, with the writing of Stephen King 'it is all about the journey'. Well, in this instance, it is Clive Barker who has laid out the map, and Imajica really does take the reader down a long and winding road. A lengthy read, certainly. But it is time well spent.
