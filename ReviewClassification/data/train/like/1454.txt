All that is gold does not glitter,Not all those who wander are lost;The old that is strong does not wither,Deep roots are not reached by the frost.From the ashes a fire shall be woken,A light from the shadows shall spring;Renewed shall be blade that was broken,The crownless again shall be king.This book is magnificent, yet utterly enchanting at the same time. It is very dear to my heart &lt;3 I couldn't recommend it enough, it's an amazing novel, though it does have a couple draggy bits, and it isn't my favorite from the trilogy. I still love it though and this reread was epic!!
