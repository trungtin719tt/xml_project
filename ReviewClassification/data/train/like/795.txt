Of Mice and Men is the story of two men, George and Lennie, working toward their dream--essentially to retire by acquiring a farm of their own. The story brilliantly shows how easy it is to make dreams a reality, how obvious it is to have dreams and chase them.But Steinbeck slowly turns things into a nightmare by introducing Curley and his wife. Just by getting in with the wrong crowd at the wrong time and having a few character flaws, Steinbeck shows how dreams are really made of nothing, held together by nothing, and can be torn apart seconds before they become real.Steinbeck might not be known for moving fast, and although this story starts off slow with the signature lengthy landscape description, in only about 30 pages, the twists and turns begin, and once they do, the story reads like a character-driven thriller--with some of the most memorable characters in literature thrown in the mix.The way all of the character flaws combine at just the right time to trigger an epic explosion is reminiscent of The Great Gatsby. And being so short, and how it reads so easy, and how relatable it is to have dreams and have them ripped away for reasons almost uncontrollable, Of Mice and Men is a masterpiece unlike anything else ever written.
