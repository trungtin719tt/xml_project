I would recommend The Cat in the Hat to anybody. Dr. Seuss wrote this book like poetry by having the lines rhyme with each other. The story of the book is don't trust strangers; in this case the cat with the hat. The cat brings a box to children at home while their mother is gone, and the cat ends up causing chaos with thing one an thing two. It can teach children a good lesson on how to be responsible when their parents are not around. The pictures in the book make it very enjoyable to read. I love Dr. Seuss and recommend any of his books to children and adults.
