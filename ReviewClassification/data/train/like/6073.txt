I just love this book. It is a bit on the "unusual" side, but that is just Munsch for ya. I first read this my Freshman year of college. I cried then and I cry when I read it to my girls. It's the intergenerational, unconditional love of mother/son and then father/daughter that I feel a strong connection with. The mother's corniness just adds to the tenderness of the book. I am touched by the mother's love for her son, the son's love for his mom, and then the son's love to his daughter...a breathless tradition passed from one generation to the next. So simple, so beautiful, so profound!!! I was so inspired I made up a tune for the words to "the song" for my girls. My dad used to sing me a Spanish lullaby when I was a little girl that I sing to my girls and I hope that they will sing to their family. Alright...where is my kleenex...Goodness! :-)
