Just finished a re-read of this classic. I remember the first time I read it, the twist at the end knocked my socks off! My second thought was: "Agatha Christie understands evil in a way that is a little frightening!"This time through, I remembered how it turns out (which is not always the case!), and was able to watch the clues with the murderer in mind. An astonishingly masterful piece of work.When it was first published, in 1926, this book caused quite a stir, because no one had ever used this twist before. People were shocked! and some were offended! After you have read the book, you can read about it's reception on the Wikipedia page devoted to it, but there are numerous spoilers, so don't check it out until you are 'in the know':http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Murd...Many consider this novel to be Agatha Christie's best, though I have also heard many votes for "And then there were none" (Originally published as "Ten Little Indians"). My feeling is that Agatha Christie is so good, it won't hurt to read both. My personal preference is for this book, "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd" because I prefer the twist at the end - the surprise is excellent -- over the puzzle to be solved as inTen Little Indians.My other Christie recommendation is the unChristieEndless Night, Christie, 1967https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...And then there were None, Christie, 1939https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...Of course, also good is:Murder on the Orient Express, Christie, 1934https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...And for THE BEST bedtime reading, I recommendThe Complete Short Stories of Miss Marple, Christie, 1984
