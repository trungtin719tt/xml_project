Masterful. Unhurried and understated. Simple, yet deep enough for a young child to appreciate the first layer, while sensing something more... Beautifully done. Highly recommended to anyone looking for a good children's book.I haven't read a children's book this deep in a long time. Every character had inner conflict and multiple layers... enough to keep the interaction new and spontaneous, their character traits growing, the plot diverse and unpredictable.It was a breath of fresh air not to be able to see what was coming next. I was surprised by the simple and understated ending -- yay for subtext in a kids' book! Even though this isn't really a favorite setting or writing style for me, as a fan I wished the author would have written even more between Nat and Kit! Sequel please?!I can see why my dear friend Amy loves this book to pieces. There are true political and cultural undertones, and while they don't overshadow the plot or characters, they're a part of everyday life. Wonderful piece that was moving, yet still realistic.Newbery Medal winner in 1959.
