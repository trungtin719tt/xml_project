Winnie-the-Pooh by A.A. Milne was my favorite book series as a child. Later, when my own kids sat listening to the adventures of Christopher Robin, Pooh Bear, Piglet, and Eeyore, and the gang, it was a little bit of a shock to discover this series, with its charming stories, are not just for kids.A little Consideration, a little Thought for Others, makes all the differenceI enjoyed sharing these stories with my own children, loving the chance - or excuse- to read them all over again, struck by the humor, and the clever rhymes, and diversity of the characters. This ode to childhood and friendship is poignant for the adults, but has brought extreme joy to children for nearly a century- which is a testament to their agelessness.Spying this book at the library, this past week, I couldn't resist checking it out. This time, with my children grown and living their own lives, I have no 'excuse' to read these stories again, but you know what? You don't need a reason or excuse to read these classic, delightful adventures. Winnie the Pooh and his cohorts tug at the hearts of both young and old alike!What better way to spend a cold, dreary day than with Christopher Robin and Winnie the Pooh, being reminded of the many hours of joy they gave you and the great memories they bring back of special times spent reading these books to my own children?Maybe the best thing, though, is seeing these diverse characters stand the test of time, and feeling at peace knowing these special and gentle stories will continue to delight children and their parents for many more generations to come!!5 stars
