I think I would've enjoyed this bookway way WAYmore if these characters weren't fucking15 years old.BecauseNO.I couldn't accept anything because their ages kept slapping me in the face.FOR REAL, this was me :*Cool, intense scene happens*Me: OH SNAPPPPP !!*suddenly remembers their 15 years old*Me: Wait...these little fetuses did this?? NOOOOOOOO*********Romance scene happens*Me: Ouuuuuu......WAIT THERE 15 YEARS OLD OMFG I FEEL LIKE A PEDOPHILE. My sister is 15 like NOOOOOOO.*flips through pages quickly*MY GOODNESS THE CRINGING WAS REALLLLLL !! I hope the next book is set in the future like maybe 5 years later becauseNO.I know, I know. I'm over exaggerating like don't get me wrong, this book was awesome. I just wish the author made them 17 or 18 years old. Would've been more believable, you feel??? And romance scenes between 17 or 18 years old wouldn't freak me out as opposed to a 15 year old romance scenes &gt;.&lt;
