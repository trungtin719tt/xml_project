WHAT A BEAUTIFUL BOOK I AM SO EMOTIONAL RIGHT NOWbasically, this book was an absolute roller coaster ride filled with extreme frustration and a severe case of toying with my emotions, but I am very much pleased with the ending of this book.The writing style and the way that this book was organised and made up completely of letters, emails, instant messages etc was brilliant. I must admit it took a while to get used to but when you do it works so well and makes the story so much more interesting. You really get to dig deep into the main character's emotions and feelings this way and I really enjoyed it. However, at times it did become annoying because it kind of skipped main events and you didn't get to find out much about them (which I would have really liked).Pacing wise, I was hooked and desperately needed to find out what happens with Rosie and Alex!!! If you read this book and you did not want them to be together then we MUST have read a different book because I routed for these two from the very start!I really enjoyed getting to really know the characters and they were all so well developed and portrayed. On the other hand, at times I did feel like the characters all aged too fast but I guess that's symbolic to life because times just goes by so fast!I think this book is leaning towards a definite 4.5 starts, I absolutely loved and devoured it!I am extremely excited to get round to watching the film as I feel like it will work really well!
