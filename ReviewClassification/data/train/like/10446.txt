Absolutely perfect from first page to last. It's been ages since I've thought that about a book.I loved all the characters, as well as the story, which centers around the perspective of witnessing, loyalty, family ties, faith, character and miracles.This book spans a short time period (maybe a half- or three quarters-year) but it's so packed with story and life that it seems to span years.The writing is beautiful, with humour throughout.I highly recommend this book. Loved it.
