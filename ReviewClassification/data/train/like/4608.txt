if there was a better part of my childhood than reading these these comics, i honestly can't think of it.these stretched my brain as a kid. never pandered to his audience. i learned so many words and references from these. i specifically remember looking up transmogrify, kafka and phlegm in my mom's giant dictionary, and later on laughing when i learned about the philosophers calvin and hobbes.reading these is probably a big part of how i ended up being the kind of person who would enjoy a site like this. i was talking to a friend the other night for several hours, and somehow it came up at some point that we shared all the major points of our personality, and we both attributed those aspects to having read these. they make you the kind of person who's not just willing to accept things without questioning them.the way watterson taps into the different sides of his brain to make all these different characters is so obvious and endearing that it's no wonder he never leaves his house these days for fear of being mobbed by adoring fans.i never realized it until much more recently, but these books also taught me that it's possible not to sell out. the story of watterson being approached for huge marketing deals and turning every one of them down is really inspiring. i know personally i'd buy any official calvin and hobbes merchandise i could get my hands on, even now, but the fact that none exists is truly great in its way.please please please read calvin and hobbes. you can borrow my copy.
