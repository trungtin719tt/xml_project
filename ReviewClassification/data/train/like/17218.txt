I actually finished my genre challenge on the very last day!!!! OMFG!!!!!!!Saying this book was insane is understatement.I usually stay far away from True Crime for a reason. It scares the shit out of me. Unlike Horror, where you can distance yourself since you know the story is not real, True Crime forces the reader to face real monsters with no safety net or ejection button.The Manson murders took place back in the late 1960s, during height of the hippy lifestyle. Free love, acceptance, breaking social norms, flower prints, and psychedelic patterns. Also, a shit load of drugs.The Manson Family destroyed my idea of hippies forever. Though the Family was ostracized by the greater hippy community, I still found it hard to separate the two. By the end the novel, my opinion of the hippy subculture became permanently interconnected with this murdering cult. How could a group of individuals who promoted love, spirituality, and peace kill and mutilate random people like they did?Helter Skelterexplains why, but it was not an answer anyone would expect.Helter Skelterbegins with an in-depth analysis of what really happened during the Tate-LaBianca murders. Then steps in Bugliosi; the narrative switches to first person, and the reader is thrown into the heart racing world Bugliosi lived in for nearly 2 full years.I was on the edge of my seat the whole way through, from the initial investigation to the last moments in court when the jury came to an unanimous decision that Manson, Atkins, Krenwinkel, Van Houten, and Watson were guilty. Needless to say, by the end of the book I was burnt out (but not in a bad way).I knew about the Manson Family and the Murders due its pop culture and cult notoriety but other than that I was completely clueless as to what actually happened back in 1969. I think coming in with a blank slate made the experience more powerful. The murders themselves were grotesque and shocking, while the significance of the murders, of the cult, and of the social implications boggled my mind. I, like everyone else, have heard of infamous serial killers and disturbing murders. But never have I come across a case that was so twisted and complex as this one.Bugliosi was the prosecuting attorney facing off against Manson, Atkins, Krenwinkel, and Van Houten. He did not just function within the courtroom but also first hand conducted secondary investigations, analyses, and interviews. His extraordinary determination and dedication to the case were, in my opinion, the reason why these individuals were brought to justice. This man took a case that was obviously complex, based primarily on implications, and actually solved it. And he did not just solve it, he proved it true within court.Now, while reading this book, though exceptionally written, I found myself confused at times. This case had so many moving pieces that I would figure out one thing and then get walloped on the head by another. The amount of people involved in the murders and in the investigation was incredible. Just check out the 5 page list stated at the beginning of the book. Not to mention, the Family members went by multiple names, sometimes switching them with each other to make even more difficult. Bugliosi did a phenomenal job sorted out each person and being consist with names throughout the book, but I still found myself lost at times.Because I was so disoriented periodically throughout the book I did end up docking off a star. This is mainly a subjective issue. Due to my own bafflement my experience reading the book would, at times, be frustrating and disconnected. But when I did make the connections and understand what Bugliosi was trying to convey I absolutely loved it. Basically, the 4 star rating is solely based off of my overall enjoyment (if you could call it that) of reading the book. More than likely, especially if you are knowledgeable of the murders before reading this book, you might not face these problems at all.As I mentioned before, this novel effected me more than I had ever expected. Its social ramifications are still significant to this day. Did you know that Manson receives the most mail any inmate in America does, primarily from frustrated, rebellious youth? He resembles anti-establishment, anarchy, and freedom to some people. The murders he committed, the brainwashing he succeeded in, and the cult he built can easily happen again. The proof is in his 'fans'. At the end of the book Bugliosi explained why these murders effected Americans more than other big name serial killers. It's because they are not committed by one psychopath. The murders were committed by "America's children" brainwashed into doing so. That is powerful.This book change my understanding of what it means to working within the justice system. It also gave me a better understanding of the pop culture stemming from it (e.g. one of my favourite horror movies is based off these murders:The Strangers; and a recently published fiction novel I want to check out:The Girls). And ultimately, it gave me an even greater understanding of the power of cults and cult leaders have on the everyday person.If you are looking for an amazing True Crime novel, look no further. It will certainly creep you the fuck out, and possibly give you vivid nightmare, but man is it worth it![image error]1934-2015In the year of 2016 I decided to take part in an insane Genre Challenge.
