I can't say Imajica was a book I particularly enjoyed reading, but I nonetheless admire and respect the hell out of it. The breadth of Barker's imagination is extrodinary, and his writing style is sublime. And he has a lot to say; it's just that his concepts are a little too flighty and mystical for my taste. This book is Barker's attempt to write the Great American Fantasy Novel, and he pulls out all the stops. The fundamental problem with it for me is that I don't really care for the characters. I can't really buy into their romances in a meaningful way like I'm supposed to (I also could do without all the odd, frequent sex scenes, but then it would cease to be a Clive Barker novel), and they spend the majority of the book in a confused state without any clue as to their purpose or history. As with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I simply don't care for stories where people just aimlessly wander around a lot. This book is like an unresponsive engine on a cold day--it takes an aggrevatingly long time to kick into gear, and by the time it does, the journey doesn't seem nearly as appealing. Luckily (?), the book is longer than the LA Yellow Pages, and even after it meanders for the first four-hundred pages it still has another four-hundred fifty pages to make up for it. Don't even think about starting it unless you have a solid week of nothing to do but read. If you do make it all the way through, I think you will find it a rewarding--if somewhat forgettable--experience.
