I have read 18 of Louisa May Alcott's books, so I guess I can safely say that I am very familiar with her work. Some of them were very good, some not quite as good. All had that 19th century down home feeling with wonderful, memorable characters. But only one of her novels reached the level of what could be called literary greatness. Somehow, with this simple story, and these adorable characters, with a heart warming and heart wrenching plot, Alcott creates an American classic, her masterpiece. Yes it is dated, but Little Women will always have a place in our hearts, in our homes, and in the World's libraries.PS: I rewrote this review on 11/29/2016, in honor of her 184th birthday, and my birthday that I share with her, just with a slightly smaller number.
