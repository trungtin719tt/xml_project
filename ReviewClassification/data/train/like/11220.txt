I saw the John Adams miniseries on TV and then wanted to read this John Adams biography. Entertaining, interesting, and accessible, McCullough's biography didn't leave me disappointed. Lots of primary resources are used, and I learned a lot more than was covered in the miniseries (Paul Giamatti made for the perfect John Adams).
