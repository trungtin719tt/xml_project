Age recommended: age 4 and upThis is one of those gems that I loved so much I couldn't wait to read it to my child, but I also wanted to wait till she would really appreciate and comprehend it. Now she's four and a half and really enjoys it. It's one of those classics that you just have to own, and you don't get tired of reading, because it becomes more meaningful as you get older. Every time I read it it reminds me of who I am as a child of God. As my children get older, I'm excited to see what kind of conversations this story will spark.
