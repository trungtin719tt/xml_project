Whoa!!! This book is sooo good. It's really, really, REALLY fast-paced and action-packed. Even the very first chapter throws you headfirst into straight-on action. It's a very easy read, with short chapters that flow right into the other with cliffhangers. It's not something you can start/stop reading; once you start, there's no turning bag. You're dragged into the story from the very first page, willingly or not, and nothing can tear you from the book- only forceful things, like school, homework, parents, etc. While reading this book, I experienced rushes and throbbing through my head at all the excitement, thrill, and suspense. It felt like watching an intense action movie. And the end is a huge cliffhanger, making me sure that I'm going to attack the next book right away! This is good for anyone who wants to read a good, fast, exciting action book! :D
