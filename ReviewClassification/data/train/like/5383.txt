Johanna Spyri'sHeidiis a novel that is not only an enduring classic (first published in 1881, still going strong, a perennial favourite, and still remarkably enjoyable), but it is also one of those books that can be read and perhaps even should be read on a multitude of different and equally rewarding levels. And like with many children's classics I consider personal favourites, my review will consist of primarily musings and detailed analyses of certain parts and aspects of the narrative. I will also provide information on English language translations ofHeidiand possible considerations for choosing certain editions over others. Now this here particular edition ofHeidiis a German language Kindle version I recently downloaded on my iPad (both parts, complete, unabridged, and written in the new orthography, the "neue Rechtschreibung"). And indeed withHeidiin particular, one really does have to be careful avoiding abridged printings, unless one is actually desiring a shortened offering (for both in German and in English, and likely with many other languages as well, abridgements seem to exist en masse and sometimes, it is not even made clear that a particular edition has been significantly shortened, so potential readers beware, is my suggestion). Case in point, TWO of my hardback copies ofHeidi(German language), which I thought were unabridged when I purchased them, turned out to have significant parts of entire chapters removed (something that definitely was NOT mentioned on the book cover).HOW TO READ HEIDINowHeidican of course be read simply and enjoyably as a sweet tale of an adorable and personable young orphan whose soul and inner beauty shine, and who with her personality, with her love, her sweetness and tenderheartedness, and aided by many of her friends/family, especially her grandfather once he himself has been won over, brings not only joy but also health and wisdom to those around her (except of course her aunt Dete and perhaps the Frankfurt governess, who are just plain stubborn and never affected in a positive way by Heidi's charms and mannerisms). And well, these above-mentioned words are a very basic and for me as an older adult (and generally rather academic) reader, in no way sufficient analysis of Heidi's life and struggles, but it is a good place to start, and yes a decent way to whet a potential reader's appetite (especially a first time reader). However, readingHeidion purely a basic level, while more than appropriate and adequate for children and casual readers, really (in my opinion) only scratches the proverbial surface so to speak, and in a very much superficial manner at that. ForHeidiis deceptively simple, and underneath the descriptive joys of Swiss alpine glory and beauty, of what one can call a wholesome childhood, much darker and problematic material is indeed often hiding (and no pun is intended here). And yes, even the original German titles of the two parts parts ofHeidi,Heidis Lehr- und WanderjahreandHeidi kann brauchen, was es gelernt hatallude to the fact that Johanna Spyri is actually also harkening back to two of the most famous "Bildungsromane" (novels of development) in the German language, namely Johann Wolfgang von Goethe'sWilhelm Meisternovels (the first volume being being titledWilhelm Meisters Lehrjahreand the sequelWilhelm Meisters Wanderjahre).However, while in most traditional novels of development, it is generally the main protagonist who develops, who changes, who matures, Heidi herself really never all that much changes, never really develops and certainly never matures all that much. Her sojourn to Frankfurt, while it might have had the positive result of her learning to read (which she then later uses to bring joy to the grandmother and reading as a skill to the stubbornly illiterate Peter) and giving her more of an understanding of religion and patience, also proves once once for all that Heidi is for all intents and purposes not resilient, is not mentally and psychologically robust (that she will thrive only in a very limited and limiting environment, in the Alps, the Swiss mountains, and not just anywhere in Switzerland either, but specifically only on her grandfather's alpine meadows).And yes, many have both noticed and stated that Heidi's friend Clara is seemingly miraculously healed while on her alpine visit to Heidi (whether by God or due to the robust natural environment of the Alps is of course quite another question). But if one actually takes the time to consider a detailed characterisation of Clara, she is in fact and indeed (and right from the beginning ofHeidiat that) considerably more psychologically robust and resilient and thus also much more "healthy" than Heidi (at least on a spiritual and emotional level). Now when Clara is able to actually stand and walk, she is of course totally delighted that her physical strength has been restored (as are her father and grandmother), but in my opinion, Clara has truly always been considerably stronger than Heidi spiritually and psychically (and Clara is thus able to leave the Alps after her visit, after her "cure" but Heidi must forever remain in this specific place, as any other place will elicit not only homesickness, but the kind of homesickness that eats the soul, and will ultimately destroy the sufferer).Furthermore, whileHeidias a novel does (as mentioned above) allude to Goethe's Wilhelm Meister novels, the main character (Heidi) is actually more based on, more similar to the character of Mignon than Wilhelm Meister himself (except that unlike the doomed Mignon, Heidi is granted release and reprieve in so far that she is allowed to remain in and on the Alps, the one place that is suitable for and to her, unmoving, unchanging, but alive and to a point thriving, while Mignon is ultimately destroyed by her homesickness, by her yearning for Italy). And thus, from a purely developmental point of view and philosophy, Johanna Spyri's Heidi as a character is thus really and truly much less nuanced, much less rounded and much more unyielding and stagnant than her grandfather, than Clara (and yes, even than the stubborn and often annoyingly obstinate Peter).For yes, throughout the course ofHeidi, many of the encountered characters do seem to mature, to become healthier and heartier, increasingly educated and aware, but with Heidi, this really only occurs on a very sporadic and partial, superficial level at best (and mostly with regard to her ability to read, her trust in God and that she now sees and realises which household tasks require doing). Her mental and emotional stagnation, her lack of psychological fortitude (which she likely has inherited from her deceased mother), her inability to endure change of any kind and a variety of circumstances never really do all that much fluctuate (and with this in mind, Heidi is actually to be considered as being very much like those same alpine flowers encountered at the beginning of the novel, wildflowers that while bright, glowing and healthy while rooted in the alpine ground, very quickly lose their bloom, very quickly wilt and droop as soon as they are picked and transported away from the meadows they call home).HEIDI ENGLISH LANGUAGE TRANSLATIONSFor those readingHeidiin English or more to the point, desiring to read this book in English, there are indeed many, many different and vastly variable translations available (from 1882-1959 alone, something like fifteen different English language translations ofHeidiwere published). Now I have not read all of these, but I have read at least three separate English language editions, and each offers unique reading experiences. With regard to readability, flow, and if one is primarily reading for simple enjoyment (or to and with children), the 1956 translation by Eileen Hall is excellent and highly recommended (although many of the character names have been anglicised, and even some of the specific geographic references omitted). Earlier translations by Louise Brooks and Helen B. Dole, while they do retain a more slavish adherence to the original German text, are also translated in a much more literal manner and thus readability and narrative flow at times do rather suffer, feeling awkward and halting (in other words, one is often painfully aware of the fact that these are, in fact, translations). It is a matter of personal choice, but for me, for academic comparisons, I would tend to recommend the older translations ofHeidi, while for pleasure reading, Eileen Hall's translation is truly superb.
