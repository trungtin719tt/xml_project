This is a wonderful story that I absolutely adored reading over and over again to my kids. It has great sonorities to the words and is lots of fun. It is a great way for especially small kids to learn that just because mommy disappears for a little while, she will always come back - and sometimes with a tasty treat - yummy worms!! :)A must for kids!
