Beautiful writing, that is why this book gets four stars. But what do I mean by beautiful writing? That can mean so much. Here every sentence is simple. Every thought is simple. It is writing where all words that can be removedareremoved. What remains is clear and concise and beautiful. The core is left, and that core says exactly what has to be said.The book is about Africa, South Africa in particular and racial injustice in this country. It is about right and wrong and men's strengths and weaknesses. It is about Christian beliefs, but again whittled down to the most elementary concepts. It is not necessary to be religious to appreciate this book.You will be moved to tears.You will think: yes, this IS how life is, but dam we must go on fighting because along with sadness and injustice and wrong, there is beauty and kindness. Alan Paton says it all so honestly and so simply. I repeat: gorgeous writing.I can only judge from my own reading experience. I listened to an audio book, narrated by Michael York. The narration couldn't have been better. Perhaps if I had read it I would have appreciated the words less. Here, every word was spoken with depth and a calm measured strength. You are forced to think and ponder and savor. Would I have appreciated the cadence of the lines or the message imparted had I read the book with my eyes rather than my ears? I am not sure. Some books demand that they be read slowly.I haven't said one word about what happens. You must read the book to find out.
