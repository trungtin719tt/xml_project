The book that inspired the iconic Brad Pitt/Edward Norton film from 1999 is a wild ride every bit as gritty and crazy as the movie. I think the reveal comes a bit early in the book and that the movie actually did a better job of covering up the real identity of Tyler Durden. However, if you want to get down in all that liposuctioned fat and squirm around, this is the book for you. I thought the writing was OK, it did not inspire me to read any other Palahniuk books. Perhaps in the comments, folks could let me know if any are truly worth it or if this was his greatest book.I think I attempted another book of Palahniuk and never finished it...I guess you'd call it post-modern, but I really prefer DFW and even more Thomas Pynchon to this. I guess his style is like a mashup of DFW on acid channeling Michel Houellebecq or something like that.Perhaps someone reading this review can answer a question for me: is Bret Easton Ellis' writing style similar to that of Palahniuk? I get the impression that it sort of is and that I may not like American Psycho or his other books, but I have been putting them off for years.
