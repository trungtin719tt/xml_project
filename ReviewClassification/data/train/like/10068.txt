I chose this book one day when I was in the mood for something different than my usual fare of high fantasy, smart science fiction or classic literature. I spent a long time perusing the chick-lit shelves (not being a fan of the genre, normally) before settling on this book, and I was not disappointed with my choice.Holly is a widow who watched her husband die from a lengthy illness and is having a hard time dealing with it... But her husband has planned for that and has left her help in that arena. The book is by turns heart-breakingly sad and side-splittingly funny, sometimes in the same paragraph, and you will end up laughing through your tears or vice versa. It is sweet, poignant, and (usually) not too sappy or angsty and stresses the importance of family and friends during a soul-trying time of loss.
