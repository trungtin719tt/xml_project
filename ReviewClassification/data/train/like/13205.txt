Death on the Nile has to be one of my favourite books by Agatha Christie. I've read most of her books and I never get tiered of re-reading them :)There's something specially dark about this book and I happen to like it.As usual the characters are multi-dimensional and quite weird and scandalous lol. EVERYONE has a motive and an opportunity, anyone could've done it but I can never guess the right person with Agatha :)Very enjoyable and highly recommended.
