I first read this book in 1981 or thereabouts when I was married to my first husband. I had three children and felt completely trapped in a dangerously toxic, dead-end relationship that I saw no way out of.Still Life with Woodpecker, more than anything else, is about CHOICE. About using it, about the freedom it offers, and about being willing to accept the consequences for exerting it. Sometimes I would be reading and have to close the book up suddenly because I couldn't handle the implications in my own life. I desperately needed to make changes that I didn't know how to make, and I didn't see any way out of my life--I really felt I was living in hell. But I would pick the book back up, following the adventures of Princess Leigh-Cherie and the outlaw Bernard Mickey Wrangle as they figure out a way to make love stay. And I swear that in reading that book, I could pick myself up, dust myself off, and start over again. Ultimately, reading Still Life with Woodpecker catalyzed me and helped me to find the strength to leave that relationship and save myself and my children. Who could ask anything more of literature than that it save your life? Or at least inspire you to choose to save it?
