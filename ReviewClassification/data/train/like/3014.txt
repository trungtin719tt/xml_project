Mantric. Ethereal. Hypnotic. Goodnight Moon is pretty brilliant for a board book. Well done, Margaret Wise Brown.It rhymes. It repeats. And the pages alternate between color and black and white, perhaps suggesting that the little bunny is falling asleep and sees these objects in his mind or half-sleep. But it makes you wonder if any of this is real or if he's just imagining the clearly arbitrary colored bedroom in his dreams. It's like Inception but for kids and with bunnies. And much like that spinning top in Inception, the cow just keeps jumping over the moon.Clement Hurd's colors are intense. Green. Yellow. Orange red. I'm no art student or interior decorator, but damn, that's some serious clashing. Yet it really is visually striking, much like the graphic novel I just reread, Watchmen. Yes, I just compared Goodnight Moon to Watchmen. Clement Hurd is basically the Dave Gibbons of children's literature. Because of the abritrary, unrealistic and dreamlike use of color. It's psychedelic and crazy. But somehow my daughter likes to look at it.And at the root of it all, it helps her go to sleep. My wife and I have read this book pretty much every night (and some afternoons) since before my daughter was walking. It's comforting. And maybe it's just parental exhaustion, or I've been conditioned like my daughter, but it makes me sleepy just reading it.
