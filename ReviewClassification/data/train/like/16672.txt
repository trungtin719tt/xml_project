Spoiler Free Review5 STARSGenre: YA RomanceI own a SIGNED COPY!!!!"There are moments in every relationship that define when two people start to fall in love.A first glanceA first smileA first kissA first fall..."-Will in Point of RetreatThere are rare times when an author introduces you to a set of characters that you know will stick with you forever. For me this is one of those rare times.In Point Of Retreat Lake and Will are together and raising their brothers to the best of their ability. But just when we think everything is going good the past decides to show up and throw in her two cents... First off i must say i was so excited that Ms. Hoover wrote the book in Will's POV i love love loved that. In Point of Retreat we also get a few new characters Reece, Vaughn, Kiersten and Sherry two of them i instantly loved the other two not so much. One of the four i'm sure will touch a place deep within for everyone who reads this book. I thought the concept of the Vase of hearts was amazing I loved the conclusion to this beautiful series and i am happy to have had the chance to meet these chracters!:)My RatingsCharacters- Lovable, Admirable and WittyWriting Style- Solid, First Rate and WittyPlot/Storyline- Honest and IntenseOverall- A YA MUST READ
