Well. This book is terrible! I was told it had positive message and was filled with life lessons. Life lessons? Life Lessons!!! Why that boy and his dogs chased us all over the place and you don't want to know what happened when he caught us. No siree.Ricky.My cousin Rocky in the minutes before he was caught by Billy. (hands clearly up in surrender)
