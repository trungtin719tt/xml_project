I just LOVED this book! I really love the metaphors and the similie's... so great! Oh and your gonna blow when you hear this! The main characters LOVE waffles! See, see what did I tell you Queso... EVERYBODY love's waffles!Excerpt:"Now, see," Wes said, nodding at my plate, "this is going to blow your mind."I looked at him. "It's a waffle, not the second coming.""Dont be so sure. You haven't tasted it yet."I spread some butter on my waffle, then doused it with syrup before cutting off a small bite. Wes watched as I put it in my mouth. He hadn't even started his yet, as if first, he wanted to hear my verdict. Which was, pretty good. Damn good, actually. "Knew it," he said, as if he'd read my mind. "Maybe not the second coming, but a religious experience of sorts." Chapter XI. Page 221.Ahh... books like these are COMPLETE! Unlike those frilly frilly kind of books who DON'T have waffle's mentioned in thier book... THIS BOOKS JUSTS BLOW'S YOUR MIND! It's like a great book with the topping of delicious waffles! And the ending... simply amazing! Well in real life that was much too many events for one day... but hello, it is a book! I hated the mom in some parts and made me wanna like... RIP HER TO SHREDS?! But the way the author described exactly WHY she was acting this way was phenomenal~! The author truely does explore the mind and feelings of the main character making it seem so real! Ahaha Bert makes me laugh. :D
