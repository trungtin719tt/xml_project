Evanescence of MoralityMaybe it's my age where I find myself amidst a thousand questions because I like to think that I am understanding a little of what goes around. And as it goes with books, the count of unanswered questions is on an exponential run. Anyway, the most prominent and adamant question I find myself wrestle with these days is 'Morality'. The realms of it, the undefined criss cross intersecting patterns of it, the lawlessness and sometimes the hypocritical pride of it, and lastly the chameleon ethos of it.History has tested us on our understanding and ever changing definitions of this time designed morality and we have shown some bizarre reactions to it. This last novel by the master is one such peephole into the American society of mid 20th century where morals were having a t(r)ough time (not that we are on any high these days). Corruption and greed had laid its wrath on an aristocratic family from a small east coast town, as a result the last standing member has nothing but his name to remind him constantly of things his family had lost, of things he would probably have been a heir to if not for the lecherous times.Ethan Allen Hawley finds himself being a clerk of a grocery store with disillusionment looming over every single minute of his life until on one insomniac night he strolls towards the port where his grandfather's ship used to anchor, and something sets itself in motion because he realized that things can't remain the way they are forever.When a man is discontent about something that is too important to him, he changes one fine day into a different man, looks at things differently, says new words. The cosmic equation modifies itself and subconscious mind takes over the reins of future.This is a unique book by Steinbeck. He has power packed the prose with many of the life's learnings as he usually does, but this time the reader is at the edge of his seat questioning and nodding at every move Ethan makes, stretching the flimsy cloth of morality at the turn of every chapter, finding redemption, anguish, empathy, and a cacophony of emotions at the end(which was Dostoevskysk in many ways). For many more reasons that I'm finding difficult to incorporate here, this book is an absolute shiner.
