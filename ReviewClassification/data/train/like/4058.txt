" - the Devil is alive in Salem, and we dare not quail to follow wherever the accusing finger points!"Though Miller claims to have had an abiding interest in the Salem Witch Trials, we all know this play was written as a giganticScrew You!to Senator Joseph McCarthy and his investigations into alleged Un-American activities. The amazing thing is how well the play works on its own. Even if you know nothing of McCarthyism, you will still be moved by the plight of a small Massachusetts village wracked by lies, spitefulness and cruelty."I saw Sarah Good with the Devil! I saw Goody Osburn with the Devil! I saw Bridget Bishop with the Devil!"In one of the most chilling scenes, young girls begin rattling off the names of seemingly every woman in the village. That the townsfolk would take the word of a few of teenagers seems hard to believe, but darker forces were at work here. Men more concerned with their reputations and the chance to fill their coffers than they were fearful of actual witchcraft were in charge, and they grabbed the opportunity to settle old grudges and steal a neighbor's land. The girls, many stinging from slights both real and imagined, reveled in their newly found power to wreak vengeance against their former mistresses and employers.This is truly a depiction of humanity at its worst.When John Hale, a visiting reverend who has been charged with investigating Salem's little witch problem, declares:"No man may longer doubt the powers of the dark are gathered in monstrous attack upon this village."- he has no idea how right he is, though this darkness has nothing to do with the supernatural. It seems we are always willing to believe the worst in others; that they might be witches, or Communists or terrorists.It seems that no matter what the evidence, we continue to believe what we want to believe.If nothing else, this play serves as a cautionary tale.Will we listen and learn?
