The big question in my head most of this book, was "who is the target audience?" Nobody in the book is over 15 (despite the 18-year-olds on the awful cover), so you'd think 13 or 14 year-olds, but at close to 600 pages, I can't see most of them reading this. And if you get too old, stories about abandoned children--babies--dying of neglect might bother you, or maybe even stories where you'd have disappeared because you've hit your 15th birthday. But despite all that, it's a great premise with a lot of fantastic twists that drive the story forward. I'd say this is one of those few YA books that really appeals to guys more than girls.My other question was: is there really that much of a hierarchy of bullies and that many sociopaths in any given society? I realize when society breaks down, so does civilization, but that many "bad kids" was a little unbelievable for me. However, some of those villains are very strong though and thoroughly creepy and they were great assets to the tension in the story. All the characters are very well fleshed out. And the other characters are very likable. Sam is the quiet kid who acts heroically when disaster is thrust upon him and Astrid the quiet know-it-all with a big heart. No matter what had happened, I would have been interested in their story and rooted for them.Grant did a good job adding twists and turns and unexpected problems along the way. It's a very creative story. I was a little disappointed with the open ending, but all-in-all a good read. Those meet-doom-around-every-bend thrillers aren't my favorite (thus why I'd recommend the book more to guys than girls), but it's well written and creative. I can only imagine where Grant takes the series from here.
