So creepy and chilling. So much more readable than I anticipated. I love how you just can't get out of the trap of accusation and hysteria. I also loved the evolution of John and Abigail. I learned a lot about the Salem Witch Trials, which was so cool! I didn't realize how steeped in fact this play is!
