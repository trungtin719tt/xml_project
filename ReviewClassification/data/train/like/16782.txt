4.5 starsThis was just as good as the first time I read it years back. It's so much fun following the characters (especially Ash, who's amazing) and watching Meghan grow into someone stronger (finally). Plus, the world-building is original and intriguing - I never felt bored while reading this.Well, it's onto re-reading the final book!
