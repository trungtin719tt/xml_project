Barely begun, I have more left! The fantastic adventures of the man with the severed head and demonic cat that disappears and reappears at will (among others) soothes me. What a brilliant storyteller that this Russian writer of the last century! The appearance of Marguerite Nikolaievna, the lover of the Master - 30 years, beautiful, smart, and married - without children - a very eminent specialist early in the second part of the story was very bewitching and for good reason, and thanks to Azazello his little box of ointment, she regains her youth and better is our beloved Witch, straddling a broom to fly in the air to our delight! All this fantastic poetry worthy of Lewis Carroll (the trickster cat) we turn the head so that one does not dwelling the deeper the theme is in many Russian works, Czech or other: gravity their bureaucracy, their repressive system (cf. the Stravinski psychiatrist), the problems of housing and food (see the house of DRAMLIT - House playwrights and writers), ... From the beginning, we see that the writer is not free: it must join the system and integrate a literary society for recognition. In Moscow, it is called MASSOLIT and its president, who is also the editor of a thick literary magazine has from the beginning a plight! To this, we can see that Mikhail Bulgakov is against this abuse of power and research at all costs more freedom in a country that holds them back. The story that runs parallel to Pontius Pilate, Judas and Jesus Christ is also very endearing. We see the procurator of Judea filled with remorse, as in the myth of Sisyphus, it will be for centuries and centuries eternally tormented by his act. I just read it but I still reread with pleasure some years later. A beautiful book.
