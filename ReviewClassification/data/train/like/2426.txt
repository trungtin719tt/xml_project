Never judge a book by its shitty cover, just finish and then judge it.Will give an updated review of how being a Gemini(have split personalities), makes this book so relatable.Gemini all have a split personality.People might say that then all of them should end up in a mental institution.It is very much part of our lives and the only way is to embrace it.So what are the crazy extremes that a Gemini can be:Donald Trump(His evil twin controls him) and then we have Bob Dylan(Embracing the creativity and Wordsmith of a Gemini).Gemini's arealways looking for stories or creating new ones.Sociable, adventurous and just have natural spark to look for exciting things in life(Music, stories, Travel, Culture, Languages, people).If you do come across one, either by dating or friendship just expect an exciting person who sees's life in various perspectives.Well, a true Gemini's drawback is his romantic side.The true bad boy of romance(does not believe in forever more), basicallya reality check for romantics as Gemini's live for the moments.Flirtatious, fun, charming in conversations, how can this person not be romantic!!Well, the partner of a Gemini has got to embrace a person who is adventurous in real life and even in bedroom antics.Let us justsay it is not about dominance but about the experiences, understanding and even listening(gives them an edge).Gemini's hate dominant people so do not expect to be respectedjust like that.Give him his/her freedom and you will be rewarded with adventure from time to time.You are either going to hate/love/get angry with this fun loving a spirited person.True Romantics will be definitely challenged by this person.But to meet aGemini is an experience.So why live without one!!Remember not every person is the same, but you will come across these traits in Gemini's for sure.
