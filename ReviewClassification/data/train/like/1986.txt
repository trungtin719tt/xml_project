Like I have already mentioned in my review ofHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, it is definitely noticeable that Rowling's writing style has improved massively compared to the first two books in the series. The amount of suspense and foreshadowing was incorporated very well and made the reading experience so much fun. I found myself constantly holding my breath towards the end, there were so many twists and turns! I have actually seen the movie version before, but I forgot much of it, so I was extremely surprised at some of the reveals. The build up towards those situations was just perfect!I loved that we got to see a bit more interaction between muggles and wizards in the beginning, as well as more scenes outside of Hogwarts. It was a nice change and helped bring a bit more realism to the story (it was nice to see that wizards and witches get excited over such a normal thing as a sport event, too!).One of my favorite things in the book was the portrayal of friendship. Harry, Ron and Hermione were depicted as normal teenagers, who sometimes just happen to fight over the stupidest little things. I feel like that really brought their friendship forward, in a way.I, in general, feel like there was a lot of progress and development in the book. I haven't read the following books yet, so I obviously can't say how much of what happened in this one will play a part later, but I still feel like I learned so many new things about the world this story takes place in and about the characters in it. And oh man, how much I just love those characters...
