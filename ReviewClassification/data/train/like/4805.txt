Janet Fitch has an amazing gift for writing novels centered around protagonists that are flawed and scarred, while at the same time making her audience identify with and even love these characters because of their imperfections. Take Astrid, the main character of White Oleander. At the beginning of the story, Astrid's mother goes to jail for poisoning an ex-boyfriend and Astrid is placed in a series of foster homes. During the course of the story, Astrid sleeps with her foster father (at age thirteen, no less), befriends a prostitute, begs for money in the street, sleeps with a theif, and gives a boy a blowjob in exchange for a bag of pot. But at the same time, Fitch presents Astrid as a sensitive, intelligent, and artistically gifted young girl who's just trying to survive - and life sure likes to screw this girl over. Almost every foster home she's placed in is filled with danger and people who should never be allowed to care for anyone, ever. But Astrid survives, and her story is heartbreaking, disturbing, and ultimately beautiful.
