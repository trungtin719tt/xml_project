T, is for Twain.3.5 StarsIf you have ever been a young girl you have learned one unavoidable fact; boys are the worst!They are self-absorbed, morbid and cruel. They'll call you names, pull on your hair and treat you entirely like crap....The Adventures of Tom Sawyerrevolves around, surprise, a young troublemaker named Tom. To my way of thinking Tom is a fairly good example of the average youngster. While his adventures may be grander than most, his selfishness and lack of compassion is not. (I am by no means saying that young girls are any kinder, they AREN'T!)He worries his haggard Aunt Polly ceaselessly, gallivanting around without a care in the world for how such hair-brained adventures into the great unknown will make her feel. (I feel so bad for Polly in this story.)It's a good little story Twain's got here. Do I think it should be required reading?No!Mainly because of the bellow noted quote.Now he found out a new thing - namely, that to promise not to do a thing is the surest way in the world to make a body want to go and do that very thing.(Which in it's reverse says that that which we are told to do is ultimately less appealing.)I believe the true art of Twain's writing can only be appreciated if it is a choice - similar to my feelings on Shakespeare actually.
