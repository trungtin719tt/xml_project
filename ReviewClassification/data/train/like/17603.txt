A common criticism of Peretti is that the writing isn't that great. It isn't wonderful, I'll grant you that, but it's certainly not intrusively bad. Another common criticism is the personification and representation of angels and demons, and that may depend on your personal theology. I'm not sure where my belief falls there, though I know those particular ones aren't real, but that's less important.Whatisimportant, and unique about this book, to my mind, is the way it made spiritual warfarerealto me. Before, I could never fully understand it but this book gave me a glimpse of why prayerisimportant, however it works in real life. It gave me an idea of why it could be important to pray, to listen to the Spirit when we're prompted to pray, why God won't intervene unless we ask Him, and what might happen when we do obey.
