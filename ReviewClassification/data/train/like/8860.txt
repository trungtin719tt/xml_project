i've been reading these for years. there have always been a few that took me by surprise, but lately i find this whole collection to be a really astonishing experiment in language - it's taken me years to see how modern she is (for you dickinson fans, i'm sure you're saying, well, DUH!). i say this because her work really is a kind of minimalism. she seems to to have more patience than most poets. she waits until the perfect formation of sounds and meanings emerge in just the right crystalline formation, and then she stops. and if you are also patient, you begin to see how perfectly each one is shaped, conceived, delivered. i also applaud her for never using titles...the poems are all numbered.****************summer (august) of 2012 -i'm finally getting around to setting some of these wonderful poems to music - i'm writing for string orchestra, piano and mixed choir.i've chosen the following poems to set:#254#446#447#1444#1448#1676#1659#1654#1655and so far, i have composed music for:#254#446#447#1448ideally, i would like to have seven to set in a suite.*************************forgot to update this - set the 9 poems, and it was performed last december. i'm finally getting a recording of the work to check out - looking forward to seeing it (it was videotaped) ... i was so busy conducting the work that i hardly had time to experience it with any clarity.
