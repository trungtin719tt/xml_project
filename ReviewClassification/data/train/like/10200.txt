I didn't have high expectations for this classic but I was pleasantly surprised. The first half of the play can be a little slow as the characters are developed but the story and action builds throughout the remainder of the play.Cyrano is a noble man and De Guiche is a believable villain. Roxane and Christian are more one dimensional but as the play is part farce it's not so consequential.Well worth the read and in the public domain.
