I'll start by saying that I'm not much of a "dog person" and nor am I a race car fan. I've never been to Seattle, and the novel as fable genre has not done much for me. That being said, after "The Art of Racing in the Rain" - I need a new dog, I drive faster, and I loved this book.I had stumbled across three reviews of this book within one 24 hour period, so I felt like I was being led to read this book that on the surface help only a small appeal - a story from a dog's perspective - pretty unique for me.It's the story - at it's core - of Denny and Enzo, man (race car driver among other things) and dog (hoping his father was a terrier among other things). True companions that move through a series of events that lead, as life often does, to heart rendering triumphs and heart breaking tragedies, all as told from Enzo's canine perspective as he looks back on his life as he prepares himself for his soul's next life.The story struck me from the beginning and I just didn't want it to end. Not only because it was entertaining reading, but also as meaningful reading. "You manifest what is before you" is one of the philosophical perspectives that the author uses to tie together dog and man, racing and life, and so many other relationships in the story.Intertwined stories of faith, family, failure, hope, and perseverance makes this a very special tale and one I am glad I stumbled upon.
