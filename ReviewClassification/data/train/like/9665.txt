The Elephant Tree was recommended to me by a fellow crime-thriller fan. Debut novels can be a little hit-and-miss as a writer finds his (or her) style. The Elephant Tree definitely sits in the category of HIT!The back of the book gives only a glimpse in to the plot and the seedy world occupied by well written, interesting characters. The plot is always exciting and leads you in a world of drug deals and violence, where you don't know who to trust.This is a fantastic thriller and one I'm sure I'll read again on a regular basis.
