http://angelerin.blogspot.com/2016/08...To be honest This Lullaby took me a bit of time to read. To start off I really haven't been in the mood for this genre. I decided to make it my pool read for a while and so I read it pretty slowly. Even though I read it slowly and I wasn't really in the mood for it, I still enjoyed it a lot once I got into it.#ItsMeNotYouI love how Remy and Dexter are so different, but they fit together really well. I love their romance and also I can relate to Remy in some ways. She's a bit of a hard ass on the outside and a little bit anal, but she's secretly a softie!! Dexter is very flawed, but he's super sweet and I love that accepts Remy for who she is. I just really enjoyed reading a book about a guy that can see through a girl's bitchy facade and into her heart. I love how Dexter could see that Remy has gone through things in her life and she's just trying to protect herself. It reminded me a little bit of my hubby and myself when we first got together actually. I'm sure that's part of why I like the romance so much.#AwwwSweetRomanceOverall I really like This Lullaby quite a bit. It's not my favorite book ever, but that's okay they all can't be favorites. Plus it was a struggle to get through at times because I wasn't in the mood the genre. However, I found it to be very relatable and I love when I can connect to the characters. Also, the romance is top notch! This is the second Sarah Dessen book that I've read and it certainly won't be the last!#RelatableAndEnjoyableI recommend This Lullaby for YA Romance fans looking for a great pool/beach read!!#QuickToThePoolBeforeSummerIsOver!
