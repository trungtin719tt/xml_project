It feels a little bit goofy to rate a Little Golden Book as five stars, butThe Monster at the End of this Book, written byJon Stoneis just that adorable. Grover Monster from Sesame Street is at his endearing best as he does his very best (despite great trepidation on his part) to protect the reader from the scary monster at the end of the book. Pages come alive as Grover hides inside the binding and behind torn pages when things get too scary for poor little Grover to handle by himself. Children will delight in each page they turn.
