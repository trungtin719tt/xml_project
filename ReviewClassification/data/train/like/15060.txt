I loved this book! It's definitely a must read for everyone. Here are a couple of my favorite quotations from the book:(During a conversation between Cassie and her mother after Cassie is treated horribly by Lillian Jean Simms and her father):"I didn't say that Lillian Jeanisbetter than you. I said Mr. Simms onlythinksshe is. In fact, he thinks she's better than Stacey or Little Man or Christopher-John--""Just 'cause she's his daughter?" I asked, beginning to think Mr. Simms was a bit touched in the head."No, baby, because she's white."Mama's hold tightened on mine, but I exclaimed, "Ah, shoot! White ain't nothin'!"Mama's grip did not lessen. "It is something, Cassie. White is something just like black is something. Everybody born on this earth is something and nobody, no matter what color, is better than anybody else."Here's the other quote I really like:(Uncle Hammer chastising Stacey after Stacey foolishly gives away his brand new coat)"If you ain't got the brains of a flea to see that this T.J. fellow made a fool of you, then you'll never get anywhere in this world. It's tough out there, boy, and as long as there are people, there's gonna be somebody trying to take what you got and trying to drag you down. It's up to you whether you let them or not...If you want something and it's a good thing and you got it in the right way, you better hang on to it and don't let nobody talk you out of it. You care what a lot of useless people say 'bout you you'll never get anywhere..."
