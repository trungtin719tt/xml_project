Mind-blowingly awesome. I only wish that for the first book that I read of Borges that it was either all short stories or all essays; I had difficulty making the transition from the last story to the first essay because the lyrical cadence of his writing style made his beautifully written essays seem almost fictive. The parables at the very end of the compilation were the cherries on top. Borges' love of all things Quixote makes me want to hunker down with that book and read, re-read, and re-re-read it until it has the mantric effect that it apparently had on him. Dostoevsky made me want to learn Russian to read him in his native language - Borges has the same effect on me w.r.t. Spanish. I'm reminded yet again how embarrassing it is to be an American monoglot.
