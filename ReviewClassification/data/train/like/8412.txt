Okay, I do agree the grammar is horrible, as well as the dialogue, and the way P.C. Cast always repeats things that her regular readers already know. Like when she keeps repeating how "The cats choose the fledgling," like seriously shut the freak up already! I also have some issues about what happened with the Zoey charater and Loren Blake. I mean, I just find it sickening that Zoey is supposed to be this strong, smart, independant young woman, yet, she's not intellegent enough to not have sex with a grown man!? Even though there's so many things wrong with it, I'm still totally in love with the series. Maybe Untamed will be better...hopefully(:
