Charles Manson and"his family"reigned terror throughout an affluent LA community back in 1969 after the brutal mass murder of more than seven people....an unforgettable time if you grew up in the sixties. Prosecuting Attorney, Vincent Bugliosi gives the reader a technically detailed and vividly descriptive account of the true-crime murder trial, and the motivation(view spoiler)[(to instill fear in the establishment and cause paranoia)(hide spoiler)]behind the mind of a killer.And whileallthe murders were certainly atrocious and unforgivable, what the bloodthirsty animalistic Susan Atkins did, not only to an eight and a half month pregnant Sharon Tate, but the disgustingactthrust upon her own baby made me sick!(not to mention what she did on the landing inside a building)One of my favorite BEATLE songs(I Will)is on their White Album, and after reading this unsettling story, I don't think I will ever listen to it again without thinking of the human monster who believed messages within the lyrics were being sent to him(via code)to start an inter-racial war.It is not surprising thatHelter Skelterwon the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best crime novel....it is truly a horror story....so read at your own risk!Was startled and sorry to hear of Mr. Bugliosi's passing just a few days ago.....especially when CM is still above ground living off taxpayer dollars.Vincent Bugliosi: August 18, 1934 - June 6, 1015.....A Brilliant and Brave Man! Rest in Peace.(Thank you GR friend Susan for information regarding "Aquarius", a TV series on the Manson murders now showing On Demand)Update: June 11, 2015Had a marathon day of watching the entire first season ofAquarius......Yikes! Sadie (Susan Atkins) and CM were their despicable selves as depicted in the book,(although not quite as bad.....yet)and there are other characters who were disgustingly evil as well! I really did get a kick out of the vintage telephones, TV's, home decor and OMG the clothing and automobiles sure brought a smile to my face........but will there be a Season 2?
