Paul gave me this for Christmas...I think in 2015, but maybe it was 2014 - a conundrum which shows my fluid and slippery relationship with time...and it was one of the best gifts I've ever been given. I already had most of the previously published collections, but this made my life complete. If I could take only one book with me to a desert island (I don't know why this scenario would even occur) then it would be this one. Bill Watterson, I love you!
