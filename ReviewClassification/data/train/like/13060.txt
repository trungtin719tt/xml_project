"Sweet Crescent Moon,Up in the sky,You sing your song so sweetly,After sunshine passes by."Stars above,this was one heck of a bookI'll be honest,I can't think of a proper way to start this review other than saying that i really enjoyed this book (what a surprise).In fact, i enjoyed it so much that i can't find the words to describe my love for it, and for the lunar chronicles as a whole.But I think it's safe to say by now, that this is my absolute favorite series of all times.Let's kick things off by talking about the plot,In this installment, We continue from where we left things off in the previous book, in adittion to the introduction of Cress and her unique story.This book was action-packed and well plotted. There were always exciting events and secrets revealed, that constantly kept me on the edge of my seat, reading to find out more .It was alsovery funny, And I often found myself laughing out loud at certain jokes and actions during the course of this story.Overall, i would say that it was an exciting, funny and really engaging plot.Moving on to the characters,In this book, we are introduced to Cress, who has been trapped in a satellite (cool right?) completely isolated for most of her life.I really liked Cress and her quirky, awkward personality (which was really entertaining to read about in some parts). And i found her to be a great ,fun and interesting addition to the story.Moreover, I noticed that there was a focus on character development in this book, which is ALWAYS a good thing.We also got to know each individual character in a better - more intimate manner.Now last but certainly not least, i would like to talk about Marissa Meyer's writing ,I personally really like Marissa's writing style, i think it suits the story very well,Her writing is not too descriptive(which i consider to be a good thing), but yet she manges to portray the world and the characters so well, making the story feel so real and alive !Now, i talked about Marissa's writing in my review ofCinder,But i decided to talk about it again just to address the Improvement that I saw in her writing, pacing and overall story telling, which can be clearly seen in this book.Also, i think it's worth mentioning that this book had ALOT of different point of views, and story settings often changed.I was a bit taken off at first by the amount of POVs in this book, but as i read on, Meyer proved to be very talanted at merging all these storylines together to create a one big-EPIC overall story.Bottom lineis that this book was awesome !It's well written, well plotted,and, well.... JUST EPIC.So,If you're someone who is debating whether or not to continue on with this series , I would highly recommend reading this book, because things DO get crazy and exciting,And i promise it's completely worth it !My reviews for previous books in this series :CinderScarlet
