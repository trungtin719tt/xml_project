Oliver Twist by Charles Dickens is a wonderful classic fiction novel. The child as a protagonist was something which appealed to me for me to pick up this read, and the narration doesn't disappoint. The journey the character's life takes from its inception till the story ends is mesmerizing. The picture painted of an orphan kid in Victorian-era England is vivid, along with detailed mentions to the status difference among various social classes of the time, and the various atrocities that follow.The book is dark throughout. The happy ending is a much-needed relief. I am generally not an advocate of impractical happy endings, but Dickens' pure genius can be explained from the fact that even I was craving for a happy end to Oliver's fate - he makes you want it more-and-more as the story progresses. The satire employed in the narration is like icing on the cake.I haven't watched the movie yet, though it is on my list.Verdict: Recommended.
