Group read with the Non-Crunchy Pantsless Classics people!Technically this is the June buddy read... whoops.Not sure why I've stayed away from HG Wells as long as I have; I've heard of his stories many times and know they belong to the classic canon -- The Time Machine, The War of the Worlds, The Invisible Man, The Island of Dr Moreau -- but this is the first I've read and I have to say I enjoyed it.It particularly had a hand in urging me toward Jekyll &amp; Hyde for our October read (and I'll likely read it either way come Halloween time) thanks to the way the story, or at least part of it, is told by a character who is seeing things from outside the main character's point of view. That is, our narrator is retelling the story to the reader as it is being told to him by the time-traveler. John Utterson does this in a similar fashion in the Jekyll &amp; Hyde story, if memory serves me.Anyway, the story itself was beautifully told and very suspenseful. Scott Brick did an excellent job narrating, as always, and I'm looking forward to stumbling across Wells again in the future.
