I like that at the end of this book, when the mother comes home and the text reads:Should we tell her about it?Now, what SHOULD we do?Well...What would YOU doIf your mother asked YOU?My daughter always looks up at me and says: I would tell you.But I don't believe her. I think it's quite possible that the Cat in the Hat has already been here, and she's just telling me what I want to hear.
