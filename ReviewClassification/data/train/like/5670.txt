This book is a master class in writing a novel. First of all you have a solid story which takes you down the path and never wanders too far. Every element adds to the story, none of the side plots or extra details take anything away, they just keep adding to it. Secondly you have a cast of wonderful characters who are three dimensional and real. None of the characters feel unnecessary and they all add to the over all feeling of the book. There are two main stories in this book. One is of Evelyn Couch and Mrs Threadgoode in the 1980's. The other is of Idgie, Ruth, and Whistle Stop ranging from the 1920's all the way through to the present day of Evelyn and Mrs Threadgoode. Both stories are full of life, and love, and discovery. They are so immersive that you can't help but be sucked up into the world of the novel. There are twists and turns and fluffiness galore. How a book manages to be simultaneously serious, hard hitting, and fluffy, I have no idea but this book manages it. The book explores many themes. It tackles racism, the wars, feminism, morals, murder, self-discovery, and it serves them all up in a very tasty dish (pun intended). I was so emotionally invested in the characters that I cried several times throughout this book and that doesn't happen often when I read. I am eternally grateful that I was on the balcony of my hotel room when I read the last part of the book, where only my Mum was able to see me full on ugly crying, and not by the pool where all the other guests of the hotel would have thought I was crazy. This novel touched me and I have discovered a new favourite book along with new favourite characters and a new favourite couple (OTP alert!). I can not recommend this book highly enough. It's beautiful and charming and deserves every ounce of praise that it gets.
