The ending of Untamed was epic, even Jenna Lamia's voice is growing on me. The prophecy is chilling and to think of Zoey as the reincarnation of her Cherokee women's elements is unbelievably genius! (ironically A-ya is a Cherokee word meaning 'me').I just thought of that!! Zoey actually is Captain Planet:Stevie Rae Johnson: "EARTH!"Shaunee Cole: "FIRE!"Damien Maslin: "WIND!"Erin Bates: "WATER!"Zoey Redbird: "SPIRIT!"Her friends: "Go Priestess!"Zoey: "By your powers combined, I am PRIESTESS ZOEY!"Her friends:Priestess Zoey, she's our heroGonna take Kalona down to zeroShe's our powers magnifiedAnd she's fighting on the planet's sidePriestess Zoey, she's our heroGonna take Kalona down to zeroGonna help her put asunderBad vamps who like to loot and plunderNeferet: "You'll pay for this Priestess Zoey!"Her friends:We're the VampiresYou can be one tooAphrodite LaFont:'Cause saving our planet is the thing to do!Looting and polluting is not the wayHear what Priestess Zoey has to say!Nyx: "The Power is Yours!"The ending of Hunted was epic as well, but I think I still like Heath the best from all Zoey's guys, Stark is cool but not sure yet. Aphrodite is my favorite in the series.
