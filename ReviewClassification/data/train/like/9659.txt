The Elephant Tree by R. D. RonaldBook starts out with a team of Scott and Neil supplying drugs to the local folks at the clubs they frequent.They make quite a profit but Scott wants a quieter life so he agrees to try a different venture to gain big money quick.Scott's brother Jack has warned him to stay away from the guys he's been hanging out with...Angela-once dated Jack years ago has now found Scott and their lifes mesh with one another.Things don't go according to plan on the venture but some things do over time.Love the detailed descriptions of the places and events of the holiday, seasonal weather and even new words for me.Just one really gory part with a hammer but this would make an awesome movie-similar to ones I've seen on TV and enjoyed. Kind of like gangsters doing what they do.Lots of action, adventure, drugs, love and especially love the cave and everything it stands for.Jeff and Scott do have the plans to make it all work but there are wrinkles along the way-Angela is taken...Like what elephant tree stands for them all in the end.Just a handful of characters that intertwine as the story goes on. Easy to keep track of them all.Found there is an extra story within this one: past lives of their parents, letters come to surface that play a big part in the end.Found English way of spelling words kinda throws me off a bit. Was a cool book to hear from the drug dealers side of the story and how things run for them.Would like to read more from this author.Received this review copy from the author and this is my honest opinion.
