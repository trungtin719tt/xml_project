I, Ana, take you, Mr. Rochester, to be my lawful wedded husband (I'm sure my boyfriend won't mind).Back off fangirls, he is mine.I needed something to make me stop thinking about Heathcliff and Catherine and theirhorrorlove story. So, naturally, I chose Jane Eyre. Yes, it's dark but nowhere nearly as scary as Wuthering Heights. It's actually quite romantic. Ok, he locked his wife in the attic. In those days people didn't get divorced. If you had a crazy spouse, you locked them in the attic. That's how it was done. Let's cut Mr. Rochester some slack."I knew," he continued, "you would do me good in some way, at some time: I saw it in your eyes when I first beheld you; their expression and smile did not strike delight to my inmost heart so for nothing."
