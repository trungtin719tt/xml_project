The classic and best of all Golden Books! This certainly brings back fun memories of reading as a child. There were many Little Golden Books on my childhood shelf growing up, but this one easily received the most wear and tear. It was very funny, and I loved having it read aloud. As a reader, you're being urged to stop reading and turning pages, but yet you continue on through the book. It creates an interaction that is popular in a lot of current children's books. Just as I previously reviewed not having a strong attachment to Goodnight Moon, this one is the opposite and enhances my rating!
