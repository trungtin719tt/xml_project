I'm not sure why I only saw the movie and never read the book. I loved the movie so much it makes no sense, but back in the day, not many things make sense to me.I will have to go back and watch the movie again to see all of the different little changes. Now I know why some things happened. You know those things, the little things that are only in the head, written in the book, but doesn't show up in the movie part. Wow! I know the book messed with my head but I didn't realize it would make me write that way! I hope anyone reading this can understand what I meant.I really did enjoy the book, although I did feel a bit crazier than I am at times with all of the voices in everyone's head! :)I didn't want one of the bad things that happened in the movie to NOT happen in the book. I didn't want to read that part and lo and behold, it didn't happen! Yay!The ending in the book was a lot better than the movie. Once again, I really did enjoy this book and look forward to reading and re-reading more of the golden oldies!
