I loved this book, but it took a while/couple of tries that I actually finished the book.The thing that I wished there was more of is Arlen training.And I wish there was not as much jump in the timeline, where we don't see Arlen, and that Arlen was the only character that we saw, him coming of age, and training. That would be more traditional. So that the other two main point of view characters of Leesha and Rojer were unneeded in my opinion.
