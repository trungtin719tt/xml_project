"I have in my heart of hearts a favourite child, and his name is David Copperfield"- Charles Dickens.As aHUGEfan of Sir Charles Dickens, I can't say this is a normal book. This is his most personal one, according to himself.Why 4 out of 5 stars? Because it was kind of difficult to digest it a bit, I had to go through some pages more than once and try to get the origin of some characters, but most of them are in my head now. Easy to fall in love with them, and the story itself is kind of unforgettable mixing an orphan boy, lovely adventures, interesting trials, among others. If I were a villain someday (hope not), I would like to be like Uriah Heep.A very nostalgic book, a totalmustof Classic Literature, I will totally re-read it as soon as I can.I am very proud of my name being "Charles" in Spanish version, even if it was just by coincidence.Recommended? Absolutely! It's aClassic!and you can learn a lot of one of the most important all-time writers: Charles Dickens.
