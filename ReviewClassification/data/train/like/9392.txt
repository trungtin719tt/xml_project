3.5 The First Gift of Christmas StarsThis book is a short little Christmas story about a young boy who finds a train to the north pole, in front of his house, very late one Christmas Eve, and so the story goes on from there.I remember enjoying this short, Christmas story when I was a child, and years later, I still rather like it, and I enjoy the illustrations as well.
