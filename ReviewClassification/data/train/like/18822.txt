So good, I read it twice. There is a great sense of place for this book, the imagery is truly enchanting and visceral. What I really like about the novel is how grounded in reality it is, making the magic seem entirely plausible in its subtlety. The pain and drama of the characters make them three dimensional and completely relatable.I was left with only two questions:1. Is there a sequel to this?2. If not, why the hell isn't there?!ETA February 2015: There is asequel!Special thanks toChristinato alerting me to this :D
