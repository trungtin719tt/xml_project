An absorbing and sumptuous eulogy for the end of the golden age of the British aristocracy. Beautifully written and with so much to enjoy: faith and - in particular - Catholicism, duty, love, desire, grandeur, decay, memory, and tragedy.At its heart there is a beautiful and enchanting story.The various characters, right down to the most minor ones, are stunningly and credibly drawn - having just finished the book I feel that I have been amongst them and known them.I have read most of Evelyn Waugh's novels and this is his finest*. If you haven't read it yet I envy you.*EDIT:Sword of Honourruns it a very close second.I also heartily recommend readingMad World: Evelyn Waugh and the Secrets of BridesheadbyPaula Byrnewhich gives lots of helpful background information aboutBrideshead Revisited. I was amazed at the extent to which it was based onEvelyn Waugh's own experiences and those of people he knew.Click here to read my review
