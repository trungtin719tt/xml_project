An incredible read and a page turner. Part crime story, part trial story. Based on actual events in the lake areas of the Adirondacks in upper NY state, I read this with the Classics for Beginners group. Also, my mother lived in this area when I was just a toddler.Dreiser's pure genius is that he makes the reader become very sympathetic with the protagonist Clyde Griffiths, son of religious evangelists who preach on street corners and are even poorer than church mice. Nephew to the wealthy owner of a factory who feels guilty for his brother who was left out of the father's will and gives him a chance, but does not really welcome him to the family. Clyde wants, wants, wants.The true villain of the piece isn't so much Clyde - though he does do bad things - but American society. There is no aristocracy, but we are still not a classless society. He wants to better himself, he wants finer things, but because of his upbringing he is at a disadvantage.He is not lazy. He is a hard worker. He does try. But his desire for more is what gets him in the end.I loved this book. I can see myself re-reading it in the future.
