Here's what I liked about this book:1. I found Christopher, with all his many quirks, to be sweet and rather endearing.2. I thought it was a creative idea to write a book from the point of view of a boy with Asperger syndrome. This is difficult to pull off, but the author does it well.3. I enjoyed Christopher's musings about life and the way in which he sees it.4. I love making lists.Here's what I didn't like about this book:1. It wasn't really a mystery and I found some of it to be a bit predictable (I guessed who killed Wellington long before it was revealed).2. The first half is better than the second half.3. As much as I love making lists (see above), the list thing got the slightest bit annoying after awhile.Overall, a poignant story about a young, brave autistic boy trying to make sense of and find his place in this very complicated world. Worth the read.
