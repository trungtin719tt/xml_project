This is a magnificent play about what happens when hysteria takes over a society, and evil people gain access to the levers of power; something, alas, which happens all too frequently.The focus of the story is John Proctor's struggle to redeem himself from the horrible guilt he has suffered since committing adultery with Abigail. This is indeed very moving. But, for some reason, the part I think of most often is a detail concerning one of the minor characters, Giles Corey, who dies offstage halfway through. Giles is one of many citizens falsely accused of witchcraft by Abigail and those who are exploiting her. He is an impossible situation; irrespective of whether he pleads guilty or innocent, he is doomed. But Giles has a long history of litigation, and knows the law very well. He simply refuses to enter any plea at all.They fetch huge stones, and lay them on top of him, to force him to say something. But the only words he ever utters are "More weight". And so he dies uncompromised, and his farm is inherited by his children. The person telling the story finishes, and adds, "It was a fearsome man, Giles Corey"._______________________________________I just looked it up on Wikipedia; apparently it's all true.The articleis very good.
