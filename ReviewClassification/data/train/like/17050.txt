The first Sherlock Holmes and Doctor John Watson novel, Arthur Conan Doyle's A Study in Scarlet is just lots of fun! The scenes, especially in part 1 are ones we've seen interpreted in shows like BBC's Sherlock, but it's definitely enjoyable to read about (as well as watch) how it all started. In my mind, this book is most compelling for bringing Holmes and Watson together (and for making Watson the chronicler and foil of Holmes' amazing deductions). Doyle makes Holmes every bit as interesting as the cases he solves (probably a reason for his continued success). Holmes isn't motivated by some moral duty to find the bad guy. For him, crimes are puzzles for his intellect, a way to combat boredom. (This is something we've seen in earlier detectives like Edgar Allan Poe's Dupin). While the first part here has the traditional London backdrop, the second part is a flashback which transports us to a frontier Utah. These seemingly disparate sections work well together and make for a compelling story. 4.5 stars.
