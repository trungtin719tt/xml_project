As a storyteller, Benioff's got the complete package: mastery of setting, pacing, plotting, psychology, and especially dialogue. Here, inspired by his Russian grandfather's murky experiences during the siege of Leningrad during World War II, he creates a captivating story of adventure, hope, survival, and humor in a tautly effective short novel.The brutal siege setting is quickly established in the opening chapter, and when the corpse of a German pilot lands near his apartment, teenage Lev Beniov and his friends quickly rush out to scavenge whatever food they can from the body. By the end of the chapter he's been caught as a "looter," and thrown in the notorious Crosses prison, where his cellmate is Kolya, a talkative and jovial army deserter only a few years his senior. Expecting to be executed the next day, they are given an unexpected reprieve by an NKVD officer, who sends them on an absurdist quest for a dozen eggs.This takes them across the city, where they encounter people even more desperate than themselves, and rather more dangerous. Eventually, it takes them out of the city into the German-occupied countryside, where they get embroiled with a band of partisans intent on killing the commander of an Einsatzgruppen. As the duo wanders through the scary and slightly surreal winter landscape, they form a classic odd-couple bond. Lev is the uptight, awkward straight man to Kolya's charismatic, charming rogue.
