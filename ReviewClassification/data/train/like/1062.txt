Of all the books I read my kids, and there are many, this is my favourite to perform.It is so easy to turnWhere the Wild Things Areinto a a big, rollicking tickle fest, and I am never able to resist the urge. When those Wild Things show up with their "terrible roars" and "terrible eyes" and "terrible claws," I attack my kids with everything I've got until they are reduced to quivering masses of giggled out jelly.And Max, the King of the Wild Things, is one of the coolest kids in any kids book ever. Sure he's being too much of a "Wild Thing," which gets him sent to bed, but he's not your modern kid. There's no brattiness and entitlement. Just a cool kid getting a little crazy on fun before being sent off to bed and a great adventure in his dreams.And when he comes back from his adventure he finds his dinner waiting for him...and it's still hot.Super cool fun for you and your kids.
