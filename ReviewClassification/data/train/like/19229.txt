This book raises dullness of style to sublimely convoluted heights. It's really one of the oddest books, stylistically, I've ever read. I read it years ago and I still can't pinpoint the source of this oddness, though I suspect it's the sheer complex awkwardness of the prose, which reminded me of something Henry James might've written if forced to type into a BlackBerry with his elbows.
