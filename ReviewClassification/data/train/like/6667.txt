I'm not sure what to say aboutThe Eye of the World. I first read it way back in 1998 and enjoyed it well enough. I'm pretty happy to be able to say that, unlike a lot of old favourites, this story has stood the test of time. I think I might even have enjoyed this 2016 reread of Eye of the World more than I enjoyed my original read.In many ways this is a very traditional epic fantasy of good vs evil and farmboys that are destined to grow into great heroes and save the world. The saving grace for WoT and the thing that separates it from a ton of other books with the exact same premise is Jordan's engaging writing and his exceptional world building. The characters have their moments, but most are likeable and the cast is suitably large enough to give the story that epic feel to it.I think the WoT books are worthy of being considered modern fantasy greats.Rating: 5 stars.Audio Note: The ever dependable Michael Kramer did an excellent job with the male POV's, and Kate Reading was solid as ever when called upon for the female POV scenes.
