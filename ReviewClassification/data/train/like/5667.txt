Just had this quirk of making a note of a few words from the book. So here it goes-Blue gums, Miss Fancy, Naughty Bird, Hogs, Catfish, Blue jays, Whistle Stop, Alabama, Pink Cadillac, Boots, Opal, Dumplings, Fried chicken, Willie Boy, Blue Polka, Flower girl, Dill Pickle Club.Now as much as I loved this book, there are a few things that struck me as peculiar. The understated homosexuality of the lead pair; how could it be so readily accepted by the townspeople? Fannie Flagg never describes it in the sexual context. Apart from the first few romantic interchanges, there are not much detailed descriptions of any personal/romantic communication between Ruth and Idgie. Well without any certainty I can say that this understatement of homosexuality and ambiguity serves a purpose in the way our reading of the book is directed. The relationship seems to spill copiously both in the spheres of a genuine asexual female friendship and a beautiful romantic bond between the two women. Neither can one place it just in the one and not in the other. It is beautiful in both ways and so does it illuminate the prospect and possibilities of bonding between women. How much can they change each other and themselves for the better with greater self-esteem and self-identification. I would consider this book one of the most enjoyable reads ever. A southern kind of story, it is beautiful, warm, and humourous. Makes me yearn for places I have never been, and for a moment in history I can never live.
