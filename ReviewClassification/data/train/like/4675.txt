I was very sad that Stephenie put this on hold indefinitely, but I can understand why she did. What a violation as an author.I really liked this version. I think I liked being in Edward's head a whole lot more than being in Bella's. Plus, you get the added bonus of being in everyone else's head and get to see their true selves. What fun! I personally thought this book had the potential to be the best of the series. Although I did feel like I was stepping back in time after reading all the other books, it was nice to get a few more details.
