COMPLETELY SPOILER-FREE REVIEW:First thing first, meet Kaz Brekker's crew:5 REASONS WHY CROOKED KINGDOM IS THE BEST SEQUEL EVER#1 Storytelling at its bestThis book will literally keep you on the edge of your seat, your toes curling and your heart racing. There was not a single boring moment. On contrary! I flew through this book and wish it was even longer than 546 pages.#2 Parade of twistsLeigh Bardugo is a genius. I can't even count how many times during this book I thought "No way! I didn't see this coming". The level of awesomeness of twists was beyond this world amazing.#3 Leigh Bardugo = Queen of bantersSeriously, if I wasn't nervously biting my nails waiting for outcome of this or that situation, I was smiling like lunatic whenever these precious characters were bantering among each other. And believe me, it was quite often.#4 All the feelsIf someone told me month ago that Crooked Kingdom was going to make me cry (multiple times), I wouldn't believe it. But it happened. Mrs. Bardugo brought out big guns = raw emotions. And I loved it! (even though my heart broke couple of times)#5 Simply perfectCrooked Kingdom has all qualities that make it outstanding and unforgettable novel. I just have nothing to complain about. Story was addictive, all main characters grew on me big time, ending was realistic and there was even cameo of my favorite character from Grisha trilogy. Now all I can do is re-read it to find all those details that I missed when I read it for the first time and hope that this is not the last novel by Leigh Bardugo set in Grisha world.MORE REVIEWS ON MY BLOGReading Is My BreathingPRE-REVIEW:"No mourners.
