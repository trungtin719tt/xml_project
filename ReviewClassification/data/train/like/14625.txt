Nicholas Sparks: the author who never disappoints.Once again I was blown away by a book written by Sparks. It was so intense, so pure and the ending was a great surprise for me. Books like this one change the way people think.It was so perfect... in all the ways possible. I don't know why I didn't read this book sooner.I don't have words to describe what this book made me feel. But peace, tranquility, love and special seem to be the suitable words.
