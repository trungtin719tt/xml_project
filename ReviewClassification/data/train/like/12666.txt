The first time I read this book--for my 11th grade English class--I read it in one afternoon, and I can honestly say that it changed my life. The second time around was just as powerful for me.Like many others have commented, the genius in Chaim Potok's writing is his remarkable ability to drive a book forward with virtually no plot. Asher Lev doesn't do a lot of things aside from paint and worship for years, but the real story is his internal struggle and his battle with his feelings--it's pretty impressive to write 300 pages of feelings and internal dialogue and turn it into a page-turner.My Name is Asher Lev changed my life because it helped me understand how important it is to discover yourself. It helped me see the world in a brand new way, where passion and duty can sometimes horribly collide. And this is the very first book I read where I applied these principles to my own life and discovered the power that lies in literature not only to provide an escape from reality but also to provide guidance and light as I work to confront it and thrive.
