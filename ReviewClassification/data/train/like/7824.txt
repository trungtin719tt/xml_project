OMG I HEARD THEY'RE MAKING A MOVIE WHAT THE FRICK!!!Are you one of the people who are obsessed with antiheroes? (Like me lol)Ahhh, hi, nice to meet you. I think I've found the perfect book/series for you!This is a book about an evil, millionaire mastermind kid called Artemis. He's honestly evil and ruthless and a total bastard and I LOVE it. This series also has magic and a super cool, badass LEPrechaun called Holly. Freaking fabulous! (And it just gets better with each book!)
