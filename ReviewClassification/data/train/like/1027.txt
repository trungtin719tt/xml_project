For some reason, I've delayed reading this book for many years. Actually, I started it a few times but couldn't get past the language-the use of the n-word and the dialect. This time I stuck it out and I'm so glad I did.Huck Finn is a combination boy's adventure story and biting social critique. Huck is an abused child who runs away with Jim, a slave. The outline of the story is probably known to everyone but the writing is vivid and the anxiety about Jim's getting to freedom intense. And Huck is struggling hard with his ideas of what it means to be good, which would be turning a runaway slave in, and his own conscience, that tells him Jim is a good human being and a loyal friend that he needs to help.Once I got the rhythm of the book, I was able to enjoy the writing. Twain creates scenes so real you can almost see them. There are comic interludes, as when they pick up two con artists who get themselves into deeper and deeper trouble while trying to hoodwink others. The humor is mixed with drama and all along there's commentary on how cruel people can be. Poor Huck thinks he's a hopeless case but it becomes clear he's a very decent human being who is an outcast, like Jim.There's a good reason this book is a classic of American literature and I'm glad to have finally read it.
