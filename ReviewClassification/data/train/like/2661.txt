Re-read #?: November 27-28, 2014Re-read #??: November 29-December 3, 2016While this is probably one of my least favorites of the series, it's still afantasticbook. I can't say for sure why I don't love it as much as the others, but it's just never stood out to me.However, upon rereading it, I am reminded again how great Rowling is at developing a story arc! There are so many hints to later parts of the series in this book! Especially with Tom Riddle showing up, the diary, hints of Ron's affection for Hermione, and overall just building up the characters and storyline. It's also really fun to see things of importance show up early in the story come into significance later on.Here are some thoughts on things I noticed or didn't remember about this book while I was reading it:-Like in one of the Harry Potter video games, Ron and Harry de-gnome the Burrow's garden at the beginning of the book.-Hermione's parents actually go to Diagon Alley and exchange Muggle money at Gringott's!-Why wasn't Nearly Headless Nick's deathday party in the movie? Also he died in 1492 which is when Columbus 'discovered' America. Significant?-"And some old witch in Bath had a book that you could never stop reading! You just had to wander around with your nose in it, trying to do everything one-handed." (p.231) Sounds familiar.-I really wish they had the Valentine's Day party in the movie, with all the dwarves walking around dressed as cupids and delivering love messages.-Aragog is literally my biggest fear.-Apparently Dumbledore, back in the day, was a Transfiguration professor at Hogwarts.-And finally, I knew Voldemort was an heir of Slytherin, duh, but I didn't realize he was thelastheir of Slytherin. Dun dun duuuun.5/5 starsbecause even when it's my least favorite of the seven, it's still perfect.
