Matilda is a little girl who is far too good to be true. At the age of five-and-a-half she's knocking off double digit multiplication problems and blitz-reading Dickens.Matilda Wormwood is often I'll-treated by her parents and older brother, Michael. She retaliates by playing pranks on them. When she goes to school, it's just as bad as the school principal is twice as bad as her parents. Her class teacher, Miss Honey, is the only person Matilda believes in.This is a fun read. Roald Dhal is a fantastic author. I loved this book. A heart-warming tale of a girl living a tough life and finding a way to get through it. A book kids will love to either read by themselves or to be read to. Adults will enjoy this book as well.I would like to thank NetGalley, Penguin Random House UK, Children's and the author Roald Dahl for my ARC in exchange for an honest review.
