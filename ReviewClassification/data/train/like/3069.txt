The third book of the vampire academy series left all of us hanging. All of us wanting more. &amp; all of us with the same question, what happened to dimitri?! Blood promise is everything i could have hoped for. It made me cry. And laugh. And sometimes both. It threw our hope away, then brought it back at the last moment. It was truly a great book. Rose meets her father, unknowingly at first. We actually see emotion from her mother. We see Adrians true dedication to rose, and how much he honestly cares. The story also included a few flash backs with Dimitri that were not in any of the other books. In this last book, rose definetly became more mature. She made heartbreaking decisions. &amp; blood promise, like shadow kissed, left us with a major cliff hanger...But hope still hangs on a thread. I absoluletly loved this book. Richelle Mead is truly an amazing writer. She managed to make this book perfect, and it was never corny. The only part i regret, is that her fifth book, spirit bound won't be out until May 18 2010. I CAN'T WAIT!!!There is suppose to be one other book after spirit bound and possibly a spin off( i read on her site). I would defienely recomend reading blood promise. But of course if you read the 4th book, you can't wait to read this book.
