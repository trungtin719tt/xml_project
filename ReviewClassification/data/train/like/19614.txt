It's a great fantasy: Let's run away to Venice, and hide out in an old movie theater. We can dye our hair blonde, so no one will ever find us!In a way, this is a European version ofFrom the Mixed-Up Files of Mrs. Basil E. Frankweiler, with siblings running away to a place stuffed with antiquities, and getting mixed up in an art mystery. I guess Victor the detective must have the Mrs. Frankweiler role.I didn't expect the touch of fantasy at the end. I'd love to read a sequel to find out what happened to the Thief Lord.
