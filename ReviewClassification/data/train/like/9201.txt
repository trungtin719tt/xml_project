The second book I ever read to my daughter, and the first (and one of the only) non-rhyming books she enjoyed.It's a book of traveling and education, meeting others that are different from you. Baby bird, as they're known to do, falls from the nest and wanders aimlessly for the mother it has yet to meet. Dog, cow, chicken, backhoe, baby bird can't find its mother until kismet allows the benevolent backhoe to replace it back into its nest and mother bird comes flying back in the nick of time! Wait, no, scratch that. She was horribly late. Tons of danger narrowly avoided.Like most Disney movies, the father figure is curiously absent here. I don't know how this particular bird species mates, if it's life-long or more of a no-strings-attached sort of thing, but daddy bird should of been watching baby bird. Or mother bird should have called her sister bird or babysitter bird. Because this whole situation definitely warrants a call to Child Protective Services and could have been avoided. Fortunately luck is on baby bird's side. Read this book to see just how lucky it is!
