Book releases: Hunger Games 2008, Catching Fire 2009, Mockingjay 2010Movie releases: Hunger Games 2012, Catching Fire 2013, Mockingjay, part 1 in 2014 and Mockingjay part 2 in 2015I wanted to sit down and figure out the math of it and I figure 7 years. Between books and movies, I have about 7 years of my life invested into The Hunger Games.I picked up the first book the year it was released in 2008. I had been on a kick where, after diving into the Twilight series (don't judge me, ok you can judge a little)I was not quite sure how to transverse myself in this new world of YA I had recently discovered. So, I was following Stephanie Meyer (tree of trust here) on her blog and she would give recommendations of books she was currently reading. She basically gave Hunger Games a drop everything and read this, read this now shoutout. So, being the lemming I was, I did.And my life was never the same.These books really rekindled my love for reading and the anticipation of waiting a year between releases, I think, really trapped me in this new fangirl universe.Not since Harry Potter, which I first read as an adult-in my early twenties, had I been so enamored in a book world. My realities blurring in that fantastical way only true readers understand.I was hooked, so before each new release, I of course would reread all books out to date.Before Catching Fire's release in 2009, I reread Hunger. Then before Mockingjay's release in 2010, I reread Hunger and Catching Fire. Then of course, when the movies were released, the rereads again commenced.Well at least for movie 1, Hunger Games, release in 2012 and movie 2, Catching Fire release in 2013. That would be two more rereads of all three books.Seeing the pattern here?Now, I did not reread before the Mockinjay movie releases, part 1 in 2014 and tonight's release of Mockingjay part 2 in 2015. The reason behind this being some events in my life in 2014 to now that simply altered my...well, my everything. But that's another post for another time.So, if my math is correct, from 2008 to 2015, then 7 years. 7 years I have invested and I'm not sure what this says or means for me now, other than my evenings meanderings.And I share because I know my fellow bibliophiles have read this in its entirety and understand.So, happy reading. Who knows, maybe that next book you pick up might be the next 7 years of your life.
