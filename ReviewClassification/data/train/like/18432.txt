5 I Should Have Read This Sooner StarsSo, I started this book 4 days ago and now I'm already reading book 4 so you can guess that I loved this, the book and the series so far.The first book was great. It had everything, a kick-ass heroine with a bad past, a powerful, slightly shady and richer than Midas hero, a great mystery and a serial killer, all that set in a futuristic world which was surprisingly well thought and realistic for a book written 20 years ago when even cell phones were a rarity. Also, despite the Sci-fi setting JD Robb does not make the mistake of overwhelming the reader with too much information about the discoveries and changes over the years. The world-building is smooth, with just enough details for the reader to coprehend what everything that's mentioned is but not enough to get fed up with info.The mystery aspect of the novel was quite good. I had a new suspect every few pages, and still managed to be surprised when I found out who it was. I also loved how the author managed to write a book who was basically full of investigative work and not make it boring. To be honest, I've gotten used to UF where you have plenty of fights and magic to make the book more interesting so I wasn't sure if a good old suspense would do the trick. No fear there anymore.My one tiny objection was on the romance side. Although I do love Roarke and Eve together, I thought the romance progressed way too fast. The series already has 40 books and no end in sight, so it could afford to prolong the "falling in love" a little. A little more tension and reluctance would have made it more believable and less mushy. Still, that wasn't enough to make me reduce the rating.******************************************************This book comes highly recommended from plenty of friends and my only GR friend who didn't like it wasdaddy, which really is more of a recommendation than anything else*bats eyes innocently*, so...book you better be good!
