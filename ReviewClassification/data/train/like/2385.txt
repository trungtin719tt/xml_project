Reread Feb 2019No matter how many times I read this book, its effect on me remains the same. Heart breaking and heart warming in equal measure."Holding anger is a poison. It eats you from inside. We think that hating is a weapon that attacks the person who harmed us. But hatred is a curved blade. And the harm we do, we do to ourselves."****************************************Original reviewThis book led Mitch Albom to become one of my favourite authors.It's such a wonderful idea, that when you die you are approached by 5 people you may or may not know who had some kind of impact in your life.The example used is Eddie, an old man who has lived in the same town his entire life, working as a handyman on the local pier/fairground, before his abrupt death.An original premise in itself, I loved following the different people Eddie spoke to and finding out their connection to him.At times heartbreaking and saddening, this story touched me and I strongly recommend it to basically anyone who likes something a bit different but is looking for a relatively quick read.
