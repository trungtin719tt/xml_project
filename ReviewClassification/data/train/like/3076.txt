4.5/5This book was really good! I'm still trying to get over the major twist at the ending which I was kind of expecting but I didn't know that it would be that big.The one thing that I didn't like with this book was that Lissa was kind of "whiny." In Rose's views from her eyes, we were able to see what was going on back at St. Vladimir Academy. I was excited to read this since it might had some more action, which it did, but it wasn't enough to out way Lissa. At the end of the 3rd book, I was disappointed in Lissa and it got even worse in this book. She did get better toward the end which was good.Another thing I didn't like was about Christian and his relationship with Lissa. I know that Lissa was changing because of the magic, but still. Give her a break and work through it. I thought that he was being a little dramatic.Rose is still my favorite character, especially since she is going through many hardships and emotional and physical turmoil. I can't wait to see how she is in the next book.There were many sad parts in this book and I had to look away to calm myself so I wouldn't start crying. I was really upset about Dmitri since I liked him and that ending! I hope that he's going to be alright.There was a cliffhanger at the end of Blood Promise but it was a good kind because come on, what else is the 5th book going to be about?I'm about to find out and I'm very happy to.
