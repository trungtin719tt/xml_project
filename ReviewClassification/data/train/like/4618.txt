It simply doesn't get better than this for playful artistry. Calvin dances between cutting satire and existential crisis while dealing with his primitive imaginary tiger, Hobbes. He creates a character of himself constantly, reinterpreting what happens around him in the context of interstellar adventures, prehistoric capers, and simple reflections as he rides a sled down a snowy hill.If you want an easy yet educational read, or if you want your child to be able to learn lots of new words without dealing with too much "adult content," this book is a perfect fit for you. Bill Watterson created a masterpiece of this, and it's influence on me cannot be understated.
