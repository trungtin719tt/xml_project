I don't understand the one star reviews for the book. Are these directed to the author, Mitch Albom, because he openly dissed the Harry Potter phenomena viaa 594-word short story? Because as far as I can tell,The Five People You Meet in Heavenis a decent piece of literature that doesn't deserve the harsh punishment (presumably) directed to its writer. It's well-written, has a handful of good quotes, and is overall an inspiring and personal take on one's idea of the moment between death and the afterlife. I rather enjoyed it. Mitch Albom has a gift of words, and to give a biased rating is to behave no better than the author itself - to dislike something not based on its own merits, but because of its reputation. I have equal love for the Harry Potter books and forThe Five People You Meet in Heaven, and am proud to say neither HP's popularity nor Albom's notoriety had a say in how I felt for them.I highly recommend this book, particularly if you're one into bittersweet life lessons and notions of death. Some have accused the book for being both preachy and boring, but I don't find that the case.
