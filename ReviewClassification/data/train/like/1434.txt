All the reading she had done had given her a view of life that they had never seen.This book was so heartwarming. And it just proved that Dahl was (and always will be) one of the best storytellers ever. The way he writes and how he draws you into the story will always amaze me. This is my second book of his, but it definitely won't be my last.Amazing book, that I think everybody should read, at least once.
