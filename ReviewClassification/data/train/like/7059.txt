Don't gobblefunk around with words.Thisentire bookwas a gobblefunk of words. Snapperwhippers and babblement and crockadowndillies. My inner grumpy adult came out about 1/2 way through the book -just say what you mean!Meanings is not important, said the BFG. I cannot be right all the time. Quite often I is left instead of right.Yes, yes you were, Mr. BFG - you went left the entire book.Sophie, a little "human bean," gets up one night and spies from her window, a longspindly shape creeping around in the dark.Much to her horror, a real-life giant bounds up to her window and snatches her. He whisks her away to giant country where she learns that every night, giants stealhumans for their dinnerand would eat her in a heartbeat.Luckily, Sophie is stolen by the Big Friendly Giant (BFG) who truly is good, and kind, despite his propensity for murdering the English language. He would rather eat disgusting snozzcumbers than human beans and does his best to give children happy dreams. Sophie insists that the other giantsmust be stoppedand quickly hatches a plan with the BFG - but the real question is,will the queen of England believe them?English aside, this was a very cute story. Sophie manages to be heroic without being precocious and the BFG's earnestness really cinched the plot.Audiobook CommentsI listened to the enhanced audio - which came equipped with sound effects and great characterizations. If you have a hard time with the grammatical errors and deliberate misspellings, listening to the book makes it much better.The 2018 Pop Sugar Reading Challenge - A childhood classic you never readBlog|Instagram|Twitter
