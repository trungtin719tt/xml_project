my mom kept bugging me to read an author by the name of Francine Rivers and i kept putting her off. Then one day i was about 5 months pregnant and bored, so i picked up the first book in the Mark of the Lions trilogy and read the first sentence. These are not thin books but suffice it to say, i finished all three in about 4 days. and i have read them several times since. all of her books are powerful in different ways, but these three and Redeeming Love have affected me and the way i approach my faith deeply.
