Absolutely wonderful. I'm saying that right at the beginning.I love this Dan Brown book so much to the point offangirling. I think this is Mr. Brown at his best and perhaps his more underrated books out of everything he's published so far. I also have no idea why it's not being made into series. Perhaps that's a good thing because too much of a good thing can make the magic disappear, but I think I could live with one or two more Michael Tolland book.I give props for the shocking twist at the end. I did not see it coming. For sheer entertainment value, this book has it all. To be quiet honest, I didn't mind so much the issues the book discusse or did I particularly care about the degree of truthfulness that the "conspiracy theories" this book provided. As with all Dan Brown stories, suspension of disbeliefisstill required to read it but, the heck with that! It was so much fun to read, what with the gripping action that ran throughout the whole story.Actually this book had me at "NASA". (Apparently, I'm that much of a geek.) But then Rachel Sexton and Michael Tolland are such compelling characters as well. I was rooting for the both of them since page 1 and I wanted them not only to come out of this ordeal alive, but to have a happy ending. I was even in support of the romance that sparked between them, although I usually ignore the more lovey dovey parts in this genre. In this book, however, I thought their romance made sense.Simply put, best Dan Brown book so far. A genuine page-turner.Also: why is it not being made into a movie?
