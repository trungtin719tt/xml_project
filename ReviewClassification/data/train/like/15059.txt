"I ain't nobody's little nigger!"The above sentence was hurled in anger by Cassie Logan, a young girl growing up with her strong, loving family in Mississippi at the height of the Depression. It wasn't the first time I cheered aloud for her spirit and bravery, and it wasn't the last. The Logan family may seem to be at the mercy of the local white folks, but they're not going down without a fight.Her mother attempts to explain to Cassie the facts:"How come Mr. Simms went and pushed me like he did?"Mama's eyes looked deeply into mine, locked into them, and she said in a tight clear voice, "Because he thinks Lillian Jean is better than you are, Cassie . . ."When Cassie wonders if Mr. Simms thinks Lillian Jean is better because she is his daughter, Mama's answer stuns her:"No, baby, because she's white."Her father explains things a little differently:"There are things you can't back down on, things you gotta take a stand on. But it's up to you to decided what them things are. You have to demand respect in this world, ain't nobody just gonna hand it to you. How you carry yourself, what you stand for - that's how you gain respect. But, little one, ain't nobody's respect worth more than your own."The recorded version I listened to offers a powerful afterward by Taylor, whose great-grandfather was born a slave."Racism still exists,"she proclaims, before going on to decry attempts to"whitewash history"by banning books that may be"too painful"or use the"n-word."Thereisplenty of violence and terror in this book, but it's a compelling story that NEEDS to be read, and a lesson that needs to be repeated again and again.As Cassie's wise mother states,"Everybody born on this earth is something and nobody, no matter what color, is better than anybody else."
