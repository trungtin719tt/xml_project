What is the first thing we ask when a child is born? - GENDERThe six-letter word, not the three-letter word "sex" of the child - because gender involves our perception of what the child will be, our expectations of what roles the child will perform in the future - the life of the child is determined right away when we ask this question. AsJudith Butlerputs it,Gender is Performance.But imagine a world where genders can be changed at will - an androgynous world where humans remain in neuter gender for most days of the lunar cycle, enter a phase of sexual activity, orkemmerfor a few days during which one of them becomes female and the other male, and at the end of the cycle, become neuters again.What are their roles in society? How are they identified in terms of social hierarchy?Genly Ai, a man (like us Earthlings) from Ekumen, descends on another planet Gethen, which is in the Ice Age, and where androgynous people dwell, with their own curious lives as both men and women, and as neither. The beauty of this novel lies there - in how it questions our taken-for-granted ideas of gender and gender performance, family, relationships, marriage and parenthood through the eyes of Ai, who finds himself perpetually perturbed by not being able to place the new people in a conventional framework of gender, and finds himself appalled at seeing in them both a feminity and masculinity, which to him, cannot co-exist in a single person.Estraven, the other major character of the story serves as the object of study for him, and as Estraven struggles to help Ai with his mission on this planet,(view spoiler)[and eventually sacrifices his life for Ai(hide spoiler)], Ai realizes that he need not look at them as either Male or Female - he had to see them for what they were -Humans.More than anything, the novel gently teases our subconsciously ingrained impulses to seek the gender of the people we meet in order to decide on our behavior with them - in order to judge them by their genders, in order to know what to expect from them, without knowing it, and in fact, denying it all the time that we do such a thing.We see ourselves, along with Ai, reluctant to let go our notions of an essential duality - that of yin and yang, good and evil, light and darkness, left and right, in the world of Gethen that knows of no such distinctions, that is awholein itself, rather than being a whole made up of two complementing opposites. Essentially, the novel breaks our prejudices of seeing a person as a man or as a woman - instead, with Ai, we learn to see a person as Human, and love them as such - with a bond that transcends the myth of man-man or girl-girl friendships made even more tangible by our highly publicized movies on bromances or womances.Coming to the technical part, yes, the story was slow, but then, this is ideological SF, soft-SF that tends to play with ideas, and where the plot takes a backseat. This book is not intended for people who cannot imagine SF without moments of thrill. SF is a setting here, rather than the main thing itself.The language is immensely, beautifully poetic, lyrical and charming - the captivating little poem provides the title of the book -the left hand of darkness is(view spoiler)[light(hide spoiler)]- reading the work is a sheer delight, and in the chapters detailing Estraven and Ai travelling 72 days on the Ice, the language is almost elevated to the level of a classic, which is a rare, rare thing in SF.Reading this novel is like reading lucid, delicate poetry at its best.There is a beautiful interplay of concepts that resonate through the work - the concept of light and darkness, sitting apt within the plot since the setting is Ice Age - like an echo, rebounds at us everywhere we look - the blinding light, the blinding darkness.The world-building, especially for an ideological SF work where the emphasis is on ideas, rather than setting and plot, is not only remarkable, but outstanding. It repeatedly seemed to me I was reading Mieville, but abridged - Le Guin has gone to extraordinary lengths to make the world believable - the extraordinary number of legends and myths invented, apart from the radically different psychology of a world that does not know of gender imprisonments, and therefore, has different concepts of virility, shame, betrayal and faithfulness is a mammoth feat. And yet, the world of Gethen seems just as real as that of Earth.For the slow start, slow pace and almost non-existent plot, I had considered rating it somewhere between 3 and 4 stars. But in retrospect, thinking of the massive ideological impact it makes on our gendered thinking, I cannot help but rate it higher.It is not just a path-breaking, radical work - it is a means to introspect our own prejudices through fiction, which is one of the main aims of good literature. For that, it is a landmark work.
