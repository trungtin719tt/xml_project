The Zombie Room by R D RonaldHave read other works by the author and enjoyed them so happy to learn of this new one, description leaves me with many questions...Won't go into details of the story but my impressions: found language a bit on the rough side but it goes with the story line.Wanted to hear more from the prison side of things-something I will never get to experience myself-Find it fascinating, the bond and achievements you can make while on the inside.When the men get involved with helping others in the sex traffic ring they got their work cut out for them. Details are just so specific and well thought out where you can picture it happening in your mind.Horrific scenes of torture I can't even imagine in my wildest thoughts-they don't even appear to be considered human to me.Loved hearing about the technology used in this book from many different angles to think of what the devices could do good things in our society.Terrifying minutes that linger took me a long time to move on to the rest of the story. Liked the ending but wanted more from this tale.Ends with an excerpt from The Elephant Tree by the author which I loved.Received this review copy from the author via the publisher and this is my honest opinion.
