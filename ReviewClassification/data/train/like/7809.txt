99c Kindle sale, Oct. 11, 2018.A solid, amusing start to this YA fantasy series, about a twelve-year-old millionaire evil genius. Okay, he's not really evil, but heisinto criminal heists, especially since the family wealth is gone, his father has disappeared, and his mother is mentally ill, out of touch with reality. So Artemis, having used his brilliant mind to figure out that fairies are real, decides to restore the family fortune by kidnapping a fairy and holding him or her for for ransom. Fairy gold, that's the ticket!Now Artemis and his assistants are up against the military and police forces of faerie. The resulting conflicts are both funny and tension-filled. It's kind of likeMission: Impossiblewith a magical element and a hidden society of magical folk.Recommended! I've read the first four books (got them in a paperback set) and enjoyed all of them.
