A delightful classic!Mole, Badger and Rat (Ratty) are friends of the infamous Toad of Toad Hall. While his friends live the simple country life, Toad lives the life of a millionaire Playboy. one day while taking his friends for a ride in his carriage an automobile spooks the horse and overturns the carriage. Toad then gets a wild hair that he must have an automobile at all costs. Can toads friends save him from his very self before it's too late?This is a great little story that helps tell children not just a tall tale filled with animals but helps them distinguish moral values and presents friendship from several different points of view. The characters are different but mesh so well that most anyone can identify with at least one of them. The story, although not long, is beautifully written in lush detail. Perfect for young readers who are just beginning to learn to read big books.The actual book story is a bit different from the Disney version of Mr. Toad, but they definitely have their similarities. If I remember correctly the underlying story is very much the same. I do think however, watching the Disney version would be a great compliment to the story after reading the book.My son and I thoroughly enjoyed this book. He loved Rat the best as he was so kind-hearted and gentle and willing to take Mole under his wing in so many undertakings.This is a book I think every child should read at least once. And if you are an adult and have not read it I would highly recommend doing so.
