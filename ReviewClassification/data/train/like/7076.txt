I LOVE the vernacular! Whizzbangers, snozcombers...I've read this out loud to my children any number of times and I getvery, veryinto the voices, so they love it. This time I listened to Natasha Richards read it and she did a beautiful job! Of course she's English so was a natural. No non-English person can "be" the Queen as well as an English person, but leaving that aside, she was perfect!Dahl is a master at weaving these wonderfully empowering tales using nonsense. Not only his situations are nonsense, but so is the vocabulary he uses. Doesn't matter. Children are always the hero and children reading his books feel there must be a hero inside of them as well. That's the beauty of his work.I am a bit hesitant to see the movie because I have very vivid images of Sophie and the BFG in my mind, and have for years, but I just keep telling myself that no movie will take those images away. Here's hoping it won't.
