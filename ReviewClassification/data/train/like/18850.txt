This was a really good read. I am a huge paranormal romance fan, so I am always looking for new and interesting series and "Need" did not disappoint! I thought it had some similarities to "Twilight", which was not a bad thing, since I enjoyed "Twlight"... Zara getting sent off to live with a relative she isn't as familiar with, new school, all new friends, cold, isolated setting in the North, this guy who seems really interested in her but also aloof and distant... but also had enough differences that it was certainly its own story. What I mean to say is, if you liked "Twilight" and are looking for another similar book, this one fits.I really liked the relationship between Zara and her grandmother Betty. Betty is a strong character on her own, and the way they get closer over the course of the book is cool. I also like the friendships that Zara develps with Izzy and Devon. The super natural element was cool, and I look forward to seeing that developed more.Please excuse typos. Entered on screen reader.
