Oh boy. Here's the thing: If you read this novel as a citizen of 2010, a member of our hyper-speed, uber-connected modern society that navel-gazes in 140 word bytes with little interest in true introspection,The Maguswill seem almost comical in its psycho-thrilling, Jungian dribbling plot and Baroque-meets-mod writing style.If you, dear reader, consider thatThe Maguswas partially written nearly 60 years ago (begun in the early 50s, published in '65, revised in '76), its risky political and sexual behavior and twisted plot now seems the apex of modernity of post-war culture. This is David Lynch decades before he wrapped Isabella Rossellini in blue velvet, "White Rabbit" when Grace Slick was in pigtails, free love to a generation stripping off their bobby socks, "Schindler's List" for young people who had vivid memories of World War II and their parents of the Great War.As a read, I found it intoxicating. I was surprised at every turn, and, despite its substantial size, never bored or exhausted. Although I enjoyed it to bits, I couldn't recommend it to any of my GoodReads buddies- I honestly think you'd hate it! That's not a throwing down of the gauntlet, but a genuine Caveat emptor. If you didn't like TheFrench Lieutenant's Women, steer well clear ofThe Magus.Fowles, in his foreward to the 1976 revision, acknowledges the many negative critical reviews received upon its initial publication ("justified criticisms of excess, over-complexity and artificiality..."). But as he reflects on his motivation in writing, he realizes thatThe Magusmust "remain a novel of adolescence, written by a retarded adolescent" and that freedom, one of the central themes of the novel, must be grasped by the writer to create whatever worlds he or she damn well pleases.I celebrate the notion of the latter, as long as the reader is gifted a damn good story. For those of us who suffered through "The Most Dangerous Game" and "The Lottery" in 7th grade English, I offer up the satisfaction ofThe Magus.
