I would never have picked up this book on my own, what with the unfortunate title, but I'm ever so grateful that I found it on my Unitarian Universalist minister's bookshelf. If I were Christian, this would be a 5-star book, so I recommend it to monotheists. This is basically a Sneetches with a Christian spin that had both me and my son sitting in silent contemplation and wonder, flippng through the pages and thinking more deeply about that "mystery which some people call God." It then prompted a meaningful discussion about popularity, poverty, and conformity. Definitely a thought-provoking read with a title that is sure to keep it unpopular for years to come.
