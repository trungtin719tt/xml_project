I'm not a Christian so I had no idea as I began this book what I "ought" to think about it. I read it because of its reviews and I am so glad I did. It probably seems to be all about the Bible and Christianity and religion, but it isn't. It's about the teachings of real mystics, people who have transcended this world we think so important and so real, and causes us so much pain. It's about what Jesus Christ probably really taught, and you won't find much of that in your Bible. But for me, it's about a woman who stood behind Jesus, who taught him and inspired him and knew what he knew, only she understood it better. In this book Mary Magdalene is not his wife or his disciple, though she learns from him as he learns from her, she's a philosopher and a teacher and a fully realized human being. As for the writing, well, I can happily lose myself in Moby Dick and Crime and Punishment and The Magic Mountain so I found the language ravishing. It's the kind of language appropriate to such people, rather like the King James version of the Bible. It was poetry and yet full of real life and humor (MM is funny! and so is Jesus!). Anyone who could give a book that's sure to become a classic one star has to be reflecting their own strongly held religious beliefs, not the quality of this book. This book is art. And it could clear away all those cobwebs and half-truths we struggle with in one read. More than one read will do a lot more than that. Recommend this book? I urge you to read it. It's transforming. Oh, and one other thing, it's a great read. Lots of story and action and surprises.
