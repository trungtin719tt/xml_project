I've readThe Adventures of Huckleberry Finnmany times: first as a teenager, then as a young man in college and until last week, as a thirty-something adult. Each reading brought new insights about Twain's take on the American experience. He created unforgettable and timeless characters, the likes of which still existfrom sea to shining sea.Drifting down the Mississippi River with Huck and Jim is a sublime experience. Twain captures the majesty and serenity of the river and uses it as a powerful metaphor for their troubled lives. Both are fleeing civilization because it represents an intolerable set of rules; Huck's life has been shaped by poverty, cruelty and neglect and Jim is an escaped slave. Huck, though still a boy, is an astute observer and Jim becomes the first and only adult who deserves his respect and loves him unconditionally.Twain published this at the close of Reconstruction and the birth of Jim Crow. For all his minstrel show characteristics, Jim is morally superior to all the scoundrels they encounter, particularly the King and the Duke, two grifters who hijack the raft to save their own necks. In Huck's increasingly radical voice, Twain skewers all kinds of injustices: not just the inhumanity of slavery, but also, false piety and vigilantism. Masquerading as an adventure story, it is a celebration of the glories of the Mississippi, a comic tour de force and a ringing indictment of American malfeasance and hypocrisy. This is arguably the Great American Novel. Just imagine what Twain would have to say about our current state of affairs.2/5/15 Updatehttp://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/05/boo...Updated 3/22/14Becoming Mark Twain:http://www.salon.com/2014/03/22/how_m...
