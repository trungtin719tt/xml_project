2015 Super Favorite!I went into this novel not knowing much about it really, only afraid I wouldn't be able to handle it if it was too sad(being the animal lover than I am)and had already started a great classic play I was eager to get into, but after reading two chapters ofThe Art of Racing in The RainI knew it would be utterly impossible to put it down...and it was.This story is so much more than I thought it would be. It is touching, inspirational, filled with kindness, understanding and just an absolutely unputdownable work of fiction. It makes you think about your pet's life and their thoughts through gestures. It even has twin humanoid villains and an imaginary striped demon...and yes...there is some sadness and despair within these pages, but overall, it is a happy, feel-good amazingly enjoyable book.If this is on your agenda to read, don't wait....read it now. If it's not, add it....you won't be disappointed you did. (IMHO)I actually feel like starting over and reading it again!
