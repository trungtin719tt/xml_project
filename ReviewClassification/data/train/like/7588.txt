It took me a while to finish this book. This book is not for the fainted hearted. I had to wait until I was in the right place to read this. I had read this book about 25 years back when I still was a teenager and I really wanted to know if I would remember it. I didn't remember it, but I loved reading it. When I got sucked in it, I couldn't put it down. I got all kinds of emotions from this book. This is a story so twisted and dark, but you want to know the end. There for 5 points.
