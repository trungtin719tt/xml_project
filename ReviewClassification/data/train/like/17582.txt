I remember "This Present Darkness" with fondness from my early - mid teen years. While some may disdainfully complain that Peretti is nothing but a fantasy writer for Christians and that his works cause the easily influenced to see demons behind every tree, in my opinion he does the church a service by reminding us of the supernatural forces which actually *are* at work in our world and which many of us have done out best to forget in this "modern" era. Do they function exactly as Peretti describes? No, I am certain they don't. This is clearly fiction, and the author would not claim otherwise. And I don't envy the line he has to walk between theology and story telling, fearmongering and faith. Certainly there are going to be some slip-ups, and equally certainly no single group of Christians is going to agree exactly where they are. :) But there are undeniably some good principles behind the action, and a darned good story to boot. I still recommend "This Present Darkness" and its sequel "Piercing the Darkness" to anyone looking for a good read and perhaps an eye-opening glimpse into the spiritual forces beyond our ordinary perception.
