Out of My Mind is offically one of my favorite books. If you are looking for a sad, yet amazing book this is the way to go!!! It is about a girl named Melody who has cerebral paly's and can't walk, talk, or move - except for her fists a little bit, she is in a wheelchair to. In the middle of the book she finally gets a medi-talker so she can program words into it and type words and it will talk for her. Also she has an aide and her name is Catherine. A girl named Claire thinks that Catherine just cheats for Melody on work so she will get good grades. Especially when the are going to take the Whiz Kidz test to see if you get on the team. The teacher says that he will give them a practice round and then the real test will be at a later time. On the practice test you have 30 seconds to answer each question - just like on the real test. Whoever gets the highest score on the practice test gets to have a candy bar, but whoever gets the highest score on the real test gets to be on the team. All the things you get to do on the team is compeete and if your team gets to the finals you get to travel to Washington D.C. Well everbody underestimated Melody, but she was the only one that got an 100 on the test. But all in all, I LOVED this book!
