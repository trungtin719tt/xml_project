5 "cinematic, psychosexual thriller" stars !!6th Favorite Read of 2018This is a book that can be easily dismissed when we are guarded, cynical, fearful or imperious. I started this book at a remote location with very small font that hurt my trifocal vision....and yet....amidst mosquitoes, overheating and copious amounts of food I returned over and over until my vision gave out and I fouind a larger print Anita Brookner to round out my week. I returned to an e-copy on my return.However this book was forever in my imagination and entered my dreams on those sultry nights while I heard the loons calling over the lake. I started by resisting this book and I was guarded, cynical, fearful and imperious towards it just as the protagonist was as he went through a most profound personal transformation from self-absorption to self-awareness.A middle class Englishman (Nicolas Urfe) is without family or prospects. He is handsome and breaks women's hearts particularly Alison a sensual and earthy Aussie. He moves to an island in beautiful Greece to teach at an Academy and becomes embroiled in one of modern lit's most interesting psychodramas headed by a high priest of manipulation Conchis and his acolytes or actors or fellow therapists or clergy. In fact, we never really find out who they are or what they want with our Englishman. He is driven mad by sexual desire by two twin sisters while Alison haunts him from back home. He confuses selfishness with love, desire with necessity, sexuality for spirituality.He is psychologically tortured, manipulated, hurt and reborn by a series of incidents that lure him deeper into Conchis' web. We never find out what is real, what is supernatural, what is hypnosis, what are lies ? As we read our own defenses come down and we are stricken to our core by some psychodynamic magic or perhaps the power of Ancient Greek Gods and Godesses.The book is filled with religious, philosophical, erotic and artistic content and we begin to drown along with our hero into both death and rebirth. The prose is both profound and contrived, both elegant and farcical, both beautiful and obscene. Unless we make peace with dialectics we will never make it out of this labyrinth.A remarkable feat of 1960s ornate psychosexual grandeur !!
