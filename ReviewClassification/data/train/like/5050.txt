A book is always a new meeting, expected, happy or not, but always full of promise. It's mostly an appointment in the order of intimacy with an author. A special bond with his characters and script.Into the wild, this is my meeting with Christopher McCandless. Young man, brilliant, selfless and wise, he decided to get rid of a world become too narrow for him. A urban wildlife, he preferred the open spaces away from hypocrisy, excessive consumption and standards imposed by society. Up to leave his and to give his name, Chris becomes Alexander Supertramp, hermit fascinating and jovial.There are persons with that could have liked to know because we are appreciative of their work or because they embody values that we cherish. Then there are the others ... Those for which we feel a great connivance of printing has taken place specific meeting. Christopher McCandless was and will of these beings whose indelible not flush against the ground. Because he chose to live differently and because his company seemed utopian in the era of planned obsolescence and the race to modernity, his mark will remain forever present.Beyond the epic of a young man enamored of independence and love of life, we discover an amazing personality, a Human being who has profoundly influenced those who crossed his path.

This is a lesson given by a traveler, who, if not escape through dreamed landscapes, continue to live long drives in his footsteps during a few pages.
