As the title suggests, this book is centered around the Suffragette movement, but it's so much more than that. As you read about the thoughts, experiences and feels that the central protagonist Penelope has, you become utterly absorbed.I really loved the accurate historical context of the setting for this book, the rising of the suffragette movement in America. Whilst it may not be a strict stoic feminist read, it is about the exploits of a girl who become a woman, and learns the importance of making choices for herself. You feel the heartache that she goes through, as well as the anger and frustration in terms of how she and the women around her were viewed by the menfolk. But what I really enjoyed was the tenderness in the telling of her story and the subtle intricate details about life back then. An absolutely fantastic read.
