"The World According to Garp" was recommended to me at university by a friend, back in the olden days when there were not even any smart-phones, can you believe it?Anyway, I started reading this masterpiece one sunny day, and by the end of the next sunny day I'd finished it, satisfied in the knowledge that I had just completed a book that deserves the accolade of masterpiece. Did I tell you I like this book?Irving's work is nothing short of genius, and one of my three favourite books ever (the other two areCrime and PunishmentandCatch-22).I love the unconventional when it comes to fiction, and TWATG is certainly that.Funny and sad, optimistic and fatalistic, this work takes you on a magic carpet ride with a cast of some of the most outrageous, lovable and grotesque characters you'll ever encounter in a book.From Garp's stubbornly focused mother, Jenny, to lusty Garp himself, and the show-stealing transgender Roberta Muldoon, these folks leave you breathless as they careen through their roller-coaster lives.Gender roles - such a hot and controversial topic today - was foreshadowed as a big social issue by Irving all those years ago. And sexuality as a theme is also pervasive, which itself has to be interesting to readers, right? And of course, everybody's favourite topic, death, gets plenty of airtime. There are some very unusual sticky ends that score high marks for originality and perverseness.So, do yourself a huge, huge favour, and get a hold of this book. If you haven't seen the movie with Robin Williams in the starring role and John Lithgow giving a superb performance as Roberta Muldoon, watch it. It's also a beauty!
