Add me to what I'm sure is a very short list of people who didn't get the whole "anti-god" sentiment that this series is supposedly laden with.I read this series for the first time several years ago while working in a book store and madly searching for something to tide me over until the next Harry Potter came out. I became a dedicated Pullman fan within a few pages of "The Golden Compass."I like young adult fantasy that doesn't pander and Pullman wouldn't dream of doing that to his readers. He assumes you're smart enough to understand where he's taking you and how you're going to get there and he's smart enough to let you draw your own conclusions.The arc of Lyra "Silvertongue" Belacqua is a wonderful and satisfying one and her story is one of the few really strong ones for young female characters in young adult fantasy fiction. She grows gradually and beautifully through the course of a harrowing but never the less exciting adventure from an almost feral child into a breath taking young woman. Her's is every child's painful journey to adulthood.Pullman's wonderful world is based upon our own and there are strong elements of "steam punk" throughout though he doesn't get bogged down in fancy contraptions and top hats the way others do. His characters are the real story here and they are painted wonderfully and with incredibly detail.Its his daemons that I love the most and every time I pick these books up to read again, and I do often, I spend a considerable amount of time wondering what form my own would take. I also find myself wondering every time how a man who views the soul in such a wonderful way could be called godless.
