I read this book in sixth grade and cried my twelve-year-old heart out. Another book I share with my sixth grade students. What I find is that this book in particular allows the boys in my class to get emotional about a story and be able to talk about it together and normalize it. It is almost a contest for them of who got most upset. One student said he finished it on a plane ride home and that the flight attendant kept coming up to him asking him if he was alright. I've had many students tell me this is the best book they have ever read and I am glad that I get to share it with them each year. I would love to do this as a read aloud but I know I wouldn't be able to get through it. Just the part where Billy meets his dogs for the first time gets me.
