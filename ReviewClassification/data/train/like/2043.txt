Mark Twain, or rather, Samuel Clemens, was a special man. When he wasn't hating everyone generally but loving them individually, he was writing very observant tales that did much more than scratch the surface of hypocrisy, racism, and the gullibility that resides in us all.I'm a fan. A big fan. And the man was very witty. "There is no weather in this book." God. I love this shit.So when I finally get around to re-reading his old stuff like Tom Sawyer, a YA book if I've ever read one, I was certain that I'd be getting a real treat. White-washing was never so fun. Neither was swinging a dead cat over one's head. Or getting involved with MURDER.Jeeze, I read this and I was thinking of Stephen King'sThe Bodyand thinking about The Goonies and thinking about Treasure Island. What do all of these stories have in common with Tom Sawyer?Everything.And I guess I think I like bad-boy Tom better now than when I was younger. Sure, all of these kids are pretty stupid pretty much all the time, but then, weren't we all? :)
