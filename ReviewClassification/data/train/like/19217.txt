This just might be the 15th, 18th or 19th 'top 10' book that I have ever read.He is not French, not one of the old Russians, not Irish nor English. Not German nor Spanish.The man is from Portugal.The winds of Fado embrace this land as it also drapes this material.There is not a neat box to categorize this story.It refuses classification, but we can say 'it is one man's opinion of his life written in the first person.'Welcome to bon motville.Is it the best book ever published? Maybe. Almost biblical.I can only compare it to the New and the Old testaments, the Koran, and others of this ilk that have been read over and over by generation after generation.I have been all around Europe.But what I loved about Lisbon, about Portugal, was its' indifference to its' neighbors.The Portuguese speak and behave without swag, without conceit, without pomp, without attitude.Within the confines of Europe, they are a unique people.They seldom embellish and seem quite comfortable with how and who they are.And if you perceive them as a different sort, unlike you, and more like Icelanders, so be it.Reykjavik has Laxness.But only Portugal has sowed arguably the greatest writer of all time.Fernando Pessoa.(10 stars from the distinguished guy seated in the last row)
