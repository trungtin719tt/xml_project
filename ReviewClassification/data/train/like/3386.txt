Audiobook reread.I read this is 5th grade and the story has stuck with me all of these years. For me its the quintessential book about the innocence of childhood, but also about the moment when you realize you cannot stay in that innocence bubble forever, and how hard that is.I cannot wait to share this story with my kids.
