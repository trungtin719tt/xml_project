This five-star rating is the one I gave Ann-Marie MacDonald's powerhouse first novel the first time around, but I confess I was remembering and rating it at a great distance. I'm going to think on my second rating a bit more, but I can tell you that this was a very different read this time. I don't know that I liked it as much - although I recognize the mastery of its writing and characterization, and the amazing imagination behind the story. And I love how Cape Breton it was. But it was also gruelling and painful; it was long and sloggy at the 2/3rds to 4/5ths mark. And of course, having read it, the big reveal at the end was not the shocker it was on first read.I think I'll land on a high 3, so let's say 4.
