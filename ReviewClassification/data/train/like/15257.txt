I really liked this book. It was a bit slow at the beginning but once I got over that I was completely hooked. We are introduced into a new werewolf world with this series, one that has not been described in any other series I have read so far.Our heroine is Elena. She was just a normal girl who made the mistake of falling in love with her teacher, a young hot and sexy blonde who had her crazy in love since they first met. I mean, what would you have done in Elena's place? I know if I was in her place just the same.But then things got terribly wrong once she got bitten by this wolf. She woke up and immediately realized things were wrong, very wrong. First she is alone with this guy (Jaime) who keeps telling her she has been bitten by Clay (the teacher) and that she is now a werewolf. She doesn't wanna believe this but the evidence is right there in her.The cool thing about this book is that being a werewolf is not nice, it's the worst thing that could have happened to Elena. She just can't control it. Not any other women survived the change, she has been the only one so far and is suffering intolerable pain while being extremely confused trying to analyze things. She just knows she has to escape From this Jaime who keeps telling her that to stay with him and the pack is the best thing she can do so far. But will she listen to him? Or will she leran by the hard way Jaime was right?I'm not gonna say anything else about the plot because I don't wanna spoil it, I just wanted to give you all a pick inside this great and different series. I loved to see Elena struggle to understand everything in this new world and Clay trying to make Elena understand this was the right thing for her. How will he make to get Elena's love back after what he did to her? Well you have to read it to know guys,lol. Enjoy!
