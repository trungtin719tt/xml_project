My first book by this author, which I plan to follow up with his Gulag Archipelago, a classic work on the totalitarian prison system of the Stalinist era. For someone interested in the living conditions of a prisoner in the Gulag, this is a short, clear description - a single day in the life of Ivan, lived as it were any other day of his three thousand five hundred and sixty three days of inprisonment. A good look at the psychology of a victim of terror.
