This book is a classic and there is absolutely nothing I can say that hasn't already been said by countless reviewers. You really can't go wrong with Dr. Seuss, and there's a reason people from all generations are familiar with this book. This book is, put quite simply, just tons of fun to read. It doesn't matter if you are a child or an adult. Almost all of the words are sight words, so it's easy enough to read for beginners. The story is wonderfully silly, and there's a great rhythm to the rhymes that is characteristic of Dr. Seuss' books. I would highly recommend this for children 4 to 8, but it's also great practice for older kids who need help recognizing and learning rhythm in poetry.
