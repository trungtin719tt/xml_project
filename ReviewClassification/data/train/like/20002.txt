This is one of the most psychologically terrifying books I've ever read, and I think that's because of its hyper-realism. I don't know if I'd class this as dystopian. I think I'd class this as a survival tale.And a terrifying one at that.It's a smooth progression from a completely normal situation to a freakish horror scenario. Miranda's world progresses so slowly, so smoothly, that it's hard to even realize how nightmarish her life has become.Don't expect any jump scares, or explicitly scary scenes, yet the whole book isterrifying. The focus is all on showing and not on telling.And Miranda's character arc?Stunning.She grows from a very naive and downright dreamy kid to an incredibly mature kid, and you barely notice. Again, the showing and not telling is the main strength of the book.Honestly, I read this book too long ago to really get everything, but I think you can get anything you want fromthis review.Blog|Goodreads|Twitter|Youtube
