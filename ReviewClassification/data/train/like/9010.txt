Thankfully, I can report that I quite enjoyed this one, and had none of the bumpy ride thatCryptonomicongave me. The casual misogyny was nowhere in sight, thank goodness. Also, at only 400 pages, this was a much tighter story, and better because of that. Stephenson's still packing in a million ideas a minute, but that's okay, I can deal with that. In fact, I quite enjoy that.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
