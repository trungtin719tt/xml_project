I adore this book and wish I could carry my enthusiasm for it to Murakami's other works. But in contrast toWind-Up Bird Chroncle, those I've read disappoint. (Kafka On the Shoredevolved into some wretchedly bad writing after the first half. Or was it wretchedly bad translation? I wish I knew.) Anyway, I have readWind-Up Birdtwice and will read it again. My favorite part is the sequence set during World War II near the Khalkha River in Outer Mongolia. This is Lieutenant Mamiya's tale of a daring special op that goes horribly wrong. Along the way a man is flayed alive in very methodical fashion by a Russian agent. But don't be misled. This is just one of the several fascinating digressions that the story undertakes. It is not a war story by any means, but is set for the most part in booming Tokyo during the 1980s. Hypnotic. Not to be missed!
