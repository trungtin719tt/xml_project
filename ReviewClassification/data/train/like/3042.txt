If pressed to pick one this would be my favorite Dr. Seuss story. I grew up on Suess and enjoy bringing it to a new generation when I substitute teach. I am always surprised by how many kids aren't familiar with the stories but I have yet to meet one that doesn't like them. Their tongue twisting rhymes and nonsensical words are fun for the reader to read out loud as well. I recently took this to a second grade class who enjoyed it. The message of the book is a simple but important one, we must take care of the planet or risk losing it's precious resources. Even though it was written in 1971 it's message still holds up today and it's one I enjoy passing on to the kids I teach.
