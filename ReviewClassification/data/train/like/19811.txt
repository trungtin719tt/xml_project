A great book... can't believe it was written in the 80's! It has all the 'good' ingredients... suspense, mystery, romance... and you never know what will happen next in the book. Amazing twists in the book. This is one of those books that have twists every four lines!Very cleverly written... amazing plot... my favorite part is the Chess thing!And hey... Tracy, the main female character is entirely human... she gets sick once, and even experiences fear and sympathy. Not a typical image of a con artist!All in all, a superbly great read... must-read for those above 16 who like a bit of kick in their books.
