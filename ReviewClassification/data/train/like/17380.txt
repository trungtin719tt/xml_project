I really enjoyed this book! I was captivated and interested from the start which is really important for me. I don't like books that are slow to start and often put them aside after a few chapters if it hasn't grabbed my attention by then.I didn't notice Feist spend any time at the beginning on world-building, but rather it felt like he let the world of Midkemia spring up around a diverse and interesting cast of characters. I loved all of the main characters and felt them grow and change as time passed, even when months or years passes between two pages.I'm not a big fan of cliff-hangers so I thought the end ofMagicianwas really well executed. I started the next in the seriesSilverthornthe same night because Iwantedto know what would happen next, not because I needed to.In short, there's a good reason why so many people listRaymond E. Feistas one of the best fantasy writers.
