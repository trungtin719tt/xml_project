of COURSE i made a list for this one!LOCKED ROOM MYSTERIES FOR FANS OF MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS*A locked room gathers many corpses. But HOW??*Murder on the Orient Expressis one of Agatha Christie's most revered books for a reason. She uses the trope of the locked room mystery as a foundation and then further heightens the "impossible" crime by situating that locked room on a moving train. If that's not enough reinventing of the old mystery wheel for one day, her solution is also a bit of a game-changer, but I'll not say too much about that here!Iwill, however, offer some suggestions for readers looking for locked room mysteries that are a bit off the beaten path. During the Golden Age of Detective Fiction, locked room stories were very popular, and those of you who are interested in classic examples of the genre should have no trouble finding print anthologies or online archives to explore. But i'm drawn to the "yes, and..." approach to writing, with conventions given a little twist, genres blended, those unexpected tweaks that make a book memorable. So, while these books all feature locked rooms of one sort or another, there's an extra bit swirled into them that makes them stand apart from the crowd.Happy sleuthing!list is here:http://www.rifflebooks.com/list/24789...
