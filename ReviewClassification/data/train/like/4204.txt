As with all of Shel Silverstein's poetry collections, this one is fresh, imaginative and highly amusing. The cleverness of his poems often made me chuckle to myself and I love how well his poems flow. This is truly an "all ages" sort of book, and I can see both adults and children giggling in delight over it. The illustrations are also well done. This man was extremely talented, and I love everything he's ever written.
