Rereading with my buddies, edgy and sleepless. Bring on the Barrons!!New thoughts after reread:I was actually thinking that Mac was growing a bit in this story, and I was really proud of her for standing up to the Mob-guy... until she utters this ridiculousness:"Go ahead, O'Bannion, come and get it. I'm fed up with jack-petunias like you."Original review from 2014:So, in Georgia they call the hot lava game "don't touch the alligator"? That's just weird! Everyone knows that when you are kids, you pretend the floor is covered in HOT LAVA, and that is why you jump from beds to dressers to couches to tables, etc... There was even an epic episode of Community where Abed and Troy start a giant hot lava game at the school for Troy's last day. It was dean-tastic!But, it figures that Mac would have a stupid name for the game. She can't even swear like a normal person. Idiot!The action in this book does get better than the last and the dark characters are really interesting. I like the complexity of the story, and how it keeps growing as time goes on. Nothing ends too quickly or neatly, which is nice. And, Mac has gotten a tiny bit smarter, more so in the beginning of the book, but she has a long way to go to get to your average person's start point.It seems pretty obvious, though, that Mac is still making way too many stupid assumptions. And, her stubbornness combined with her stupidly false bravado is going to keep getting her almost killed and waiting for Jericho to save her every book.
