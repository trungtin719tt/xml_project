Russo delicately weaves together the stories of the residents of a small town in Maine struggling through economic downtimes. Russo's characters are complex, his prose is warm and his plot is intriguing without being too convoluted or self-important. One of the best books I have ever read, I couldn't pick up anything else for two days after finishing this one.
