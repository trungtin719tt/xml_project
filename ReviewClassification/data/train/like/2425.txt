I think it's more a 3,5*I don't know what I expected but it sure wasn't what I got! (Yeah shame on me, I actually did not see the movie up until a day after finishing this book)Tbh the big plot twist towards the end of the book wasn't that big of a twist to me. It was actually pretty obvious. But to be fair, I think back in the day when this was published, it probably was something new and shocking. Nowadays this is used so often as a plot that it just didn't surprise me anymore.But besides that it was so unique and intriguing, I enjoyed it a lot. It's not like anything else I've read in my life. It took some time to get used to the writing style but once I did it was quite genius.Still, I can't give this more than 3,5*.I really don't know what keeps me from giving it 4*, but something just didn't klick with me while reading, I guess.PS: I watched the movie the day after I finished this and I can't really say what I enjoyed more.
