"Book - you have the right to a speedy trial" - reviewTHE DEFENSE- The story is both heart-warming and heart-breaking at times. Anyone looking for a good cry(or an ugly cry, or a proud cry, or, well, any kind of cry, really), this is the book for you!- Both lead characters are extremely likable and sympathetic.- The book does a brilliant job portraying the bleakness and tragedy of war and the many different ways it can affect people's lives.- Werner's story is particularly effective. Watching him go from being such a sweet and innocent child to being swept up in a movement he does not agree with but feels powerless to stop is immensely powerful.- Marie-Laure's early experiences with her blindness and learning to cope with it were well portrayed.THE PROSECUTION- When the book isn't tugging and at your heartstrings so hard you now know what a marionette must feel like, there's no denying it drags at parts. Marie Laure's story in Saint-Malo stagnates for a while before it picks up again. Also, the constant technical descriptions of Werner's repairing and working the radio equipment made my eyes glaze over at times.- The reader risks dehydration from all the tears they will cry while reading this book! There was more than one moment where this is pretty much an accurate depiction of what I looked while reading:THE VERDICT"All The Light We Cannot See" is one of the most powerful books I've ever read. It's not a perfect novel and maybe could have been shortened somewhat, but the gripping and emotive segments far outweigh the dull ones. The events of this book will stay with me for years!FULL REVIEW TO COME
