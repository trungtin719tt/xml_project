This is my seventh journey into the fantastical lands of Narnia, as I have chosen to read the series in chronological rather than publication order.What a fitting end to such an epic series! Despite having a darker message and more serious tone than the other stories, I enjoyed this just as much as the previous books.It has been centuries since the last sighting of the mystical Aslan and his name has turned from legend to myth. With some falsely using his name and status, and others denouncing him altogether, it is left to the returning children from our world to save Narnia once again.Despite a similar running theme, this seemed aimed at a more adult audience. There was some dark imagery and an overall more sinister tone. However, as an adult reader myself, I enjoyed these new aspects.I adored seeing the return of old faces and, without them, this would not have been a proper conclusion. I am sad to say goodbye but I know I will be returning, probably soon, to one of my new favourite fictional lands.
