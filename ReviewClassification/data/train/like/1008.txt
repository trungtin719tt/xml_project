EDIT 14/4/2015:And now my fourthwatchreread had ended. Still as good as I remembered and I can finally see the depth of foreshadowing GRRM put in.Also, R+L=J for sure.A Guide to ReadingA Game of Thrones:Step 1: Find a comfortable place with lots of lightThis is a hefty book, ladies and gentlemen. Standing at 835 pages, it will take you more than a few hours to tear through. So get your bathroom breaks in, have a cool drink and a platter of cookies by your side and bar your doors in case of unwelcome distractions.Step 2: Resist the urge to give up in the middle of the prologueIt's tedious, I know. Things only start getting interesting after the Starks find the direwolves, which thankfully, is in the very next chapter. But unlike certain prologues *cough*Twilight*cough*, this one plays a purpose.Step 3: Don't panic at the enormous array of charactersDon't try to commit everyone's name to memory. Seriously, don't.All those titles...It has little use (all men must die) and will only trip up your enjoyment of the book. Go at your own pace and soon, they will all feel like old friends.Step 4: Let go of all grand morals and social conventionsThis is no fancy world of noble knights and swooning princesses. This is a startling realistic fantasy land of rape, misogyny, incest, murder and above all, political scheming.And you will sympathize with them. Or at the very least, understand them.WarningStep 5: Do not get attached to any of the charactersI believe that line speaks for itself.Step 6 (because you will most certainly not obey step 5): Save your tears. There are six books to goStep 7: Rinse and repeat forA Clash of Kings
