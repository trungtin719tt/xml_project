In this latest book, Hunted, the main character Zoey, goes in even deeper than ever before. The intrigue, romance, adventure and spiritual awakening are more intense. Even the bad characters draw you in and make you want to believe in them and often it's difficult to find the fine lines between the good and evil. Really enjoyed this one.
