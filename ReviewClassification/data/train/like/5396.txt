I never read this book as a kid. It sounded too girly. But it's a classic, so gave it a shot.It's a slower read, for normal juvenile lit--owing to the fact, I'm sure, that it was written more than 100 years ago. Compared to other things I've read from the same time period, the book is a page turner! And it's a page turner compared to most of the adult fare I read, too. But it's not a lightweight book in terms of wordiness, length, and descriptions.It does have a good dose of religion, but Spyri manages to not make it preachy-sounding. Clearly the book is written with a lesson for children, but it's also a fun story and the setting is breathtaking. Truly, I want to live in the cabin on the mountaintop!This is a Pollyanna story, and I dislike Pollyanna stories. Everything turns out perfectly for everyone, and Heidi never thinks about anything, she's just adorable. Heidi is like a drug that everyone is addicted to and can't get enough of. I imagined, in my head, a sequel that put Heidi, 5 or 10 years later, weighed down by the burden of having 7 people need her and not being able to meet everyone's needs. Get a life, people! There's only one Heidi Sunshine Ball!Having said all that, I also adore Heidi. Matter of fact, I'm addicted to my own real life Heidi: my youngest son. He brings happiness and sunshine where ever he goes. If I hadn't met my son, I wouldn't have thought it possible: no one is as happy and cheerful and life-giving as Heidi. But he is. And it's a beautiful thing.*update: I liked this book enough, I bought it.
