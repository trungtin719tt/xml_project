I read this in high school back in the 1970's when I was involved in Campus Life/Youth For Christ. All my friends read it one summer, and the movie played in our town.Yes, I was a hippie Jesus freak with crosses and doves embroidered on my bell bottom jeans. I carried my bible everywhere and was insufferable.The book was good, though, even if I wasn't.
