Death will catch us all, grab our bones and run, but few as unaware as those whose deaths have been foretold.Everybody knew this will be his last day on earth. Everybody knew why they will kill him. Everybody but him. This is one of my favorite short novels from Garcia Marquez. From the title to the last word we know what will happen and why but the surprise is hidden in the was it right?If you want a book that will leave a endurable mark in your subconscious ramblings (you know, those little thoughts our brain thinks about without our consent) try this one and then tell me if there was a reason for him to die.
