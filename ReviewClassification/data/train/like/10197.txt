"Cyrano de Bergerac" is basically about this swordsman named Cyrano, who is an amazing fighter and poet and is in love with his cousin Roxanne. The only bad thing is that Cyrano has a huge nose which keeps him from approaching Roxanne in earnest. Anyway, there's also this other guy that likes Roxanne named Christian, but although Christian has really good looks, he is a screw up with words and doesn't know how to communicate with females. Finally, there's another guy (whose already married) that is in love with Roxanne named De Guiche, and he's an older gentleman who is consistently annoying in the book.I'm not much of a play guy so reading this at first was a bit awkward for me... but I grew to like it. I might've given the book five stars if some of the annoying acts with De Guiche were cut out, as well as when there was supposedly "humorous" scenes that didn't work out for me, but overall I thought the plot was really tragic and beautiful and I ALMOST cried at the end. Haha.
