I absolutely love this book!!!! This book never gets old and never stops being fun to read or hear. We LOVE this book!For years Thea pretended to "pop!" from the egg. She still does sometimes. And this book is how she first learned that animals EAT other animals..She knew birds caught worms. But it wasn't until I asked her what the baby bird was going to DO with the worm that I realized she didn't know. She said the worm was going to live in the nest with the baby bird. Like a pet.So I, somewhat mischeiviously and after recovering myself, told her ... He's going to EAT it!She was horrified. The look on her face was awesome. Because, really? Who'da thunk it? animals are food??? She thought they were all friends!Yesterday, in her animal book, there was a picture of a lion in mid-air about to tackle a gazelle or some such animal. She said "Look! He's going to climb on his back! Like I climb on yours!" The truth is a little more reality than I want her to have... so I said "Yup! Just like you climb on mine!".
