.I've seen this referred to as a masterpiece of science fiction, but it's less about the science and more about the faults and failures of humanity, in this case Americans. He delivers a sharp slap to the face of American racial prejudice, aggressive colonization, wastefulness and disregard of the environment. I think Bradbury would be shocked to see the same conditions existing in the 21st century. He would also be shocked to see we haven't sent any humans to Mars yet.This is a collection of short stories that taken as a whole has the appearance of a novel. It very much reminds me of Sherwood Anderson'sWinesburg, Ohio, which he credits with influencing the structure of Chronicles.I'm sure many readers have avoided The Martian Chronicles because it is mid-twentith century science fiction, but Bradbury rises above the cliches' of the genre to offer a view of who we are and what we need to change before introducing ourselves to future "Martians".
