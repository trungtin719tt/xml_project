Excuse me while I get up on my soapbox. I love Roald Dahl. I always have, and I always will. Although some may disagree with me, I think the most important thing that a child can be encouraged to do is to dreambig. There isn't a children's book that Dahl has written that doesn't kickstart the imagination. Now, I admit, I'm only 19, so I don't pretend to know a lot about child-raising, but I stand by what I said--it's important for kids to imagine and believe in the impossible. I mean, c'mon--as a kid, I grew up believing that I could live in a giant peach with a bunch of bugs as my friends...that I could one day own my own magical candy factory...that I could get back at any "mean" grown-ups by using my mind to mess with their day. Now, I'm still a big kid at heart, but if there's one thing I dearly miss from childhood, it's the ability to believe in just about anything. That being said, I think it's just as important for adults to spark their own imagination from time to time. I'm not much of a grown-up myself, but the needs of my imagination are why you'll find me checking books out from my library's childrens' section.Anyway, I suppose I should get down off my soapbox and actually review this book already! I loved it, naturally. This is one of Roald Dahl's books that I hadn't read as a child. (::gasp:: I know!) I loved how this normal little girl becomes friends with a giant, and even the Queen of England! I laughed out loud when the BFG confused Charles Dickens with Dahl's Chickens. My favorite part of the book, though, was the BFG's jumbled form of language and all of the words and phrases he made up. A book for all ages, I'd recommend it for any child, and for any grown-up with a bit of child left in them.
