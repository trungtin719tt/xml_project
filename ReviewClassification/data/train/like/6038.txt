Out of the four Sherlock Holmes novels written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, The Hound of Baskervilles is the best. If there is ever a murder-mystery written with an ingenious plot, suspense, intrigue and action perfectly balanced, it, in my opinion, is undoubtedly The Hound of the Baskervilles.I first read it when I was about ten years old. It was both a fascinating and a scary read for me at that time. I remember imagining that a large fierce hound might appear in our backyard and being uneasy at being there in the night! :) Almost thirty years later I find it even more fascinating since I have outgrown my fear. :) And also this time around I could appreciate the genius mind and brilliant power of deduction of Sherlock Holmes. Out of all the Sherlock Holmes books that I have read so far, this is where Sherlock Holmes exhibits his brilliance.The mystery around the hound always fascinates me, although I know very well what it is. I love how Holmes unravels the mystery and lays out the plan to catch this "devil" of a beast using a human "bait" to lure it out from its lair. To me, this is the climax of the story where suspense and action is in its height.The scientific element that is involved in this mystery is impressive. I was awestruck with it as a child and remember discussing it with my mom. Luckily my mom being a doctor and knowing full well of the story kept me well guarded so that I would not end up doing some "mischievous" experimenting! :)I really loved the read this second time around and enjoyed it very much. It took me to my childhood. And although I remembered the story very well from my first read as a child, this didn't for a moment lose my interest in the read. No matter how many times I might read this in the future, I know that each read will be a new and fascinating one for me. And that is exactly why that this murder mystery is the only one in my favourite shelf.
