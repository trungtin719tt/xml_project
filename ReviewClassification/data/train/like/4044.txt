Such is life that some people are convicted of nonexistent crimes while others are elevated to brilliant careers despite evident character deficiencies.Who but Kafka can show the absurdity of "justice" in a world where power trumps reason, and political strength trumps fairness?Is it only me turning paranoid, or does Kafka become more and more "realistic", as our world turns more and more "kafkaesque"?Maybe the Non-Nobel Prize in Literature this year could go posthumously to all those dystopian, surrealistic writers that saw our world of today before it existed? To Kafka, Orwell and Borges - from the Swedish Non-Academy, convulsively in the Process of Metamorphosis to Kafka's bugs? A Non-Nobel to Kafka for prophetically writing his Cassandra-call to a blind and deaf-mute humanity!
