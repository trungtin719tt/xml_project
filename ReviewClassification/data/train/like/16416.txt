Can a pond being an ocean? Sure! Why not?DON'T THINK IN LIMITATIONS BUT POSIBILITIESNobody actually looks like what they really are on the inside.Once you can get to accept that a pond likely can be a whole ocean, you will then enjoy this wonderful book.I think that Neil Gaiman, the author, was a genius even deciding the length of the book.Sure, the initial intention was to make a short story that ended inton being a novel, but at 181 pages of length, it's most likely a novella.However, that's the beauty of the concept.Can a book being a library? Mmh...Since, in these 181 pages, you have a fairy tale, a horror story, a family drama, even adventure, humor, philosophy, etc...A THICK BOOK ISN'T GUARANTEE OF ANYTHING GOODA story only matters, I suspect, to the extent that the people in the story change.Neil Gaiman can accomplish so much more in just 181 pages than other authors in 700 plus pages.A big book isn't a guarantee of being any good.A short book can be as much fantastic, if not more.Even it's more respectful being able to create a so rich story in so few pages than having 700 plus pages and not resolving anything.Sometimes people can think that only thick books deserve respect and don't get me wrong, there are many thick books indeed worthy of respect, but the quantity of written pages isn't a certification that any book is indeed really good.And certainly there are also bad small books too.But I can tell you that......this is a small bookANDit's reallly good!LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVINGNobody actually looks like what they really are on the inside.This is a story where I can assure you that I was so scared at some moments than in other books clearly labeled as horror, and I was so astounded with the magic here than in other books clearly labeled as fantasy.Even if you know some of Neil Gaiman's influences when he was a kid, you will be glad to see them here in a way or other.Even if you read really carefully you will get to know about where certain other writers got some ideas for their own insanely famous books, letting clear that sometimes author's originality is just a matter of reader's ignorance.Highly recommended!
