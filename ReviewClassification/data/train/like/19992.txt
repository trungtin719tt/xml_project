My all-time, absolute, favorite book ever. The 'stranded-on-a-desert-island-with-only-one-book' favorite. I can read this one over and over.Hitch-hikers, lesbians, whooping cranes, feminine hygenine products - it has everything. And written in a lyrical manner that begs to be read out loud. (Trust me - I have done this. Parts of this book are poetry.)I haven't given away as many copies of this as I have 'Good Omens' because I think it doesn't have as broad an appeal. I wish it did. Really - everyone in the world should read this book. It will make them realize that we are all individuals, and yet all human. Size, shape, color, religion, age - none of that matters. I'd mail a copy to George W. Bush, but I fear that his reaction would be "I liked the birdies".And it has one of the best character names of all time. I love odd names. I have run across a lot of people with strange names (since I have worked in the payroll field for twenty years, I have seen a lot of people's paychecks.) Truly - I have known of people with names like Robbin Banks, Marina Fishman, Hedy Cheeseman, and Angel Frankenstein.But none compare to the glorious, delectable, vivacious - Bonanza Jellybean.
