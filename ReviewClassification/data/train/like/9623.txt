Perhaps this talks to me more about my life than other Williams masterpieces do. I don't know, but reading through the whole "gentleman caller" preparations made my very soul shiver. The author has split his personality, and you have Amanda, Laura, Tom and Jim somehow unifying to reflect themselves both the unit and the broken pieces, the ashes of glass that are the reader --at least in my case.A thing of beauty in Williams' hands will always bleed straight from the heart. His symbols, states of mind, moods, the delicate tragedy which he makes out of the world's cruelest instances, even the failure that lies behind a successful tale of survival connotations, all hit too close to home. I don't think Williams is for everyone, and yet, apart from The Glass Menagerie's most singular traits of storytelling, here is an artist altogether aware of his tools to the point of elaborating a rather brilliant self-commentary on the way fiction works --including how it can turn to be a revenge of sorts against suffering.I absolutely love, adore, the climaxing scene where Laura's dream suddenly begins to be fulfilled only to end up crashing in a nightmare of depressive realisation. Miraculous just about describes the God-given insight that allowed Williams to get to know the precise events and feelings and reactions, and consequences, which drove my life to deadly stillness before a heavenly awakening that prevented me from falling into everlasting oblivion. Amanda is the promising past --not unlike Blanche would soon be--, and Tom is the delusive present; however, Laura rests on that sofa or sits on this floor, holding her pet glass unicorn, in a place out of any chronological consideration --a real-life reject left behind in her own niche to shine, a prematurely withered moth, because the light was out.
