5+ Stars. I do not know how to express the excellence of this amazing story!Ido knowI willneverforget it, and that reading it as a buddy-read made it all the more enjoyable.(great powwow book)DO NOTmiss this remarkable novel. Highly recommend!(and bring on more Alexandre Dumas!)Update: March 18, 2016GOD WILL GIVE ME JUSTICE(carved into the wall in the 'memorable' prison scene)Really enjoyed the 2002 version of the film with Jim Caviezel playing Edmond Dantes, and although the novel ismuchbetter and will remain one of my all-time favorites, I actually preferred the ending depicted in the movie. Great flick IMHO.(showing now on Starz for those interested)
