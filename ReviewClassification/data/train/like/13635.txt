Finding Hope in the Darkness of Grief is a beautiful book. Most selections are short, so you can easily read one and take time to contemplate its meaning and how it touches you. The calming lavender color of the interior pages is a nice contrast against the artwork and black text. This is a book you hold on to and take out when you need it. I look forward to more of Ms. Lavendar's work.
