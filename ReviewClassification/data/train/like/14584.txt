OMFG.I loved this book SO MUCH. I couldn't put it down. Why you people don't like Julian? He's PERFECT, I tell you, perfect. I liked Alex, I really did, but I LOVED Julian. I'm totally team Julian, and I'm willing to know what happens in Requiem.AND THE ENDING. It has the worst cliffhanger EVER. Well, the worst in a good way. I started cursing when I finished it, lucky I already have my copy of Requiem with me and I'll start reading it tonight.OH, words can't express how much I loved this book and how much I loved Julian. I loved the fact that Lena could find love again and ahhh... I'm so happy and I have a knot in my stomach because OMG, poor Alex. What is going to happen now?OMFGGGG.
