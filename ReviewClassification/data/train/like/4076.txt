**2019 UPDATE**The still-breathing film adaptation due from Lionsgate gets a director...of an EPIC flopthat raked in a whopping $1.5MM on an investment of $9.5MM!Sounds like awizardidea, doesn't it? Simply corking! Who better to guide a beautiful book onto the oh-so-welcoming moviegoing audience's radar!Rating: 6* of fiveSometimes, some books just don't lend themselves to an analytical, opinionated review. I'm reluctant to do that kind of review here and now because the experience of readingThe Night Circuswas like smelling a magnolia blossom...perfect, sweet, rich, satisfying a need I didn't know I had until it was met...but to examine it, to handle it, even gently, risks that somehow the magical smooth gorgeously textured vessel of chastely erotic pleasure that this book is will let it begin, inexorably and inevitably, to brown and curl and die, and become...just a wonderful book.I'm not ready for real life yet. I want the magic to linger just a little longer.The physical book itself was a Christmas gift to me from a GoodReads friend, and to him I offer humble thanks on bended knee. This was in the top five reading experiences of my life, and will most likely remain there for the rest of it. I am changed and exalted. And it is thanks to you, and your gift to me.This work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
