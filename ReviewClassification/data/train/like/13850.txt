While overall I liked the book, still, some niggling thoughts ate at the corner of my mind as I made my way through Exodus.Whereas this book is fiction, for some reason, I came to this thinking that what Uris put down is very close to fact. What worried me as I read it, is that it isn't. Why? Every Jew good, every Arab bad. (As well as the British who colonized Palestine at the time of Israel's independence.) That's too cut and dry for me. In every conflict there is a right and wrong, this I believe firmly, but too often the lines blur. There was no room for that in this book. As much as I want to believe it's all true, and it is what it was, I know that it is not.Although, I do enjoy historical fiction more when based on facts- that's okay with me. It's fiction.Stylistically, the story recounted a story rather than show one- which is unfortunate. The love stories were sweet but not terribly engaging (except for Karen and Dov- we needed more of that one!), and he had a habit of dropping characters off the face of the earth. (What the heck happened to Mark what's-his-name, the reporter at the beginning of the story?)What I did like was the re-telling of the horrors of Nazi Germany and the History of the Jewish race from the "Jewish Pale of Settlement". (Not that I like to hear it, but because we need reminded of it every once and awhile), and how he introduced characters by their history and their family's history.And yes, ok, I cried at the end. If you're at all interested in history, Jewish history in particular, you should pick it up, then tell me what you think.
