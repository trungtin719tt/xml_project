Waiting for Godot still waits for a review. I wonder if it will ever come. While pondering on the possibility of a review, I think about whether I liked it or not. I can't even say that, so technically, ...... I am still waiting ... for the rating ... as well ...It is in the stars. I added some for decoration. They are quite meaningless, but yellow dots please my Scandinavian eyes.It is about nothing, really. ButNothingwas already taken by Henry Green - and also filled with so much of everything - that Samuel Beckett probably thought he'd wait and see if he could find a better title than nothing. While waiting, he gave it a working title, and that's what the play turned into. The process became the end product, and the waiting for something became something of its own.As for the characters. They talk, therefore they are.One of them asks me:"Are you ready to write?"And I say: "Yes, let's write!"But I don't move.
