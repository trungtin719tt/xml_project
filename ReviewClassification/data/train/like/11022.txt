This novel is a fictionalised account of the Battle of Gettysburg, considered by many as the turning point of the American Civil War. It is a very intimate account told through the eyes of the key participants, often moving and the battle scenes, though infrequent, are very vividly told. I was surprised to learn that many of the military leaders involved actually bore little ill-will towards their counterparts, having fought together side-by-side in other wars and wished fervently in their hearts for the war to end. However, as military men their sense of duty prevailed and they were forced to wage death and destruction on their own brethren. The main message is that any kind of war is a devastating, soul-sucking endeavour but the pain is magnified when it's brother against brother, countryman against countryman. This novel won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1975.
