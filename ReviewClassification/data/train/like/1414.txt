First 5* of 2019.There are so many reviews about this one that I have no idea what to write. I will just say that I regret not having read it earlier. I had it in my shortlist for about 3 years and for different reasons I kept postponing to start this dark and wonderful gothic mystery. Don't be like me! Read it now!
