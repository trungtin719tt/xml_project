A bittersweet animal story, but at least with enough "sweet" to compensate for the "bitter" portion, and definitely compensates for the trauma of the other animal story I read previous to this. I especially liked that the road to White Fang's ultimate happy ending was framed as a redemption arc that's both a redemption of humanity for its brutality towards wildlife and a redemption of the wolf-dog from the cruel path that adversity and human influence had thrown it into.
