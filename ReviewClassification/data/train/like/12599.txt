This book will charm you to your toenails whether or not your daddy is a preacher, you live in a small Southern town, or your dog sneezes when he smiles and is named for a supermarket chain. BECAUSE OF WINN-DIXIE follows newcomer Opal Buloni as she acquires a ratty, smelly mutt in the aisles of the eponymous grocery store, grooms him, and loves him. The dog loves her back and her minister father too. Before you know it, Opal is going all over town, making friends, finding part-time work, even cultivating an unsung genius. What didn't I like about this book? That it ended. Good reading for the early middle grades, a read-to for younger children.Update - October 22, 2018: In response to questions from other GR members, many of the Winn-Dixie stores have been sold off to other chains in the South. However, many Winn-Dixie supermarket locations still exist in northern Florida, in and around Jacksonville. Surely this Florida story would be just as charming if the dog had been named Publix or Albertsons or even Walmart. A real charmer!
