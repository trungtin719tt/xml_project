Fast fun exciting funny sad read. Appropriate for any age, but especially (IMO) for those who like a wonderfully well written love story between the races set in fascinating places and times. Rich Lizzie Stafford, plotting to take down her ambitious philandering husband (San Francisco's DA and poster boy for high political office to come), sets her sights on a scandal that ought to destroy him. She woos the very mysterious head of Chinatown's biggest Tong. What comes next is a page turner, something to make the heart speed up, even break. I really really loved it. Why four stars instead of five? I honestly don't know. I guess because five stars is reserved only for those things which change me in some way.
