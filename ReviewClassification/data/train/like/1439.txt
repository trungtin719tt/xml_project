This book is such a FUN FUN read. If you are in mood for a light stress-buster, this book is just PERFECT.I haven't seen the movie and this book was a surprise for me. I love the author's writing style and the way Matilda, her family and her life in general has been portrayed.There is underlying humor in the book which is very subtle but an absolute joy to read.I loved Matilda, she is absolutely amazing and I would want to be friends with her in real life.I love that she loved booksMiss. Trunchball is completely unbelievable and the things she does to kids can't be real but it is still fun to read how Matilda deals with her!
