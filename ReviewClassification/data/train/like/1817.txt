This is such a beautiful series and I had a great time the second time around. I can't wait to read this to my son someday-----------------------I was not expecting this to become a new favorite! It has a similar style to Peter Pan and it's SO FREAKING FUNNY! I loved this so much and am SO EXCITED to continue with the series!
