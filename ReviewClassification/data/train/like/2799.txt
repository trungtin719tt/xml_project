My first Nick Sparks book, a beautiful one too. At first I was kind of reluctant to read it since the story is set in 1958 and I thought it was going to be slow and well, boring. Boy was I wrong, this book was engaging and I feel that it's very entertaining to read the book in Landon's POV.I particularly love the stark contrast between Landon, the bad boy gone good, and Jamie, the devout Christian girl who is everything nice on the surface and with closer inspection, a strong character whom I find myself admiring and can't help falling for (much like Landon did after he got to know her).It is amazing, not to mention touching to see how their relationship from an unlikely friendship develops into something much more. It is very seldom to find their kind of love, which is pure and honest in today's teen/YA novels.(view spoiler)[One of my favorite parts is when they were celebrating Christmas together, they were exchanging presents and only at this point that I realized how real their feelings were towards each other. I was smiling the whole time and it was so beautiful, so romantic! I have to admit a lot of tears were involved (both sad and happy) during this particular scene.(hide spoiler)]A poignant novel that broke my heart and proved that miracles do come true... Fair warning; make sure you are in the vicinity of Kleenex, they really do come in handy. A lot. Of course, eating comfort food later sure helps as well.Highly recommended for those seeking a beautiful story about young love.
