This is the cutest thing i ever read! I'm already thinking how many times i'm gonna read it to my future kids and my niece in the future!I don't really like resuming the plot, cos it's just to sweet and everyone should have the chance to read this book instead of finding out what's all about from a review.The conclusion is so wise and the words simply gorgeous, beautifully and simple written that it touches one's heart!
