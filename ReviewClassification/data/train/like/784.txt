When I read Anne of Green Gables I was admitted into the world of orphan Anne Shirley and her life in Prince Edward Island, Canada. I fell in love with her and her adoptive parents, brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert. Mrs. Rachel Lynde, her meddling neighbor, and Gilbert Blythe, who would become Anne's lifelong love, were also introduced early in this book, the first of eight novels telling the life story of Anne Shirley. I've read every one and it remains one of my favorite series.5 shining stars.
