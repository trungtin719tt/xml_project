This book is so much fun! I used to take clippings from magazines with book reviews, found an old clipping about this book cleaning up the house recently and thought... mmm... let's read this one. Timing was impeccable. I went through an explosive challenging period of really hard work and high pressure in the office and this book made me look forward to reading if only a few pages when coming home. A quirky funny story about a boy called Stanley who is sent to 'Green Camp Lake', a boy's detention center after supposedly having stolen a pair of sports shoes from a famous basketball player. Being innocent, he blaims his no-good-dirty-rotten-pig-stealing great-great-grandfather who ran into a curse which affected Stanley's family over years and years. Camp Green Lake is in the middle of the desert, a dried up lake, and every day a scary ward and guards, amongst who a 'Mr Sir', make the boys dig holes there. So, what's going on?....I had so much fun with this book, excellently written and the story... who can make it up? All factors combined, also the timing of this book in my life, right book at the right time, couldn't be better. A sympathetic enjoyable story, really quirky and just pure FUN. Recommended!ps: Curious about the movie too, never saw it (yet).
