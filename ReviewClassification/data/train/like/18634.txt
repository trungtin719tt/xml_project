A 20th-century classic that succeeds on two levels: As a searing indictment of totalitarian political systems, and as an absorbing human drama. My initial feeling of revulsion toward the protagonist, Rubashov -- a former high-ranking government functionary, now imprisoned and charged with crimes against the state -- ultimately gave way to a grudging sense of compassion. At the story's climax I somehow resisted the urge to set down the book, walk down the hallway, and start drumming my hands on my bedroom door. (An "inside" reference, for those who have read this book).Recommended to fans of George Orwell's1984. George really likedDarkness at Noon; there's a good chance you'll like it, too.In closing: How come there's never been a major theatrical film adaptation of this book? It would make a fine period piece, and I'd love to see it on the big screen. Until then...five stars.
