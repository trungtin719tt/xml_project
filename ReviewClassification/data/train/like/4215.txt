I used this book for a talent show in Jr High. I don't remember what poem I did, but one that I incidentally memorized along the way is still really funny to me.Crowded TubThere s too many kids in this tub.There s too many elbows to scrub.I just washed a behindThat I m sure wasn t mineThere s too many kids in this tub.I quote it for my kids and they look at me in shock and then start giggling. The imagery is just too good. :)
