"The world's a hard place. It don't care. It don't hate you and me but it don't love us, either."My relationship with horror stories is a weird one. I hate them, but my fascination for them always overpowers that feeling. It may take me ages to pick up a certain book or watch a certain movie but at some point curiosity always kills the cat (and satisfaction brings it back.)The only Stephen King I've read before isCarrie. I didn't find it either really frightening or exciting, but it was good. And I just knew thatThe Shiningwould be on a whole new level. So it was.The foreshadowing was the worst. It held me tight in its grip and nearly crushed me. On the other hand, it made the story predictable.Apart from that, I'm fascinated by how amazingly well constructed the characters are. Same thing applies to background details like the hotel's history, its former owners and guests.King also leaves many questions about the hotel unanswered, which is equal parts torture and genius. That's something I really love about authors: when they don't spill all the secrets, so you'll never totally let go of the book.Find more of my books on Instagram
