It's the late 1940's and I could visualize the setting of the New Orleans French Quarter(love it)and hear the jazzy blues music playing thru the window as Tennessee Williams brings to life the characters of averywell-built Stanley, his better-half Stella, and her delusional, whiskey-drinking southern belle of a sister Blanche who is in town for an "extended" visit.With two women and one hot-tempered, suspicious man in a dinky one bedroom flat, trouble starts brewing at the onset and never lets up until the ill-fated end."Whoever you are.......I have always counted on the kindness of strangers."As a first time read for me, the story behindA STREETCAR NAMED DESIREwas a complete surprise as were the multitude of controversial subject matters often understated in presentation throughout the play, but still.......A powerful and emotional drama. Loved it!(need to get my hands on a copy of the film version with Brando and Leigh.....fast)
