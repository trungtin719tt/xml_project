This is the second book I have read from Dan Brown. I readThe Da Vinci Codefirst. And, whoever readThe Da Vinci Codewould think this book does not measure up to the other book's penmanship.But, I liked this book. This book has the same breath-taking suspense that does not let readers put down the book until the mystery is solved.
