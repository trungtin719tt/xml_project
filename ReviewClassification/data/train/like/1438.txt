I've seen the movie three times already and always loved it but it wasn't until recently that I finally bought the book. Roald Dahl truly is the master storyteller everyone calls him!Every book he wrote (of those I've read so far) seems to have sort of a signature style that makes the reader recognize the author while at the same time the tone of the book is different. The characters are unique and have wonderful depth - which is not self-evident since the books are fairly thin. Each story features a completely different topic but each story has its very own, very wonderful world.In this case it's a kind of "normal" world. The world of a little girl with cruel parents (a second-hand car dealer and a housewife) that neglect her. However, that doesn't stop Matilda. She teaches herself to read and spell and calculate and becomes a wonderful little person. Eventually she also goes to school, meeting other children, a wonderful teacher, but also learns of the hardship other people sometimes have to face. Thus, the reader is plunged right into a funny adventure with mischievous children. It was a delight! xDThis edition, just like the one ofWitchesfeatures cute little illustrations by Quentin Blake that round off the reading experience.I think no matter how good the other stories by Roald Dahl,Matildawill always be my favourite because it's about a bookish, courageous girl that, despite her young age, knows right from wrong and teaches others a lesson or two (also, I taught myself how to read when I was 4 so I can identify with Matilda quite a lot)!
