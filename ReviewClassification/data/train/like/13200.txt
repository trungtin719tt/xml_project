Another vacation in an exotic locale, another murder to be solved by Agatha Christie's detective, Hercule Poirot. I enjoyed Christie's Death on the Nile. Amid excursions to Abu Simbel and other ancient Egyptian sites, Poirot becomes acquainted with his fellow travelers. I liked how Christie used the locale and focused on a smaller set of characters (at least a smaller set than in Murder on the Orient Express) to get at a deeper familiarity of our suspects. Death on the Nile is a quick read and very accessible. I doubt I'll come away being overwhelmed with how Christie uses language or her insight into psychology, but I liked this one. 3.75 stars.
