Edited after seeing the movie:I went with my daughters to see the movie adaptation ofThe Hostthis evening, and was reminded of how much I loved this book. That said, it's as it was with theTwilightbooks-to-movie adaptation and the movies didn't do the books justice, and neither did it forThe Host,which is one of my favorite stories.My point is, please don't let the movie scare you off. If you go see it and find the story compelling but the acting not so much, please pick up the book and read it. It is so, so good, but there's too much story packed into the novel to fit it into a 2 hour movie and make it work.-----------Original Review:Another fabulous story by Stephenie Meyer. Who ever thought a love triangle could exist between 2 people?I loved the descriptions, the characters, the conflicts and the resolutions. There's one thing that you can count on Stephenie Meyer to deliver, and that's a tale with intricately woven story lines, lots of plot twists and turns AND a happy ending.I'm hoping she'll be writing the next books in the series, soon!
