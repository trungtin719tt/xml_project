This book was so beautiful and heartfelt and beautiful and I can't even handle it!!It's a quiet, deep, tender and warm story about the main character dealing with grief, how that affected her life and how she's trying to hold it together for her family. It's about her self discovery and first love.I love how Sarah Dessen was able to showcase different ways of people dealing with grief and what their choices were. How important it is to have people in our lives who can bring something more out of us. The family dynamic was messy and painful, but believable. The writing style, smooth and effortless. It slowly seeps you in, hooks you until the last page. I wish the ending would've been slightly more cohesive, but this book made me FEEL!Now, all I want to do is read more Sarah Dessen books!
