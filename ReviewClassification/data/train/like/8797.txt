"Brideshead Revisited" is almost the opposite of Waugh's own "Vile Bodies"/"Bright Young Things" in that it starts off as a tragedy, or at least pretty damn close to E. M. Forster's "Maurice" territory (thus tres tragique) and ends in such a jubilant &amp; comedic form (sorry for this mega old spoiler). It seems to me that Waugh is a master of Contrasts, &amp; it works all too well... the book ends &amp; the reader is deeply disappointed that it does. I practically ignored most of Seattle as I read a paperback version of this brilliant book.It begins and ends at completely different sides of the spectrum: the Oxford years seem idyllic and maudlin, the protagonist has not yet been completely corrupted, though we do become witness to that voyage. The second part completely has Charles being both antagonist and sick voyeur. He does completely nothing to stop the decay around him which culminates, just as in "Vile Bodies", in WW2. All the bourgeois goes under... &amp; the Oxford crowd is forever dismantled. It's drama, comedy, tragedy--all in one! Quite the accomplishment.I will read this again. SOON
