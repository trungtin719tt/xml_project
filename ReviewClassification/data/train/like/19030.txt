Anne is a little older and goes to school at Redmont with her friend, Prissy. Along the way they meet Phillippa Gordon (who may be my favorite character so far in the series, I mean besides Anne of course!). Phil, Prissy, and Anne find a house to let -- quaint and practically perfect. The house is called Patty's Place and they all soon move in. They find themselves with three cats- a fireplace, and imagination which makes for a lovely setting. Anne is trying to figure out what love is and how she feels about it, she gets proposed to multiple times (a few times elicited chuckles from me) and finally meets Roy Gardner- a wealthy man that meets Anne under an umbrella after "rescuing" her from the sudden rainstorm. (sigh)I really enjoyed Anne at this age, even still her stubborness got in her own way in regards to Gilbert. I almost got to a point where I would never forgive her, but luckily it all worked out in the end. THis book was more mature and as a byproduct had sadder events that tug at my heartstrings(view spoiler)[ (Ruby Gillis)(hide spoiler)]. Looking forward to the next book in Anne's story.
