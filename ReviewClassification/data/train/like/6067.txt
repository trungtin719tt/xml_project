Hey parents, do you want to read a children's book that will make you cry uncontrollably from the third page all the way to the end of the book?Well look no further, this is the book for you.Honestly? It's a very sweet book. But get ready to do all the crying while your little kid looks up at you, with an expression that says, "Seriously dad, what the fuck? Do you need a tissue or something?"
