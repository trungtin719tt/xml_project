I was as frustrated by this book as I was addicted to it. Rosie and Alex were always in love with each other but never at the right place at the right time, both emotionally and physically. And neither would admit their feelings. I tore through the pages muttering under my breath that if the author did not make things right EVENTUALLY, I would lose it. I won't give anything away.I thought it was adorable that Rosie's daughter Katie had a relationship with a boy named Toby that completed mirrored Rosie and Alex's relationship except that Katie was always able to follow her dreams whereas the world kept slamming the door in Rosie's face over and over AND OVER again. It was sad, really, because Rosie was a great person - full of life, love, and humor.I loved the secondary characters, especially Stephanie (Rosie's sister)and Toby. There were parts of this book that were equally heartbreaking as humorous, but it came together in a way that made my heart swell.I really loved this book and highly recommend it to fans of chick lit and romantic comedy.
