I read this is college and really liked it. I wasn't aware how one sided it was (very pro-zionist) until I was talking about it with a friend of mine who was studying Israeli/Palestinian history. While reading I assumed this was historical fiction, meaning the characters might not be real, but the events in the story were true and presented objectively. Well, it needs to be read carefully, with the understanding that the writer had a very strong point of view in favor of the Jews. My friend recommended I read a book called "Blood Brothers" which discusses the similar period of time from another point of view. It was also a good book, and a nice counter balance to the propoganda in Exodus. All that aside, I liked the book for what it was, and although I don't remember details of the story, I remember enjoying it.
