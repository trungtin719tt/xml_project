5 bloody brilliant starsNumber #9 in my Agatha Christie Challenge this year.The Murder of Roger Ackroyddefinitely my favorite Hercule Poiriot mystery(so far). Agatha Christie once again leads readers to a small English community where EVERYONE has a motive and open windows and locked doors make this the kind of mystery that needs our favorite Belgian detective. Our story is narrated by local doctor, Dr. James Sheppard who lives next to Poiriot and soon finds himself as the Watson to the Belgian's Holmes. I do believe that A.C. might just have created my favorite literary character cast as I found each of them utterly delightful. Although Caroline Sheppard is perhaps my favorite!Highly recommended!
