A fan from the first few pages ofThe Secret Magdalene A Noveland now a bigger fan than before. FLow Down Like Silver takes place mostly in Alexandria just as that great free-thinking cosmopolitan city is feeling the first full effects of the new religion of Christianity. Hypatia, brilliant and famous, stands above it all shining out as the voice of generosity and reason. But times are growing darker. Just as I did with The Secret Magdalene I had to buy another copy of the book so I could highlight all the passages I loved or caused me to shiver with recognition or insight. What a writer and what books!
