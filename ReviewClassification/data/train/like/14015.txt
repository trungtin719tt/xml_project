"Dandelion Wine.... The words were summer on the tongue".We all love to travel, one way or another. That's why we read! To experience time; To experience new worlds; To experience...And sometimes, we find those peculiar time machines that take us to somewhere special. Let's say, a reminiscent of nostalgic childhood. That one is always special. My favorite in that category areTo Kill a MockingbirdandMalgudi DaysNow I have Dandelion Wine... And It is different from all these books!In Dandelion Wine,Ray Bradbury welcomes us to Summer of 1928 in the fictional world of Green town. We are introduced to Douglas, a 12-year-old boy, and his brother Tom, a 10-year-old. We follow them through an array of loosely connected stories of summer of '28. The kind of stories that just don't happen in our world anymore. A kid finding himself as he understands that he is alive and his reaction as he understands the unfairness of life and death; A family man trying to create a happiness machine; An elderly woman trying to convince the young children that she was young once too... So many beautiful stories.This work is considered as Bradbury's most personal work as the stories presented in here are a blend of his own childhood and imagination. This wicked concoction produces a world of magical realism, wonder, innocence and pure imagination.This is a unique work that touches multiple genres and a multitude of philosophy through the eyes of children. Well, they are not the regular children you find in fiction. They are the thoughtful kind of children. I never knew there were thoughtful children like these in the world!Highly recommended. Especially if you like lyrical prose, coming of age stories or/and the movieBig Fish (2003)Oh, wait. There is also a serial killer lurking somewhere in the town.Needless to say, summer of '28 was very eventful.--------------------------First Update--------------------------Sometimes, there might just be a story behind how a particular book gets into your radar.Dandelion Winehas such a story to tell!Back in 2015, I was catching up with some of my dreadful assignments and tasks which took hours to complete. I was exhausted by the end of the session, but not at all sleepy(I deduce that it was all the coffee that did the trick).So I decided to watch a movie to kill some time. And the movie wasAge of Adaline.Oddly enough, I liked the movie. And there was this one particular scene that really caught my attention.I am not a romantic, but I adore this scene. It also created a mental TBR for me. My own personal"Flower Trilogy".AndDandelion winecame to me first.I don't have a book review right now. This......this book is something else. I might need days involving hours of wall staring to fully comprehend what I've just read.But I will tell you this,Dandelion wineis so damn beautiful.
