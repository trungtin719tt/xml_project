This book deserves 4 stars at least. It is well done, deep and introspective. There is nothing cliche here and yet, it is about something completely mundane in a very good way.I absolutely recommend to read this book.In terms of personal tastes, I would give this book 3 stars. The topic is one that usually doesn't absorb me much, and the only reason I read it is because all the good reviews it has. The pace was slower that I usually like; same with the excitement level. However, I am very glad I did read it. This book lacks some elements that I usually look for in a story, but it was undoubtedly beautiful and well crafted. That it is way I decided to give it 4 stars instead of the 3 that I would normally have given it. In this particular case, it didn't feel right to lower it's rating just because my personal tastes. As I said before, the 4 stars are well deserved.The Truth About Forever is a good book.
