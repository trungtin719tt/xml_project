Strangely enough, I loved this one a lot more than all the other short stories by Rowling. Perhaps it's because they're actual stories with characters and even moral underpinnings, or perhaps this collection just hit the spot. :)I enjoyed Albus's voice here, but in the end, I think I simply enjoyed the tales for themselves. Little dark fairy tales. :) I have nothing bad to say about little dark fairy tales. :)
