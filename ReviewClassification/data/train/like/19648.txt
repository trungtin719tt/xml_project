Reality: 4.8This is a book with such a large scope, that it's a surprise that Clive Barker was able to go follow it through to the very end. It does show in places that it is a very hard journey to have maintained throughout.If there was a flaw in this book, it would be the fact that Clive Barker has such a picturesque vision of the Imajica that he tries to put down every bit of detail that he can. This not only slows down the narrative, but makes the characters seem as though they aren't what's important. They are being used as an excuse to help layout the scenery. It truly shows in the beginning, where the story takes place in the boring (compared to the Imajica) reality of London, as well as the beginning sights of Imajica.The story doesn't really pick up it's pace until the second book (the Reconciliation) where all the puzzle pieces of the last were being played out. It is here that every twist and turn (some expected but put in such a way that the reader is still surprised) is given it's pay off.The ideas within this book are easy to grasp, and at times you wonder if he could have been a bit more subtle with things.I know i'm being pretty rough with the book, despite giving it a 4.8. It's that when you have such an incredible book and a long journey that finally ends, and you look back on it, these are the parts that come to mind because as much as I loved them, it felt flawed. It is still worth the time to pick up and read, no matter how slow it may feel at first.
