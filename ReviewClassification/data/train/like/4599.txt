I just finished reading this yesterday and it was an amazing read! Thanks to Kimberley for recommending this to me for the September Book Pals Online Recommendation Swap at A Good Thriller on Goodreads.Cold Mountain Penitentiary is home to the murders, rapists, serial killers, and all whose heinous crimes makes them walk the Green Mile (Stephen King's version of Death Row)and sit on Old Sparky's lap in E cell block. In the Green Mile, you will read the narrative of Paul Edgecombe block Supervisor and his chronicles of how him and his fellow colleagues dealt with the miracles and horror there by the inmates John Coffey, Delacroix, and Wild Bill Wharton as they all prepare to go on their date with death in the Green Mile. Definitely check this book out for yourself if you'd like to know more.I enjoyed this book. It is just like the film version. It is a commitment just to focus on King's work instead of reading other books because his books are very long. It was worth it in the end as this book made me cry, want to Gibbs smack Percy for what he did in the book, and I was in awe as well as other emotions that ran through me while reading this. If you are a Stephen King fan or new to his work, definitely give this book a check out as you'll enjoy it. This one will be added to the list of the Stephen King books I have read and enjoyed so far.
