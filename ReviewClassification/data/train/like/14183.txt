More reviews @Anti-Drug ReadsI don't know why, but I wanted so much to hate this book... And in some ways I did- Not because it was slow, boring, or uncreative, but because it grossed me out seeing how anyone, even I, could meander down the wrong path so easily. Crank really made me look into the mirror and rethink my standards/morals. This is definitely something EVERY TEEN should read, for it teaches an important lesson. I give Ellen Hopkins 5 stars for this masterpiece. It may not have become one of my favorites, but a poetic masterpiece it is none the less.
