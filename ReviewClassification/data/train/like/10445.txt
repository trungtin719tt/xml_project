A wonderful coming of age story of two children, with beautiful prose and a few miracles and life lessons thrown in for good measure.The characters are what made this such an enjoyable read for me. Swede, so wise beyond her eight years, loves anything pertaining to the American West and writes amazing poetry about cowboys. Her eleven year old asthmatic brother, Reuben, the narrator of the tale, and their father head West in their Airstream to find the oldest son Davey, who has escaped from jail while on trial for murder. Their journey appears to be mystically routed for them, as their luck along the way seems predestined. But once they stop for an extended stay in the Dakotas with a woman that they are instantly taken with, their luck is about to change.A classic.
