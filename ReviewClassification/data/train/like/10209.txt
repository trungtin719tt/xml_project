Cyrano de Bergerac which was first performed in 1897 was part of the last wave of versified drama. Plays in flat prose have been driving people out of theatres and into the cinemas for most of the last 80 years, but it seems that there is no turning back. Rhyming speech is unlike to ever return to drama. Hence this trite little cape and sword melodrama will probably stay in the repertory for a long time as nothing is likely to be written to replace it.The poetic qualities of the French version are remarkable which means that it has a following even amongst the young, the hip and the au courant.For someone who will need to read the play in a language other than French, I advise them to not to bother. Take in a performance instead. Cyrano is a fabulous vehicle for a ham actor and thus often is a hoot in the theatre. Another possibility would be to download the movie featuring English subtitles composed by Anthony Burgess and Gerard Depardieu who is one of the greatest scenery chewers of the last fifty years.
