Watch my review &amp; discussion here:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txeTr...What a WONDERful first book of the year! I read this book almost too quickly, I wanted it to last longer. This might be technically a children's book, but it really was such a special and meaningful read and I highly recommend that everyone read this once in their lives!
