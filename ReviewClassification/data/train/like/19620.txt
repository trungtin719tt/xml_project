I readThe Thief Lordtwo years back when I was in Venice for skiing holiday. The book is excellent, and combined with the right surroundings I was smitten.Venice in the winter is misty and dreamy, and when we walked around the city, I could almost see the Thief Lord running around with his friends, cunningly planning their theft, getting more and more mixed up in the plots of grown-ups around them. Funke's storytelling is wonderful, her characters believable, and, for a children's book,The Thief Lordis stunningly good.
