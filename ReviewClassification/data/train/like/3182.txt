An excellent Arthurian saga.Written from the point of view of Morgaine, Arthur's half-sister and the villian of traditional Arthur tales.Unique in perspective with strong female characters. It is a story of love; and quite different from any Arthur novel you'll ever read.Marion Zimmer Bradley's best work. She paints a vivid picture, rich with depth of characters and relationships.One of my favorites, I can read this over and over again.
