Really enjoyed this! The plot took a while to kick in but I loved the characters and I have a new ship!The audiobook has a full cast and is so well performed!Rep:Blindness (harmful rep). The character does have magical abilities that give him heightened other senses that "make up for" his disability.Content:A father with gross intentions toward his daughter. I couldn't quite tell if this was incest or other physical violence. He is said to enjoy torturing other children and animals. Some of the animal torture is described briefly.
