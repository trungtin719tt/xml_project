Just finished my most recent rereading of GWTW and fell in love with this book once again. Margaret Mitchell never fails to weave her magic no matter how many times I've read it.GWTW is not just a romantic story involving Scarlett, Ashley and Rhett but also a well researched account of the civil war.Since the victors always write the history concerning any war it's fascinating to learn about the other side of the story.
