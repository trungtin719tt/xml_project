If you would like to read a different interpretation of the story of Mary Magdalene's life and the life of Jesus (Yeshua) then this is a must read. The historic research that Ki Longfellow has done must have taken a lifetime, and the story sounds entirely possible, perhaps probable. It drags in some places, but there are also parts that sound so true that they gave me goosebumps. Longfellow includes insights into the hidden truths that run throughout all religions and spiritual paths and sound as though they were channeled directly from the Spiritual Masters.
