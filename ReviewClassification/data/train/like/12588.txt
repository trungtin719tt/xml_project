Opal Buloni goes to the Winn-Dixie store, and comes home with a big scraggly dog she claimed on impulse. Because of this dog, now named Winn-Dixie, she meets her new neighbors in the Florida town she now lives in. Nothing bad happens to the dog. Let me repeat: Nothing bad happens to the dog.This book is carefully balanced with dark and light. It could so easily have been one of those syrupy, sweet stories with charmingly eccentric townspeople spouting folk wisdom, and the dog bringing everyone together at an ice cream social. But it's not. The town is only a bit twee. Opal's mother left her and her minister father. Gloria, one of the townspeople Opal meets, used to be a drunk.Still, a magical synergy of some kind brings everyone together as friends. Nothing bad happens to the dog.I love this book.
