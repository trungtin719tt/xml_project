"There have been as many plagues in the world as there have been wars, yet plagues and wars always find people equally unprepared"I knew what I was letting myself in for here, hence the title, but damn this was grim, and it certainly wasn't an easy read. As early as when the description of the huge rats came about, I was actually sitting here and shuddering.Once the plague is discovered in the quiet town of Oran, humans have no choice other than to face death head on. This is something no individual is likely to want to do, as we as humans, try to avoid such a path. The fact the the society is forced to confront and face death, is rather interesting to read, as we notice people react in rather different ways. Some run to their homes and lock themselves away from the community, some carry on with their everyday errands oblivious to what is happening around them, and some run off. Yes, they leave their loved ones and run.If you are looking for something riveting, this book is not the way forward. This book is a philosophical work that studies what happens when disaster strikes, and inevitably, what happens afterwards.At the end of the book, Camus informs us that the bacillus can remain dormant for time, before it is awakened, and can then begin to kill off unsuspecting mice in what would be referred to as a quiet and peaceful town. This alone, has made this one of the most frightening and thought provoking books that I've read to date.
