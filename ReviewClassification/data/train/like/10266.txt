The further I get into this series, the more I enjoy it! I'm enthralled with the stories of these young characters in this paranormal world. With every book, the plot thickens and another layer of the mystery unfolds.This third book had many tests, turns and revelations. Some, I expected and some were completely surprising to me. All of them pulled me deeper into this story and left me craving more.Action was also plentiful in this book. An epic battle ensues that will keep you wondering what will happen next. The dynamics are constantly changing as new characters and relationships are revealed.I am hesitant to say much about this book, because I don't want to spoil the secrets that come to light. There is a lot going on in this book. If you're a fan of paranormal/fantasy, this is a great book.Of course, this book leaves just as many questions unanswered as you had going into it. Some mysteries are solved, while others surface. One truth revealed seems only to lead to another question. This was no big surprise, since this book is in the middle of the series with plenty more to follow.Overall, I thought it was a great continuation of this series. I enjoyed every minute of this rapidly changing story. I'm so glad that I listened to all of my Goodreads friends that told me the series got better as the story progressed. They were so right! I can't wait to see where the next book will take me.
