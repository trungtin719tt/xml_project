Sometimes funny, sometimes sad story of a brilliant young girl whose body does not reflect what is happening in her mind. It was a bit of a mix of Wonder and The View From Saturday. The book is very honest, and captures the ups and downs of Melody's life, as well as that of her family. I did feel like, as observant as Melody was, we didn't get a lot of details about the parents or her schoolmates as we went along that would have helped us understand their reactions to things, but other than that I can really see why this book gets so many accolades.
