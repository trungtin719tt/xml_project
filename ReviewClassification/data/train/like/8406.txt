This is the book that Zoey has completely lost it."Stop playing games with me. And you think Aphrodite is a hateful bitch? You make her look like a fucking angel!"So Zoey basically still juggles between three males: Erik, Heath and Loren. And it seems that Loren is winning, while Erik (her supposedly boyfriend) will soon face betrayal. And he will not take it gracefully.Before the end of the book:-one of them will be dead-one will be heartbroken and-one will be his usual absentminded selfVery dark moments for Zoey.Her friends will feel betrayed and used.She will feel betrayed and used.Her only purpose now is to save Stevie Rae.For that reason, Aphrodite will take Stevie Rae's place in the circle.Before the end of the book :-one of them will be a vampire and-one of them will be human again."Remember when we thought me having a sucky birthday was our biggest problem?"Very sad book. One of my least favourite in the series.
