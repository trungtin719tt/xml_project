The story arc in this one is "on the edge of your seat" fun. San Francisco in the Twenties, East Coast mobs moving on the Frisco tongs, the secrets of Chinatown revealed, politic intrigue, a real US President mysteriously dying, a spoiled rich girl using the head of the Chinese Tong to hurt her awful husband, and on and on. But the character arc of Lizzie, the little rich girl, lifts this one out of mere entertainment into a fascinating study of human growth and human sorrow. By the way, the writing crackles and the story sizzles along. Comes with a big A+ from me.
