Had no idea this was so cray. A buttock eaten off?! Wha?! All sorts of murders, pillaging, calamities, earthquakes, generally violent happenings. The best of all worlds, indeed. All of it moving forward at a quick clip, never worrying if a character who's been hanged or disemboweled reappears a little later just fine. Satirical, philosophical, funny like the butchered Black Knight in "The Holy Grail." Loved the bit about scholar of good taste's advice for what makes a successful tragedy -- what seemed like straight-up authorial sincerity slipped into the serious silliness. Ultimately it's lesson is keep quiet, be industrious, cultivate the garden, stop thinking so much and do. Reminds me of the zen koan in which the enlightening punchline is "wash your bowl." A fun read that maybe felt a little overlong at 120 pages. Seeds of Vonnegut definitely and Kosinski maybe. Will read more Voltaire this year.
