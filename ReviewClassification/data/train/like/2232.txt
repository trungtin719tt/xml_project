I'm at a loss to explain why this novel is so special, but special it is. Haddon operates on the Poe principle - not including any wasted words, making every character come to life with a minimum of description and fewer lines of dialogue. I fell in love with the narrator, but I am not certain why - except perhaps that he's transparently innocent and confident in his constellation of quirks, preferences and behaviors that many would characterize as off-putting and/or anti-social. It is difficult for him to move through his world. It is difficult for those who love him to parent him. Heck, it's difficult for the police to assist him, when that assistance is necessary to his well-being. But he's unforgettable and I found myself rooting for his success in every interaction he has and each event that transpires. Oh, and the dog of the title? Such a red herring. It's only there to lure you in and it serves that role well.
