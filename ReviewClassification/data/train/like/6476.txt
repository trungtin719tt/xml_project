these are the things i have done for this book:i have given up my birthday, waiting in line from 5 until its midnight release, braving the crowds and noise and commotion...i have missed my subway stop and ended up taking the crappy way into work...i have seriously considered calling out of work to sit at home and finish it...i have read in elevators, while walking down the street, walking up the stairs, while eating dinner without even tasting it...i have rushed my beloved dawn powell's book, racing through it so i could get to this book as quickly as possible...i have come home to a laundry bag full of clothing that needed to be folded and a bunch of dishes that needed to be done - ignoring which usually gives me mental discomfort... but i did...i have thrown off my netflix schedule for the week...i have read this book in one day, and now i am wanting more...*********************************************************************************i just realized that this book comes out the day after my birthday. which means i will then be 33, and will have waited in anticipation for a TEEN FICTION book for almost a year. and i will probably read it in a day, and afterward feel utterly shattered withlacking. and then i can go be a grown-up again.but for now, i can't help it, it's that good of a series, and i have given up any adult-shame i might have felt for bouncing up and down in my skin with wanting this book this very minute.32 and still a child...come to my blog!
