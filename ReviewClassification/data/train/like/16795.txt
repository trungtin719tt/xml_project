I've loved Peller's other "To Live" books, and this one was both very different and very challenging. I read a review comparing it to Hermann Hesse's work, and now that I read the book itself I have to agree. The intoxication, the dual personalities of the protagonist, strong female character that coaxes and seduces a man into becoming more than he thought he could be...Peller seems to definitely be influenced by Hesse. The plot of this book is intriguing in that it mirrors so much of the political revolts going on at this time around the world. Will certainly read it again after taking time to digest this first "holiday reading."
