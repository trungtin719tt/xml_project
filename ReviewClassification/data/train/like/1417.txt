Wow, what an absorbing experience! A true gothic romance, it's one of those books you just fall into and luxuriate. The tension in it is almost physical, smothering at times. It builds and builds so painfully perfect, I was sure my chest would explode before I got to the end. Never before have I come across a book that never tells you the main characters age...what she looks like...her backstory... NOT EVEN HER FRIGGIN NAME! But because of the exquisite prose you get to know her so intimately, I was completely absorbed in her thoughts, what she sees and feels. THIS is what a good book does to you, for people that don't read I almost feel sorry for you for I wouldn't give up this feeling for anything. I've found out that Alfred Hitchcock made a movie of this book and I can't think of a better pairing, this story was made for the Hitchcock touch. I can't wait to see his translation, maybe it will help me curb the nagging need to reread the book immediately! It's been a long time since I've added a book to my favorites of all time and this story has taken it's spot, hell, it deserves it's own shelf.
