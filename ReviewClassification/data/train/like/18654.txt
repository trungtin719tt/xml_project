This was the best yet! When I read the first book in this series my reaction was : meh- I can't remember what persuaded me to read the second one but it turned my opinion round. And now the third instalment has completed my re-education.Mercy Thompson is such a great character. She has backbone, she is completely loyal to those she loves, brave, curious and the cast around her are just as interesting .I read this in only 2 sittings and loved every minute. Towards the end there is a traumatic event that happens and this and its aftermath are dealt with in the best of ways by Patricia Briggs.The love triangle is over and I'm keen to pick up in the next book where this one leaves off.Recommended. ( But read the series starting at the beginning!)
