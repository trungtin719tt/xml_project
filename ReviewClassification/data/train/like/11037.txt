What with a second Like of a the previous blank review (to say nothing of the pathetically non-puissant comments I've made below regarding the desire to read it again), I have become aware that I must reread this in the coming year. Must. Must.Must!The only thing to prevent it is my memory of the declaration I've just made. I still have the book after all these years. Shame on me.Actually I've now done something at home that I think will make it a high-probability read in 2018.. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .Previous review:The Works of ArchimedesRandom review:The MisanthropeNext review:2017 on GoodreadsPrevious library review:Look Homeward AngelNext library review:Without FeathersWoody Allen
