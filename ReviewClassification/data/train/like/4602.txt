Me and my sister, who is the coolest sister ever, got this for each other for Channukah one year. I mean, we didn't buy two; we split one copy to share, because we grew up on Calvin &amp; Hobbes, and we even stillcommunicatein Calvin &amp; Hobbes sometimes, where one of us will describe the first panel of a strip, and the other will answer with a description of the last panel. The one about the smocks (where they're supposed to be sculpting and Hobbes gets obsessed with the smock and the last panel is him going "Smock smock smock smock smock," and an incredulous Calvin is all, "What on earth is wrong with you?!?") will still collapse us into giggles until we weep.In case you are less obsessed than we are, here is the one I mean:And in case you doubt my eternal devotion, I did this for my birthday this past year:Anyway, my sis &amp; I even built a special shelf in my apartment for this book to rest its glowing head upon. BUT, because I am almost unbearably lame, I have yet to take it off of its perch and read it. Why? Perhaps because I am so in awe of Bill Watterson that I am afraid to sully its glorious pages with my dirty fingertips. Perhaps because merely to behold it brings me more joy than reading almost anything probably could. Perhaps.But eventually I will read it. And I will love it more than probably any other book in my library.
