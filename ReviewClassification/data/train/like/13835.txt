Part of the Pratchett reread with theSpecFic Buddy Readsgroup. Yet another in an absolutely golden run of Discworld novels (Reaper Man,Witches Abroad,Small Gods,Lords and Ladies,Men at Arms... the series never again has as many unreservedly brilliant books in a row).A small country on the Circle Sea, Omnia is a religious theocracy dedicated to the worship of the great god Om and the whole country is eagerly awaiting the appearance of the next Prophet of Om. Meanwhile, the real people in power, mid-level officials in the Church, are waging war on various other of the countries around the Circle Sea. Brutha is a novice of the Omnian church working in the temple gardens one day when the great god Om begins talking to him. Only Om isn't so great: he's actually a tortoise whom only Brutha can hear. Brutha soon comes to the attention of the Church Quisition and the Head Exquisitor Vorbis, and gets involved in a mission to neighboring Ephebe and their "democracy" and weird relationship with philosophers.Pratchett was a secular humanist and had quite a lot to say about religion through his life. Here is one of the more specific places that he addresses religion (Good Omens: The Nice and Accurate Prophecies of Agnes Nutter, Witchis another, and in both cases he's got quite a lot to say, some of it negative. A lot of it really appreciative of the good works that religious organizations can perform, but there's also warnings about where and how their works can be turned to evil. And like a lot of Pratchett's writing, the difference comes down to the fundamental goodness of good people.Ther's a lot in this book made of how Vorbis's true evil is how he can make others think like him, doing evil reflexively. Less is made of Brutha's influence, notably on Om in particular, working to make others think like him and be fundamentally decent.One of the best books in the series in my opinion, and nothing about the reread has changed my thoughts on that.
