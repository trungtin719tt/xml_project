Re-read after 15 years. It wasn't as good as I remember, but the audiobook narrator occasionally irritated me with his delivery so that might have had something to do with it. I'll actually re-read the sequelClaudius the Godand see if the written word has a different effect.I also re-read this concurrently with watching the 1976 miniseries for a long long overdue first time ever, enjoying it more than the book version. It's highly doubtful I'll ever unsee Brian Blessed as Augustus &amp; John Hurt as Caligula. They are historical canon to me.Despite all this Julio-Claudian gorging, I still can't get enough of those dysfunctional, inbred miscreants. I know some historians get in a snit at Graves' use of Suetonius and other biased &amp; gossipy sources, but it makes for some fantabulously page-turning primetime-soap-in-togas trash. And that's all that matters in my world.Wheeeeeee!
