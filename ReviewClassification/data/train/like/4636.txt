man, fourth grade was a good year for reading! this is another one, and fed my urge to be able to survive on my own even further. this is beautiful because it's based on a true story (she leaves the island with her skirt of cormorant feathers, which is on display at mission santa barbara) and because she was alone for eighteen years, and hid from russians, and dealt with wild dogs, and the loss of her brother.it is beautiful, haunting, and a story of survival. it's also very much a story of california - the earthquake, the seal hunting, etc. i can appreciate now why ms. hart assigned this to us - at the time, i was simply thrilled i got to read about binding whale bones with seal sinew to make a fence.
