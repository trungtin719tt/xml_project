The book started out slow and for the first half of the book there was no real "scare" factor. Most of the book was no one believing that the daughter Ragan was possessed, but instead that she just had some psychological problems which were causing her transformation of an innocent girl to a stark raving lunatic. Most of the book was about the psycharists that were treating her and their thoughts about what was causing her mental illness.The book finally started picking up pace with more things happening regarding the possession of the daughter and then when the priests became involved with them trying to exorcise the demon, the book ramped up. As far as "leave the lights on scared" though this book is a classic, I did not find the atmospheric spooky, creepy feel that I was hoping to experience.In my opinon, I think the movie was far more scarier than the book. The movie freaked me out when I saw it and I wish the book had spawned that same terror for me while reading it, but I never felt the same "fear" within the book. Four stars for this one.
