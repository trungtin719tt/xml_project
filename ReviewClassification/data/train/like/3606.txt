The first of Irving's blockbuster novels that won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1980. Be forewarned that there is a hyper-focus on sex in this book. It can be shrugged off for the most part. But he is consistent in this area and unabashedly remained true to a motif of explicitness throughout the book.So I didn't fall in love with any of the characters. Helen, Garp's wife, is perhaps the most likable of the characters but she herself has a lot of baggage and is embroiled in several affairs over the years including being caught in the act during the infamous car accident scene towards the end of the book. Garp's mother, Jenny, is perhaps the most memorable character. She seems to be somewhere on the autism spectrum. Jenny clearly accomplishes the most of any of the characters including her work for women's issues.Lest we think Irving is clueless, he does make fun of his own tendency to obsess in writing about sex. In the book within the book T.S. Garp is also a bestselling writer and his latest book is entitled 'The World According to Bensenhaver'. Garp is maligned and attacked by women over his chauvinistic attitudes. He also writes a lot about wrestling which I did not find terribly interesting.4 stars. It is clear from the first pages of The World According to Garp that Irving is a mega talented writer. I probably don't give him enough credit but this is a memorable book that is tied up with a neat bow and one I won't forget soon. His writing seems effortless at times and it's easy to follow his plot lines. I just wanted him to write about something different. Eventually he did just that with his masterpiece Cider House Rules -- a more mysterious and better constructed novel.
