The beginning of this book was a real stinker. I couldn't believe it was getting 4 star reviews from people. After the first couple of pages, I was ready to throw in the towel but I kept going and I am glad that I did. I am almost finished with this book. I will forgive Dumas for the first couple of pages - okay for me the first 45-50 pages. Because the rest of the book has been very good...should finish the book later today.
