Hands down, this is the funniest book I've ever read.Some of Heller's sentences are so witty and hilarious that I had to not only laugh out loud, but set the book down after trying to continue on--and laugh out loud some more to fully appreciate all the wit. That being said, the style of humor gets old. After a while, it feels like reading Seinfeld screenplays for hours on end.The crazy ironic predicaments Yosarian, the focal character, finds himself in are pure genius. And some of the subplots in this novel are better than classics in and of themselves. But, even with that in mind,Catch-22 is incredibly complex. The chapters can at times feel like puzzle pieces that don't connect to anything else. The beginning, although entertaining as hell, is particularly convoluted. For the first ten chapters or so, it feels like character introduction after character introduction--like there's no plot until about 30% of the way through the book...Partly because of that, the story loses it's impact, but more so because it's so damn funny it's hard to take serious. Even though the characters will stay in your mind forever, it's hard to care about them because they're SUCH characters to a point they feel unreal.Am I saying this isn't a masterpiece? No. It's more confusing than a riddle at times, and I'm sure I missed some important things. But even still, there's only maybe two other books I'd rather have read than this.
