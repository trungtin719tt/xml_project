I enjoyed this teaching in one long, lovely sitting...after having practiced the Ashtanga Yoga Primary series, sitting in a cafe with my jasmine tea while a thunderstorm pounded outside. A powerful read/lesson. I've tried to read other translations before, but Mitchell's really resonated with me."...The undisciplined have no wisdom,no one-pointed concentration;with no concentration, no peace;with no peace, where can joy be?When the mind constantly runsafter the wandering senses,it drives away wisdom, like the windblowing a ship off course..."-Bhagavad Gita (2.66-67)
