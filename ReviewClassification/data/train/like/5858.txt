Since I saw the movie before I read the book, I must preface my review with that fact since a comparison between the two was inevitable and, moreover, greatly influenced my opinion of the book. I loved the movie! I liked the book. Unlike most book-to-film adaptations, however, I felt that the movie had more character development and more details; and, indeed, more heart and more humor. I cannot objectively consider the merits of the book because I missed so many aspects of the movie-story as I read. I just kept wondering if I would have liked the book better if I had read it first...That said, I give the book four stars because parts I felt were only three-star-worthy and parts were quite outstanding. Sometimes, it seemed Gaiman was struggling--that he was *trying* to be clever, imaginative, poetic, rather than simply *being* so. Other times, truly lovely and creative passages and ideas came across effortlessly. I felt the character development was lacking--as a cast of characters, he managed to assemble an interesting bunch, but no one was particularly special or deep. The love story was, to my romance-loving tastes, underdeveloped. And Gaiman seemed to the idea of "a fairytale for grown-ups" to mean that some rather vivid scenes of sex and violence (and the occasional curse word or crudity) were obligatory. Strangely (and thankfully!), however, I never felt he was mocking or cynical of the idea of a fairytale; indeed, his seemed lovingly crafted with due respect for magic and adventure and faerie-worlds.The basic premise of the book and movie are the same, but significant changes in plot and character development (even the cast of characters) provide a few surprises no matter which order one choses pursue. The movie is heartily recommended; the book is recommended, with reservation.
