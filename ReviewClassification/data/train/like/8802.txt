"I loathe snobs," says Saul Bellow, "and Waugh is one of the worst sort...but snobberyandpiousness?" Saul Bellow can't even. And you see his point. No one inBrideshead Revisiteddeserves redemption, and yet here it is, with the bullying certainty unique to converts. Evelyn Waugh (he's a dude - here's apronunciation tutorial) converted to Roman Catholicism at 27, and here we are with one of the great Catholic novels, in no way as subtle or conflicted as the work of fellow convertGraham Greenebut just as powerful.Waugh's ability to write cinematic scenes is the strongest sinceThomas Hardy's.Brideshead is one of the great locations in literature and, like Manderley inRebecca,the main character in the book.This isn't how it looked in my head but it isthe exact estateWaugh had in mindTop Ten Fictional Locations10.Hogwarts9.Pemberley8.

TheGreat Green RoomAnd like Nick Carraway fromThe Great Gatsby,Charles Ryder is one of the great passive narrators, an outsider, an infiltrator. You could make an argument that he's destroying the Flytes one by one, but that's not what Waugh thinks. He's certainly less passive than he first appears.There's this one scene, on a trans-Atlantic boat rolling sickeningly in a storm: "I found myself flung across her pressing her against the rail, warding myself off her with the arms that held her prisoner on either side," and with the spray exploding against the window a woman whispers, "Yes, now," and there's Hardy in all his melodrama and passion. Then Charles totally ruins it by describing what happens next:It was as though a deed of conveyance to her narrow loins had been drawn and sealed. I was making my first entry as the freeholder of a property I would enjoy and develop at my leisure.Don't think Waugh doesn't know what he's doing, giving you literary whiplash like this. He knows. Charles Ryder sucks at sex.To some extent, God fucks up what's otherwise a perfect book. Dipsomaniac Sebastian becomes(view spoiler)[some sort of holy drunk(hide spoiler)]; Julia(view spoiler)[dumps Charles because God(hide spoiler)]; old Marchrain(view spoiler)[converts unconvincingly on his deathbed(hide spoiler)]; Charles himself(view spoiler)[finds God for some fuckin' reason(hide spoiler)]. "The conclusion ofBridesheadis as cruel to the nonbeliever and, I imagine, to some believers, as it is repugnant," writesMichael Schmidt,only somewhat overstating things.And yet. The parts that work work so well! There are passages as well-written as anything I've ever come across, whole pages that you flip back and start at the beginning again on, just to prolong the pleasure of reading them. The characters are ambiguous and compelling. This is Waugh's Great Novel, in which he abandoned (mostly) his usualbloody satireand got down to business. It's serious business.
