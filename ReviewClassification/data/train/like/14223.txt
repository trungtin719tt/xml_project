Sartre is an author I don't like very much. He's also one of the few authors I almost always agree with, unfortunately. If that is not enough to cause some nausea, one can add a bit of existential anxiety and here we go: by hitting Sartre in the face with Camus' idea of the absurdity of life, I have confirmed Sartre's bleak outlook on humanity as well. If I had liked it, I would have solved the Catch 22 of life!Sartre is hard to stomach because he doesn't add any decoration to the account of human misery. He just puts it out there.Or wait - there is ornament.In the form of black symbols on white paper, he serves treatment for the illness: to write is to exist!So as a reader, I have no choice but to write a review, to prove my existence in time and space, or maybe in letters and ink? Code in cloud?I read, therefore I am. It doesn't mean I have to like it in the sense of giving pleasure!
