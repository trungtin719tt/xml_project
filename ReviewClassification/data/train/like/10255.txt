The first encounter I had withThe Last Unicornwas as a child (how fitting) when my step-dad introduced me to the movie. I remember falling in love with the art and the music and I've watched the movie once every year ever since.Then, a while later, I got the book and read it (the German translation). It was very good and different from the movie in some places (for example, the story of the curse and the village before Haggard's castle). But for the longest time, it was usually me and the movie and its haunting theme song by the band America:When the last eagle fliesOver the last crumbling mountainAnd the last lion roarsAt the last dusty fountainIn the shadow of the forestThough she may be old and wornThey will stare unbelievingAt the Last UnicornWhen the first breath of winterThrought the flowers is icingAnd you look to the northAnd a pale moon is risingAnd it seems like all is dyingAnd would leave the world to mournIn the distance hear her laughterOf the Last UnicornI'm alive! I'm alive!When the last moon is castOver the last star of morningAnd the future is pastWithout even a last desparate warningThen look into the sky where throughThe clouds a path is formedLook and see her how she sparklesIt's the Last UnicornI'm alive! I'm alive!(Here's the opening scene of the movie for those interestedhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxoJL...which beautifully incorporates some actual historic art that portrays unicorns.)Now, the group decided to read this classic and I finally found out how beloved this book is and that it is actually being heralded as a true classic. I knew it was well-known, but I was surprised that the author was named alongside some of THE greatest writers in the fantasy genre. So of course I had to re-read it, and read it in English this time!Therefore, I bought the beautiful 40th Anniversary Editionbut then decided to give the audio version a chance since the author himself is reading it. Though he is not a professional narrator, I have to say that I liked his performance and the music that was included.About the story (for those who don't know):A unicorn lives in a wood, as all of them do, and one day finds out that, supposedly, she is the last one. Thus, she starts journeying through the country to find the others. On her way, she meets different people, discovers that the belief in magic is all but lost (she has no sense for time), is being told by a butterfly about the disappearance of her kind because of the Red Bull, gets captured for the Midnight Circus and meets Schmendrick there. This encounter also introduces the reader to another immortal mythical creature, although a less pleasant one. After that, Schmendrick travels with the unicorn, meeting another travel companion some time later. Eventually, they arrive at King Haggard's domain and learn of a witch's curse on the town of Haggsgate as well as the castle and Haggard's pact with the Red Bull. They even meet the creature itself, resulting in Schmendrick unleashing magic to safe the unicorn - which doesn't turn out the way anyone expected, further complicating their quest. Thus, the three live at the castle for quite a while, with Amalthea (the unicorn in human form) and the other two desperately trying to keep the truth from King Haggard and finding the other unicorns. However, with a human body come human emotions so the cruel King and his Red Bull might not be the biggest danger the three have to face.The story is indeed a classic fantasy quest. However, I love the beautiful language as well as the different characters and have never come across another story depicting immortal creatures this way. It's also self-aware of the tropes of the genre (with Prince Lir and his heroic deeds for example) and plays with them nicely.Ultimately, it's a story about good vs evil, friendship and love, what makes us human and what makes a life worth living. All with a spark of the most wonderful magic that brings this enchanted world to life. Truly epic.
