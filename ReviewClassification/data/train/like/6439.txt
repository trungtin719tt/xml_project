Having not read Poe since high school, I figured that I would read a collection of his works. Boy did some of them bring back memories.I must say that Poe holds up for me these years later. What I really noticed this go around was the depth of Poe's writing ability to go deep in the mind's inner recesses.Many say that he is also the father of the English language detective (Murders in the Rue Morgue) story, which I tend to agree with dating before Wilkie Collins' Woman in White and The Moonstone.In any event if you haven't tried Poe, you should.
