This is a beautiful and heart-wrenching love story that touched me very much. Anne, the protagonist, loves Frederick Wentworth but is being persuaded to decline his love. I felt for her and cheered on her throughout the story - and I despised her family for not noticing her quarrels and inner turmoils.This is a story about love, loss, jealousy and pride. It is one of the best romance stories I've ever read, especially because Jane Austen makes you feel for the protagonist in such a way that it's hard to put down the book. I must admit I read this book for the first time a year ago and didn't really understand nor like it. Rereading it today made me realize what a beautiful story it is, and it holds a dear place in my heart from now onwards.
