The perfect mix of character study and courtroom drama,Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evilpaints a fascinating picture of Savannah, Georgia. It's a moody, atmospheric novel that draws you in with its exquisite descriptions and eccentric cast. There are aristocratic snobs and drag queens, punk rock teens and possibly murderous millionaires. It all sounds a bit too good to be true--based on a series of real events from the 1980's-- and maybe it is. But nonetheless, it's wildly entertaining and compulsively readable. I'd recommend the audiobook because there are a few slow moments that I might not have been motivated to read had I been reading it in physical form. Fans of the podcastSerialmight enjoy this one for it's court aspect, with the added bonus of some zany and memorable characters.4 stars
