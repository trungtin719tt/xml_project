In the novel "Island of the Blue Dolphins", the main character is Karana. She is the daughter of the chief of the tribe that lives on the island, "Island of the Blue Dolphins". She also has an older sister, a mom, and a little brother. Her and the others from the tribe hunt and gather their own food, make their clothing, and build their shelter. They are very independent and are the only people who inhabit the island.During this novel, the tribe is visited by foreigners who wish to hunt the otter who live on the island in trade for weapons and gold. The foreigners hunt for a long time and kill nearly all of the otter on the island. When the foriegners are about to leave, instead of trading with the tribe for all of the otter they have killed, they attack the tribe and make a quick get-a-way. During the attack many of the tribe members die, including Karana's father.After the hunters left, food on the island was very scarce and the tribe was forced to move to a neighboring island. While the tribe was leaving, Karana and her brother were left behind. They had to live on the island by themselves while they waited for a boat to come back for them. Karana builds herself a home, fights and tames wild dogs,hunts and makes weapons, and even more.The genre of this novel is adeventure because there is much throughout. The author also uses very descriptive language and uses many sensory details. During most of the story the author has a very lively tone but at times gets very sad. A person who likes adventure would like this book, but I would recommend it to anyone.
