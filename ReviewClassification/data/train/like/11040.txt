Powerful. Unsettling. Originally published in 1940, the story is set in Chicago in the 1930's. A small-time criminal, Bigger Thomas is a young black man on a downhill slope, hurtling toward what you know will be a terrible end. Sullen, resentful, full of fear, he has a deep anger that eventually boils up and over, driving him to the horrific acts that will have him fighting for his life in the judicial system. I felt relieved upon finishing the book, actively glad it was over. I read it with a sense of dread as the events unfolded; it is neither an enjoyable nor an easy read. Nevertheless, it is a classic and presents a view that I had never really considered. I'm not a person who must have a happy ending, but this tale was dark enough to make me want to reach for something more light-hearted for my next book.
