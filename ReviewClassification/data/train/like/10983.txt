Dark. Deceptive. Dysfunctional. Disgusting. Devious.I wanted to read this for so long but the chances of me reading this increased when I saw this in 1001 books to read before you die. I was warned beforehand that this could be yucky at times but would be rewarding if I stick to the end. Since this is a real shorty at 192 pages, I just couldn't DNF it.After really hating the protagonist for first 30% of the book, I suddenly started to like him. I still can't put my finger on what changed but we managed to became friends. Frank has an elder brother Eric who is in some hospital for his illness, so Frank and his father are the only people who lives in house which is far away from the town. What is more shocking is that Frank has no identity i.e. for town people he was some distant relative. Yeah, so a verydysfunctionalfamily.Frank started as adisgusting and deviousteenager for me with his day to day activities which were very repulsive, a heartless boy. But as the story progressed, he told us about his childhood, and of course, the murders that he had committed before he even turned 15. Those were an indication of howdeceptive, patient, well planned, and cruel he could be. As if things couldn't be more dense and bad, story turned reallydarkonce Eric escaped hospital.On the whole this story gives us an insight into Frank's mind and why he was like that. And then there was also a huge revelation at the end which just left md numb for sometime and I kept repeating to myself, no this can't be true. Frank reminds me of Ronnie from Toy Story 1. As Ronnie got a deep satisfaction by breaking and destroying toys, Frank got high on killing insects, animals, and humans.Oh boy, this was a wild, wild ride!
