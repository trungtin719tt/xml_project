-----7/1-----Good Omens is a book about the Antichrist and the end of the world. But don't worry, it's not all sad! In fact, most of it is hilarious. The angel Aziraphale and the demon Crowley are each tasked with finding the Antichrist as a baby and swaying him over to their respective sides; heaven or hell. However, through a misunderstanding they lose the Antichrist and he grows up to be a normal human boy. As a result, Armageddon goes off with a few hitches.It was just as good as I expected it to be! The characters - Aziraphale, Crowley, Anathema, Newt, Shadwell, the Them - were all understandable, real (despite the fact some on that list aren't human), and just the right amount of ridiculous.Shadwell was especially funny. All his lines were read in my mind with a really bad Scottish accent, it made every scene with Shadwell awesome :D-----6/26-----One pressing issue: has anyone here watched Supernatural?The instant Crowley was mentioned I thought of Supernatural. Their characters are so similar!Some quotes in particular stood out as very "Supernatural"-Crowley-like:"Crowley had dark hair and good cheekbones and wore snakeskin shoes"or"Crowley had always known that he would be around when the world ended, because he was immortal and wouldn't have any alternative. But he'd hoped it would be a long way off. Because he rather liked people. It was a major failing in a demon."or"Aziraphale. The Enemy, of course. But an enemy for six thousand years now, which made him a sort of friend."See the similarities? They're glaring me in the face!
