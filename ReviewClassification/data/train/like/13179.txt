I remember finishing the The Summoning, the prequel to The Awakening, last summer and thinking, " I doubt Kelley will be able to top this." Though, apparently she can, as she has proven it with The Awakening.In The Awakening more action and intense drama occurs. As well as major character development. Since, Tori, Chloe, Derek, and Simon's powers began to involve steadily in the book. Also, there was more information told and found out about the Edison Group and werewolves which was fascinating in any case.Derek and Chloe? Yep, their relationship defiantly grew throughout The Awakening and made it one of my favorite parts. I swear I will scream if they don't get together by the end of this series. Since, they are so cute with their bickering and how they always protect each other.Overall, The Awakening will have any fan of the Darkest Powers Trilogy begging for a sequel by the end. I look forward to reading the next book, tremendously. I wish Spring 2010 would come faster.Grade: A+
