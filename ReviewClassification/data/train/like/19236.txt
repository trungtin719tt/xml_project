I can't believe I hadn't found this classic before. What a great read this was! Started off strong on page one, and with the exception of the court scenes, continued strong through out all 850+ pages. Once I got it started, I couldn't put this book down. The author was masterful in laying out the storyline slowly and methodically without wearing it down. Simply loved it.
