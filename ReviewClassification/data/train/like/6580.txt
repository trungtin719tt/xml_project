I just completed reading Brisingr, and I must say that I was very impressed with the plot!To compress all of my thoughts and the plot in to only one word, this has to be it - Unpredictable.Certain events that happened in the book really took me by surprise and I have to applaud Christopher Paolini to even think about such a complex plot. I could hardly guess what might happen in the next few pages, and the only way for me to find out was to keep my head buried deep within its depth.Seriously, any reader who has followed the cycle closely will be in for a big surprise! That, I can promise you!One word of advice: Do not let the horrible movie of the first book tarnish your impression of the cycle. That is probably the last thing you'd like to do. (:I am also very eager for the next and final book to arrive. It was a bit saddening to know that Brisingr is not going to be the last one and us fans will have to go through another few years of torment to find out the ending of Eragon and Saphira.But until then, may your swords stay sharp and let us meet at the gates of Uru'baen for the final blow!(whoo, I managed to write a review that didn't have any spoilers!)
