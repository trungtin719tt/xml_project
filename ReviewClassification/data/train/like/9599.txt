I really enjoyed this the second time around, and maybe even more so as I've matured. I have my favourite ones, but not enough to begin listing them as they all kept my interest much like they withheld the King's.They were short and full of adventure. I felt like I was able to inject myself in them as if I were one of the characters, or at least watching at a close distance as the stories unfolded.My plan was to read one per night before bed, but again, I enjoyed the stories so much I wanted to finish, and I also want to start another book.I love reading books, and listening to them as well!P.S.What about those of you who have read it ... do you have your favourite stories? What are they?
