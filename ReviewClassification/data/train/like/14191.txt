I read this book a very long time ago, so I was really excited when my book club-Diversity in All Forms- decided to read it. It gave me a chance to re-read this book and I didn't remember it at all. I only remembered that it was really good and I originally read it super fast. This book was great! Ellen Hopkins is so good at writing about difficult topics in YA form. I look forward to reading all her books through Diversity in All Forms! If you would like to join in the discussion for this book here is the link:https://www.goodreads.com/topic/show/..."In Crank, Ellen Hopkins chronicles the turbulent and often disturbing relationship between Kristina, a character based on her own daughter, and the "monster," the highly addictive drug crystal meth, or "crank." Kristina is introduced to the drug while visiting her largely absent and ne'er-do-well father. While under the influence of the monster, Kristina discovers her sexy alter-ego, Bree: "there is no perfect daughter, / no gifted high school junior, / no Kristina Georgia Snow. / There is only Bree." Bree will do all the things good girl Kristina won't, including attracting the attention of dangerous boys who can provide her with a steady flow of crank."
