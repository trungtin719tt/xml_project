I read the first hundred pages of Battle Royale and fell asleep. That night I dreamt that I was in The Program. (I remember fleeing a pretty intense gunfight and thinking nonsensically:dammit, at least I'm getting good exercise.)I hardly thought about it until the next evening, when I began to read again and only finished as the sun rose.You cannot know gunfights or car chases until you've readBattle Royale.It's fantastical, it's pulpy, and it's brilliant. I wish it had been written with more realism, but you can't have everything. Perhaps Koushun Takami will write another, some day.
