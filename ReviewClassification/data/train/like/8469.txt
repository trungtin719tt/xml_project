My heart flutters when I'm reading this one because it is the fourth book and I will have to wait for the final book! :D I am so excited what will happen to this series.Leo: He is so useful in this book! He's so awesome. I ship him to Calypso by the way but I don't have faith much in this two since Calypso is in her world.Piper: I'm glad she is moving to help her friends. Her fight with ice-gods are awesome although her relationship to Jason still didn't improve, oh Piper dear, I think you are in the verge of heartbreak.Jason: I'm glad he has a numerous POV in this book! not much to say to him but he is reaching out to his friends.Hazel&amp;Frank: They are so cute! Such a matured couple.Percy&amp;Annabeth: How could i forget this two? Drinking fire, getting help from Bob and Damasen, their love is so strong and i can't wait for book 5 for their happy ending.NICO:Okay, so his name is in caps and bold BECAUSE OF HIS REVELATION sakldjjsfhjsahfgdghjhhdfkghdksjadfhkjasgrf I CANNOT!! I DON'T EVEN HATE OR DISLIKE IT BECAUSE ITS GOOD JUST TO WAY IT IS!!Oh, wait...Reyna - Shes so awkward (well that's expected...) and I'm glad she is not like the other Roman demigods that are narrow-minded.Well, for the whole summary of my review, it is awesome. I can't wait for the book 5. :D
