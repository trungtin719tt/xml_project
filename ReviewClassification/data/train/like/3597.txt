4.5/5 stars.Right from the beginning, I saw that this was going to be one of Irving's quirky masterpieces. So many weird and crazy things were happened as we followed Garp and his mother, Jenny, but each quirky thing I encountered only made me fall in love with the book even more."The World According to Garp" is the story of Garp who got his ear bitten off by a dog as a child. His mother is a nurse who got pregnant through very worrisome measures. The book is the story of Garp from beginning to end, and it's a story that takes you from Vienna to New Hampshire, from generation to generation.Like most of Irving's other novels I loved this book so much! It plays with narratives interestingly as Garp is a writer, and we get to actually read excerpts of his writing (quirky excerpts, I might add!). It's a story about feminism, loss and transsexuality as well as so many other things, and if you're a fan of John Irving it's a must-read!
