I don't think so one can ever read a better Fiction than this. What is it that this book didn't have? You can't set any particular genre for it. It had thrill, mystery, drama, contemporary, historical fiction and what not. Oh....! I forgot to mention one thing. It ended with a sense of moral thought. It showed the way people live their modern day lives. Everybody running in one direction, running after money. Money seems to be everything to all of us. But there's an old sayingMoney can't buy you happiness.and what better example to illustrate it than this book itself. It shows you that happiness is in small things of life such as your family, friends and all that.Just a GREAT BOOK.
