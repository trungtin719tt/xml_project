Now that's what I'm talking about! I've never seen the genre political thriller get mentioned on Goodreads, but here is a prime candidate for this moniker.The translation seems elaborate, genuine, and faithful enough. The places or settings in the book are descriptive. The scenes are well lit.As for the plot, it's quite intricate. Read it and find out! The characterization is not world class, but the author gives the impression that he could write purple prose, if he wanted to.There is blackmail present in the book, and also deciphering of names, there are misdirections galore. Stieg Larsson packed so much in this book, you got to admire his work ethic. Five well earned stars.
