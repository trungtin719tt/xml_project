I enjoyed this reread SO SO SO MUCH!!! I can't believe I was ever petty enough to *vehemently dislike* this novel. Like almost every reread ofThe Infernal DevicesI struggled to fall into the story in the beginning. Alas, I read the second half of the book in one sitting because I REFUSED to put it down. I'm so pleased that I can enjoy these books as an adult much much more than I did as a teen.
