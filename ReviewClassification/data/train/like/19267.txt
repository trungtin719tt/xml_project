I finally finished reading the series. I did not wish to finish book for 2 reasons. First reason is that I had great expectation with Passion and it was not as awesome as I had expected. Second reason is that as annoying as Luce is, I did not wish to end the series and end reading about Daniel.Eventually I could get pass my annoyance for Luce and ended the series.-----------------Ms Kate did a good job with the ending and managed to keep her readers confused of what Lucinda Price really is until the end of the book. Daniel has always been blamed for causing misery to Lucinda and for making her dead every single life they were together. I have never believed that Daniel was capable of being so selfish and sacrificed Lucinda to keep his love for her sated. He was so devastated at every death he witnessed. He even flipped Luce and was rather nasty to her to keep her away in order to keep her alive thus sliced his own heart. I am glad that Daniel is not the angel many readers accused him of.
