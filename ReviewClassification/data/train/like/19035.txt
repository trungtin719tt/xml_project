When I get to heaven, I want to meet Lucy Maud Montgomery! What insight the woman had, and what depth. I loved the first book for its tenderness and vitality, the second for its insight and humor. This book had all of those things, but added something more--tremendous depth. I believe the theme of this book is maturity, and the old characters as well as some new ones gain and display this quality without making the book at all dry or humorless--it is quite the opposite. Of course, there are other themes as well, not the least of which is love. But I wouldn't spoil the book for you--just read it! (P.S. This book helped me to realize that the movie "Anne of Green Gables: The Sequel," which I have loved all my life, must now be sold. I will never be able to enjoy it the same way again, knowing what the story was meant to be!)
