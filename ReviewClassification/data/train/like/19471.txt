What a wonderful book and why have I not read it before? It reminded me ofThe Boy in the Striped Pajamasboth for its remarkable story and the quality of the writing.The book is written as a retelling by the author of his Grandfather's early life, more specifically "one week in 1942, the first week of the year, the week he met my grandmother, made his best friend and killed two Germans." During that week the Grandfather, Lev, was just 17 years old and living in Leningrad which was enduring the Nazi siege of 1942. Various events cause him to meet up with Kolya, a Russian deserter who is only a few years older in years but much more in experience. Together they set out on a ridiculous quest and witness many of the awful atrocities that occurred during that war.The characters of Lev and Kolya are what makes this book. Kolya is by turns funny and infuriating but is always lovable. Their dialogue is frequently hilarious which prevents the story from becoming overwhelmingly sad and horrifying. The history was amazing - how those poor people survived starvation during the siege! I had not come across "library candy" before. The will to live brings about some incredible invention.A sad, sad ending with a sweet epilogue. I have another favourite book:)
