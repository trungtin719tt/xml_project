This is a pretty famous book, but not one that's particularly been on my radar. But I was listening to my favorite podcast as of late, Lore, and there was an episode about this story, of the 1893 Chicago World's Fair and H. H. Holmes the murderer who used the venue to lure in vulnerable victims. It fascinated me, and it reminded me of this book I'd heard of. So I checked it out, and I'm SO glad I did. This is definitely one of my favorite reads of 2015.Now I know this book won't be for everyone. If you don't find the politics behind and construction of the fair to be interesting, then you won't like virtually half of this book. But the historical aspects as well as the drama and intrigue behind the fair's regulations, development and questionable success was really fascinating. Plus there are so, so many things that we have today--inventions, historical figures, songs and other works of art--that came to fame from this fair. It's so interesting. And I almost felt the fair had more life, had been more fleshed out by the author, than the chapters revolving around Holmes' methods and murders.It's historical non-fiction/true crime at its best. And I will definitely be checking out more books by this author. 5/5 stars.
