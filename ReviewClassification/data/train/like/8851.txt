This book boasts a fabulous collection of work's by Emily Dickinson. Admittedly, I didn't enjoy all of them, hence the four stars given, but the majority of the poem's were beautifully written, as well as being rather thought provoking."He fumbles at your spiritAs players at the keysBefore they drop full music on;He stuns you by degrees,Prepares your brittle substanceFor the ethereal blow,By fainter hammers, further heard,Then nearer, then so slowYour breath has time to straighten.Your brain to bubble cool,-Deals one imperial thunderboltThat scalps your naked soul"
