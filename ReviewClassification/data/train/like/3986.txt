I remember this book being devastatingly sad to me when I was a child. Upon re-reading as an adult, I got misty-eyed, but was not nearly as upset. I'm not sure if that's because I was more prepared for what would happen, if it was just a by-product of being a grown up, or if it has anything to do with seeming a bit old-fashioned now that the story is nearly 100 years old.InThe Velveteen Rabbit, we follow a stuffed bunny from the time he enters a young boy's nursery one Christmas morning, through different seasons filled with play and growing love. But does the rabbit have what it takes to become Real? Is he loved enough?This may not have been quite as magical as I remembered, but it's still a lovely story with a message that hits the heart.
