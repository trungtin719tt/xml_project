Three things I've learned from reading Tom Sawyer:1. Marbles are an acceptable form of currency. So provided I didn't throw out my set when I moved, I'm rich and can whitewash as many fences as I want.2. Boys are dicks to the girls they like.This is a lie.This is the more likely scenario.3. Books read better when you're not being forced to read them.Next on my required reading list isThe Great Gatsby. Mother have mercy...
