Though I've grown old, the bell still rings for me, as it does for all who truly believe.4.5I watchedThe Polar Expressthe movie as soon as it came out. And it became one of my favorite Christmas movies. And now I finally decided to read (well, listen actually) the book. And the book was just as magical as the movie (even though I do have to admit that I liked the movie a little bit more)One more thing I want to mention is that Liam Neeson did an amazing job narrating the book. If you haven't already read this book, I suggest listening to his audiobook.
