Soo, I have heard a lot of wonderful things about this book and about this great ending. I am a huge fan of Agatha Christie stories and they are the "Perfect" cozy mysteries for me. Whenever I read a cozy mystery, I end up comparing it to Christie novels.My personal favorites areAnd Then There Were None,Murder on the Orient Express. If you haven't read these, go ahead and give them a try.So as this book is counted in top 1000 mystery books, I definitely wanted to be ahead of Christie or should I say Poirot and solve this one on my own.I started this book with determined air and put on my thinking cap with vigor.Was I able to guess the ending?No chance in hell.There were few smaller mysteries along the way and some of them I was able to guess correctly.I had a lot of theories and suspicions for the main ending but none of them came to be true.Around 90% of the book, things started falling into place and my heart started beating faster.The beauty of the ending is, it's all very simple and left meIf you have read this one, were you able to guess the ending well in advance?
