Definitely an enjoyable read,if Tomorrow Comestells us the story of Tracey Whitney; how her life changed drastically in the course of 24 hours, and how she went from a simple young girl to a diabolical con artist.Spanning over America and Europe, Tracey's life is a memoir worth reading, of love, lust, despair and finally an unshakable will. And it is this strength of character, and her unflinching attitude in the face of life's 'lemons' that endears her to the readers.If not one of Sheldon's best works, it definitely comes close.
