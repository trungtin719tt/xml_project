It has been debated whether Shakespeare's Merchant of Venice is anti-semitic or whether he is trying to call attention to their plight in his time. Many modern readers lean toward the latter pointing to Shylock's profound speech in the trial scene (do I not bleed when you cut me?). It's up to the reader to form their own opinion because it's hard to know what Shakespeare was thinking 400 years after the fact.From a pure readability standpoint, I thought the play was very good, one of Shakespeare's best so far for me. Probably the best group of characters of any of his plays that I have read. I really liked the strength of the female characters, especially Portia, who was very resourceful and ends up being the foil for Shylock where, in the courtroom scene, she delivers her famous "quality of mercy" speech.4.5 stars
