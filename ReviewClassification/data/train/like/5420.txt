Confession: This is one of my favorite books and I've probably read it 20-25 times, I usually read it at least once a year.The first book in the Foundation series (this series won the Hugo award for best all-time series) as we follow the path of Foundation set out by Hari Seldon and his psychohistory.Galaxy spanning - huge cast of characters - hundreds of years are covered - most epic, most awesome.Highest possible recommendationIf you're one of the five people left who haven't read this book just go do it...now
