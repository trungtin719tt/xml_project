I love the object lessons in this book. We use them all the time.If my bright child comes home from school and says, "Mom, John says I'm an idiot." I say, "Well, are you an idiot?" He'll smile &amp; say "no". Then I'll remind him that the 'dots only stick if you let them'.Also, whenever people ask who my hero is, I tell them Lucia. I know she's fictional, but I want to be just like her and not let the dots nor the stars stick!Kid's books are so much fun. :)
