"You Are Special" continues to be one of my favorite books. The main idea of the story is to show children that they are wonderful, special individuals... regardless of how the world evaluates them; which relates to the idea of everybody being different. The main character, Punchinello, is not as pretty, smart, or talented as the others in his community, yet in the end he discovers that what others think does not matter. In this Religion genre text Eli, the woodcarver, represents the creator of man and teaches Punchinello that He loves him because of his differences.If I were to use this book in my classroom I would present it in a way that exemplifies the topic of individualism, rather than Religion. I believe it is a fabulous lesson on judgement for children of all ages. I also believe that students of elementary ages can relate and interact with the story because of the stickers, or dots, the Wemmicks are given for their appearance. Students today are praised and assessed with stickers also.Max Lucado, the author, portrays his Religion through every piece of literature he writes, making him one of Christianity's most popular authors. In this specific story, Lucado connects the message of individualism to being a 'son of God' exceptionally well. The story of Punchinello imitates the idea that God loves us even though we make mistakes and have flaws!
