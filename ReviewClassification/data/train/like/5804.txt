I 'finally' read this book - the 50th Anniversary Edition- THANK YOU for the book Loretta!!! I'm sorry it took me so long to read it!!!!Interesting timing for me, too, having just read "NW" by Zadie Smith, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie- and a couple ofJames Baldwin books recently---plus, yesterday was Martin Luther King's day.African identity, nationalism, decolonization, racism, sexism, competing cultural systems, languages -and dialogue, social political issues have been in my space!!I didn't know what to expect...."may be Africa's best-loved novel...For so many readers around the world, it is Chinua Achebe who opened up the magic casements of African fiction" ----by Kwame Anthony Appiah.After I read this book -- joining thousands and thousands of others around the world feeling disturbed &amp; conflicted when I read lines like this:"I will not have a son who cannot hold up his head in the gathering of the clan. I would sooner strangle him with my own hands. And if you stand staring at me like that, he swore, Amadiora will break your head for you"....... I wanted to 'also' read more about Kwame Anthony Appiah.... Who taught philosophy and African American studies at Yale and Harvard. He helped give me a broader understanding of this book.He studied ethics around the world. Things he had to say about "kindness to strangers", made sense to me.It is not for 'us' to save the poor and starving, but up to their own governments. Nation-states must assume responsibility for their citizens.In "Things Fall Apart", western culture is portrayed as arrogant and ethnocentric. Their culture was vulnerable to the western civilization.With so much sadness and tragedy in his culture, growing up as he did in .. China Achebe ( who wrote in English), was amazing!!!!!He continues to have influence on other African novelists today..... inspiring writers around the world. Readers too!Never too late to read "Things Fall Apart"
