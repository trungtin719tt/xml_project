Splendidly delightful! This is not quite the same Anne we first met in Green Gables but a maturing and horizons-broadened Anne. The new characters she meets while away at college add depth to the ongoing story; but her connections to Avonlea remain ever strong. I love Davy's letters describing his many plights. I positively love these books even more as an adult now!
