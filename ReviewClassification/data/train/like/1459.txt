Like I said with the Hobbit, I appreciate so much of what Tolkin has done for fantasy and the true imagination of this world and the characters is incredible.I just don't like Tolkin's pacing. There are so many thrilling scenes and the characters are phenomenal, but there's SO MUCH sitting around and talking. It's very much, go here, talk for a while, go here, meet someone to and talk so more, go here, encounter a creature, talk... again.I love some scenes and other times, I felt like it was a complete chore to get through this book. The thing is, a lot of the more boring scenes didn't even feel like they were furthering the plot, they just sat around for nothing!Anyway, I'm really glad I read this book and will be continuing on with the next one soon, I'm just not a fan of Tolkin's pacing.
