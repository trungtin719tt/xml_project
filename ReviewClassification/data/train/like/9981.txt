I have read many fantasy books and I can say with certainty that this is one of those stories that stand out. Sabriel is a very unique, interesting, complex story. Like many other fantasy books, it takes a little time to understand what is going on and really get into the story, but when that happens, you will most likely take a deep breath, dive in and refuse to come out before the end.Sabriel is a young girl but she is an adult inside. A strong female character is a gem! She is not annoying or dense and she understand what it means to have a responsibility.This book has great characterization. Touchstone, Maggot...all are very unique and interesting and memorable. The magic system rocks! If you like Necromancy, you have to read this.Is this a romantic book? Not really, this a is very intense fantasy book and romance isn't a primary element.Is there a very beautiful love hidden in the pages? Hell yeah! A grown up kind of love!In my opinion, this is a dark fantasy. Certain parts completely took my breath away. You just have to imagine and put yourself in Sabriel's place and you will successfully scare the hell out of yourselves.I really enjoyed reading this book. I may not remember all the details after a long time but this book is unique enough that I will never confuse it with something else and I just need a few hints to remember it all.Are you looking for an intense, rich, fascinating fantasy book? Try this.
