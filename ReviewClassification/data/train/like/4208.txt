Picture this,I am 7,its Christmas and all the gifts are wrapped and under the tree.I could see through the wrapping paper a faint outline of the cover of A Light in the Attic.I begged.I screamed.I was not allowed to open the present even though I knew what it was.But... I still have the original copy and read it to my son and because of my harrowing experience I love this book even more.
