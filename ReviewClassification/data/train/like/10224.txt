A walk down memory lane. Although I have a whole bunch of new books to read, I felt like grabbing a childhood favorite from my stacks tonight. The first book in the "Little House" series introduces readers to Laura Ingalls, her Ma &amp;Pa, and sisters, Mary and Carrie living in their log home in the "big woods" of Wisconsin.The thirteen chapters in this book serve as vignettes of what life was like for settler families, the roles and responsibilities of each family member, the customs and teachings that had such an impact on a little girl and shape her to be a grown woman. I always felt a connection to Laura Ingalls right down to her brown hair. Intertwined with these chapters are stories of several family members misadventures that provide chuckles and lessons from beginning to end.It would be terrible for me to overlook the wonderful illustrations from Garth Williams that accompany the author's text. I dare say that without them as child of 9 (the age of my "discovery "), the story might not have had as much impact.I would definitely recommend to the young and young at heart.
