This third book in Ben Peller's "To Live" trilogy is both bizarre and brilliant. Shawn Michals is on an island, dealing with both his past and an amazing woman, Bina, who challenges him to not only come to grip with his past but also lead the people of the island into the future. Given what's going on in the world, this book and "The Acceptance" might just influence generations. It certainly has influenced me.
