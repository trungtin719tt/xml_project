I saw a few reviews, before I read this book, saying it was the bestAgatha Christiethey had read and I think I agree! I raced through it in a few hours though still making sure I absorbed every fact and every clue.Not that it did me any good. I had plenty of ideas as to who the murderer might be but in the end none of them were correct. Poirot kept his secrets right to the end and only then did things become clear. It was actually an amazing conclusion to a really excellent story.Thoroughly enjoyable and yes, one of the best Christie novels I have read.
