Mistress Suffragette follows the plight of Penelope as she struggles with the societal pressure, the feelings of dissatisfaction and her own dreams and desires to be seen as more then "someone's wife".Beautifully written this novel drums up reminiscence of Jane Austen and the Bronte sisters, but set in America we get the story from the other side of the pond - one much less discussed in modern society but no less important.Diana Forbes has managed to create a world of characters so brilliantly intelligent and real that you feel you're taking every step of the journey with Penelope, experiencing her ups and down along with her and desperately hoping that she can achieve all that she hopes to.Forbes brings you full force into Penelope's world, nothing feels forced or contrived, instead it feels as though written by someone who lived this very life, leaving you turning page after page hungry for more of her story. All of the surrounding characters are incredibly authentic and genuine.I would recommend this to any fan of classical literature, and it also does a wonderful job of still feeling relevant in today's society. A genuinely exciting and beautifully written novel.
