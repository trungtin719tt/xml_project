Guy don't need no sense to be a nice fella. Seems to me sometimes it jus' works the other way around. Take a real smart guy and he ain't hardly ever a nice fella.Well, fuck. I never knew a short book could drain me emotionallythismuch.Of Mice and Menis a book that I think everyone should read, at least once. I read it yesterday, in one sitting, and I still can't stop thinking about it. Without a doubt, this book became one of my favorite classics.Of Mice and Menis a story about two men, George and his simple-minded friend - Lennie, who have nothing in this world except for two things: each other and a dream that one day they will have a part on this earth that they will be able to call home. And I think that this is all a person should know going into this book. I went into it not knowing anything about what it is about, and it surprised the heck out of me. I don't think I've ever read a book that was just soreal, and so heartbreaking at the same time. Even though it was short, every single character felt so realistic. But not just the characters.Everythingfelt realistic. Also, Steinbeck's writing style was so beautiful. I could picture the home that George was describing so nicely.This truly is one of those books that will stay in my thoughts for a long time, and that I will go back to and re-read it many times.
