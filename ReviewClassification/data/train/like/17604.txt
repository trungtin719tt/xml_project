Stupid people read books because Oprah says so. Other stupid people won't read a book just because Oprah picked it to be part of her club. The second group of stupid people think they are very smart though, and they are usually pretentious windbags who say very stupid shit but with big words that people are supposed to be impressed with. The people in the second group will never read this awesome book, and I don't feel sorry for them because they don't deserve it.(A note: Of the second group they will also whine when a book from Oprah Book Club 2.1 (ie., the second incarnation of the book club which began with John Steinbeck'sEast of Eden, and was in it's 2.0 manifestation only going to be for dead authors, but then morphed into 2.1 to include such titles asThe Road, andMeasure of a Man) they want to buy is now affixed with the Oprah wrapper or sticker. They will now whine about the little blemish in the same way they whine when the book they now want to read has just been made into a movie and only comes with a movie cover. In both cases these people are bandwagon jumpers but don't want to seem like bandwagon jumpers and by buying the new edition of the book they will be seen as no different from the ignorant masses they so deeply despise. Again they deserve what they get, especially since everyone knows that you can goto a used bookstore and buy an old cover, and if you really need to lie to yourself and everyone around you, you can claim that the 1960's beat up mass-market copy of Steinbeck you bought was really bought by you in a much better condition when you were thirteen, and now you have worn the book down by your constant reading of it, and because of that you know the book soooooo much better than anyone else alive).
