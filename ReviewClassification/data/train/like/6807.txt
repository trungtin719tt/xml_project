JIMINY CRAP!!!!!!!!! THIS BOOK WAS SO FREAKING GOOD.And those were understatements. EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO KNOWS HOW TO READ MUST READ THIS!!! Geezz. I cried a lot.Half way through the book, I decided I would download the osp for the movie. And while reading, I was listening to the song over and over again. It didn't bother me. It actually made me appreciate the book more. A long time a go, after reading The Choice, I swore to myself I will never read a Nicholas Sparks's book again until my friend told me this was good. I borrowed and put MAGYK aside to read this.And I will never regret it.I told you, half way till end, I was listening to Miley Cyrus sing 'When I look at you'. I don't even like her but the song was great. I remembered going inside my room when I reached chapter 30 because I knew something will happen and will bring me to tears. Then I read Chapter 31. I cried so so much. And when i finished crying, I'll hear the chorus of the song, and read more touching scenes and I will cry again. I repeated that process over and over and over again. It's just so sad that this book isn't mine..haha I didn't cry over a book ever that way. Well, I cried when I read New Moon when Edward left Bella but this was different. It's so touching and I felt my world falling apart as I read. Its simply beautiful. I love it. I love the characters especially Ronnie's brother. He's so funny and adorable. I wouldn't miss watching this film.Please. Read this. Not reading this would be like never having to taste chocolate. Or never having to see colors. This book is brilliant.
