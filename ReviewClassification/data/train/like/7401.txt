I didn't know exactly what to expect, when starting this classic treatise. As it turns out, the book is very accessible. Machiavelli turns out to have a very pragmatic, and practical approach to governing. One of the most important recommendations he has, is that a governing prince should keep his subjects happy. At least, don't do too many things to make them unhappy. If a governor finds himself with a population that is unhappy with him, then it is very vulnerable to attacks from the outside.What also struck me, was Machiavelli's vast knowledge of history. So much of the book recalls historical events from all over Europe. It is just amazing, how much detail he has learned about history and historical figures over the centuries of the Middle Ages.
