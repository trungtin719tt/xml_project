This is one ofthose books...you know, one of those that sits on your shelf, looking pretty and making you feel a bit less of the uncultured swine that you really are. At least, it eased my guilt a little bit just to look at my bookshelves and see it nestled in with all of my other unread classics.What's funny is that this was considered to be silly old romance back in the day of Austen. The fact that a woman wrote it was nearly a guarantee that it was rubbish. And then there's me....when I started reading, the first forty pages were really hard for me to get into. I read very slowly, and had to re-read quite a few phrases for me to understand them. Here's one that made me giggle, and I'm still not sure what it means:They must retrench; that did not admit of a doubt.What!? I suppose in the context it was given, it meant that they needed to rethink their strategy, or consider something from a different angle. But that's a little idea of what to expect. For this reader of almost exclusively modern popular fiction, the introduction and set up of Anne's life was hard won.However, once the story takes off and I began to get sucked in to this extraordinary woman's life, I was completely captivated. This novel could just as equally been called Pride and Prejudice. Anne's family is hard to swallow. Her father is pompous, vain, and completely self absorbed. Her sister Elizabeth (haha) is basically the same. Her other sister Mary is a loud, complaining, selfish hypochondriac who's favorite pastime is telling Anne how much better she is than anyone else. They think so much of themselves and so little of Anne. I wanted to jump inside my reader and knock them down a peg, force them to see the wonderful person that they are so dismissive of! And they aresodismissive of Anne's kindness and good will. One of the things that struck me, over and over again, is how gracious Anne is, how much she takes from her family, and yet what really affects Anne's happiness is not her undeserving family, but Frederick Wentworth and their broken engagement.Eight years ago, Anne and Captain Wentworth fell in love and got engaged to be married. But Anne waspersuadedto break off the engagement by a close friend. At that time, Wentworth was not titled (and never does receive one), but is also not rich and well known. Well, we all know how important social standing was back then. And though Anne cares not a bit, her immaturity shows when she accedes to the wishes of other people and tells Wentworth that she can no longer marry him. It is to be her biggest regret and just the thing that lowers her spirits.Now, circumstances arise that force Anne and Wentworth to be in close proximity to each other. Not once or twice, but for weeks on end. But "the bloom of youth" has now left the twenty seven year old Anne, and she has come to terms with forever being in the background, watching her love from afar, forever pining and lonely.Their families and friends seem to flutter around them, causing their own kind of crazy. But all I could see was Anne and Wentworth, in their own kind of dance. At first cautious and reticent, and OH! It just broke my heart. Jane Austen is a master story teller, using such subtleties to suck the reader in to her world. Somehow, she makes it easy to take the sides of both Anne and Wentworth and my heart broke for each of them. Anne's affections are more apparent than Wentworth's, but the man was inlovewith her!"They had no conversation together, no intercourse but what the commonest civility required. Once so much to each other! Now nothing!....Now they were as strangers; nay, worse than strangers, for they could never become acquainted It was a perpetual estrangement."Jane Austen must have had an amazing insight into the human psyche, an uncanny ability to judge someone's character very well. And then she put it down into WORDS that I feel so privileged to read. Body language and the force of character of acquaintances suddenly becomes apparent...things that I never would have thought, let alone voiced! But when I read how Austen put things, it all suddenly makes sense!"Warmth and enthusiasm did captivate her still. She felt that she could so much more depend upon the sincerity of those who sometimes looked or said a careless or a hasty thing, than of those whose presence of mind never varied, whose tongue never slipped..."Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice, shame on me... Seems as if Austen never had that problem."She had been used before to feel that he could not be always quite sincere, but now she saw insincerity in everything..."Oh, my Mr. Darcy may have a contender in Captain Wentworth for my affections! He is, in my mind, a kind man, but also stern and somewhat vengeful. He still wants Anne but his pride and hers prevents them from simply talking to each other. Instead of feeling Anne out and trying again to make his feelings known, he tries to make Anne jealous by flirting and seeming to court some of Anne's friends! Urg...bad move there, buddy!But he does redeem himself. Swoooooooon! I thought that Darcy's "I love you...most ardently..." speech was one of my favorite lines ever. But oh, OH! Wentworth! (slightly spoiler-ish quote if you're NOT expecting this to end happily)"I can listen no longer in silence. I must speak to you by such means as are within my reach. You pierce my soul. I am half in agony, half hope. Tell me not that I am too late, that such precious feelings are gone for ever. I offer myself to you again with a heart even more your own than when you almost broke it, eight years and a half ago. Dare not say that man forgets sooner than woman, that his love has an earlier death. I have loved none but you. Unjust I may have been, weak and resentful I have been, but never inconstant. You alone have brought me to Bath. For you alone I think and plan. Have you not seen this? Can you fail to have understood my wishes? I had not waited even these ten days, could I have read your feelings, as I think you must have penetrated mine.And if that doesn't speak to the romantic soul, then you just don't have one. My heart was so full, my eyes teared up, and my inner romantic was completely sated.[image error]"/&gt;(I edited this pic in, because it needed a visual ;)If you're waiting to read this, just make sure you do, eventually. This really is a must read for any Austen fans, for any romance lovers, for anyone who enjoys a beautifully worded story, one that makes you think and makes your heart go pitter pat. I put this down with a sigh and a smile on my face...and immediately went out to get the movie ;) It's a story I will never get enough of!
