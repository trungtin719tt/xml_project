Just read this for the first time. There's a story here, behind the story.My two grandsons, ages eight and four, 'found' this book, but not on the children's bookshelf which I keep for them at my house, but on MY bookcase squeezed between a book on dinosaurs (also mine) and my small collection of Nancy Drew mysteries. They ran to me with it, ordered me to sit down and read it for them. I complied.Well, they'd both seen the movie - the older one had seen it several times - but they sat on either side of me, watching me read. Yes, they sometimes watch ME to make sure I say all the words. The four-year old knew the book by heart, having had it read to him in pre-school. I had no idea what it was about, but commented on how 'dark' the illustrations were."The movie is dark, too," commented my older grandson.When I read the part about 'believing,' the younger one said, "You HAVE to believe.""Yes, to hear the bell," the older one added.It was a charming moment on a dark afternoon reading the dark pages of this wonderful, short, but striking book. Glad they found it.Glad I read it. :D
