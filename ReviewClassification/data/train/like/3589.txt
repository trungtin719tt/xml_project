This was a hoot to listen to as an audio book &amp; very well narrated byNeil Hunt. This is the mother of every pirate story I've ever read or seen, I think. The language was incomprehensible at times, on purpose, as even Jim Hawkins wasn't sure he always got the right of it. If I ever hear "15 men on a dead man's chest" again, I'll scream.;)The characters were great, of course. Long John Silver is quite the rogue &amp; Jim is the boy we all wish we were. Somehow our extraneous adventures never turned out half so well, unfortunately. Still, it was fun hoping.I read this as a kid &amp; it was great to go through it again after all these years. Definitely a classic.
