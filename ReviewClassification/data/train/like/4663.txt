This is a yet-to-be-completed partial draft of a novel portraying Twilight from Edward's perspective. I have read (more like devoured) the 264 pages that Stephenie Meyer posted on her website. I love them, flaws (which were not too many considering it's a rough draft) and all. It would be really disappointing if Edward's story ended where it does. He was always the most intriguing character to me, and the story thus far explains so much of his words and actions that puzzled me before. It's a bonus that he can read minds, so we not only know now what he was thinking, but also the thoughts of those around him. I've been surprised to read just how much he knew about the future and how early he knew it, thanks to Alice. Makes me want to slap my forehead and go, Duh! No wonder he did what he did! Stephenie is the only person in the universe who can guide us on this journey into the depths of Edward, and I sincerely hope she continues to write this story, and not let her faith in humanity be ruined by a few shameless and untrustworthy people.
