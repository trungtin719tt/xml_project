I enjoyed the story very much. I am pretty sure I must have read it in school when I was much younger, but did not remember the story at all. The dog's name, Rontu, did seem familiar. I suspect that one of my daughters read it in grade school.Imagine being completely alone on an island for 18 years. The story is based on a real person and there was documentation about the time that she lived there all alone, until she was taken to the Mission at Santa Barbara, in California. Mr. O'Dell told a very compelling story of a strong young Indian woman and her animal friends.
