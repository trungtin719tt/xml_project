I've read the first maybe twenty pages or so a few times now. On first glance, it blew me away. The world around me (narrow, quiet stacks in my beloved local library) was steeped in the prose. It was a little bit (well, more than a little bit) like Wallace Stevens' "the reader became the book"- which is as spine-tinglingly accurate a description of great reading, let alone great writing, as I'm apt to find.Going back, the feeling has been a little diminished after first blush but not changed- transformed, evolved, swerved.I want to read this book. There are dozens of books I could say that for (up it goes on the potential shelf with all the others, with a click) but I'm entranced, flabbergasted, engrossed.I guess I really am a Modernist at heart. The blurb on the front says in auspicious tones that with this magisterial translation Herr Musil takes his rightful place among the (to me) awesome peaks of Joyce, Mann, Fafka, etc.World enough and time, world enough and time....***After having more time on my hands this year than I thought, I've gotten about 200-300 pages in, not quite within striking distance of the end (1200, that'shundredpages, both volumes included) but it is so...rich.Exquisite scene-setting, characters are enticing and subtly multi-dimensional, probing, eloquent and erudite philosophizing, the plot is admittedly rather slow but engrossing as all hell.The thing was, it's almost TOO good, like, well-nigh insurmountable. I had to put it down, this is a book that needs to be savoured bit by bit, sentence by sentence, moment by moment...It was like eating a piece of fresh tiramisu; complex deep flavours and creamy sweetness. Then a couple more pieces, then more, and then dozens....I couldn't take it any more. I had to put it aside.Everything's set to go, though, I could pick it back up again any time and go right back into the world of the novel. I can do that, interestingly enough, and one day I will.
