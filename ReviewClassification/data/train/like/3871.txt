I could be wrong but I can only think any one or two star ratings come from offending the reader's beliefs. I can't think it has anything to do with the book itself. The story is thrilling and page turning, the character fully real and human, the events can break your heart, and the the writing is fluid and poetic. Not difficult at all unless you like your reading so easy you never have to pause for any sort of thought. This is a book for lovers of literature, writing, and profound spiritual truths. All my thumbs up,
