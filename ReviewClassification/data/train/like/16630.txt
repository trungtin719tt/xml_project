Just finished reading this fantastic memoir for the second time after having enjoyed it the first go round over a decade ago. Knowing what was coming down the track, this reading was even more satisfying, as I could slow down and savor her words instead of rushing ahead.I thought that everybody in the world had already read this but am in a new book club where my husband and I were the only ones lucky enough to have already done so. What a treat it was to revisit this after 10 years!Walls had a truly dysfunctional childhood, but knew that she was the apple of her alcoholic father's eye. The love from him, her siblings, and her own plucky self-determination certainly gave her a path through some very bizarre circumstances and into a successful adulthood. Having her father take her hand and stick it through the bars of a cheetah cage at the zoo and being instructed by her mother to simply cut off the maggot-loaded portions of unrefrigerated food and eat the portion that had not yet been touched, Walls learned wonder and pragmatism from her oddball parents.This book is loaded with anecdotes, one after another, full of amazing and horrifying and beautiful moments. As a parent myself, my loathing of the parents in the story climbed and climbed, but because this memoir was told from the perspective of Walls as a little girl first, I also fell in love with her mom and dad just a little bit. She narrates the tale in real time, and as she becomes a teenager with more open eyes, her disappointment in these parents becomes palpable.One could say that this is a rags to riches story, but the treasure was always there - despite the poverty, they were rich in the love they had for each other.
