Elena is a werewolf, and the only female werewolf in the world at that. She is turned werewolf against her will and knowledge by a person very close to her. Mad and unable to forgive, she tries to escape her pack to find her place in the human world. When she finally thinks she is settled in her human ("normal") life, the pack calls for her help and she can't say "no." When she is back, she faces her past and at last realizes what she really wants and needs.I am a huge fan of currently popular urban fantasy genre and I believe "Bitten" is one of the better books in this genre. It starts a little slow, but picks up tremendously in latter part of the book when werewolf world is unraveled. Armstrong is extremely skillful at creating a totally believable mythology. In fact by the end of the book, the weres felt completely real to me. This story has a great deal of romance, mystery, and action in it, but most of all it is a book about self-discovery.Needless to say, I will continue reading the rest of the books in the "Women of the Otherworld" series, although this book can be read as a stand-alone novel with no loose ends or cliff-hangers.P.S. Due to recently uncovered additional evidence of Clay's fabulousness (specifically, him being a virgin hero), I am upgrading this book from 4 to 5 stars.
