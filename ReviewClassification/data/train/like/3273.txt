This is a short but oh so beautiful a book! I love birds, though seagulls are not always the most popular of species. I have my own seagull who awaits me every morning, hovering around nearby perching posts like roofs, telegraph poles and street lamps for any cast off cat food I put out for him and his name (given by me) is Cedric. (Don't ask me why, it just came into my mind when he first began to visit) Cedric may even be female but I don't think so. He is down for his breakfast before I have even returned inside.I have arrived late to Jonathan Livingston Seagull but oh so well worth the wait for it is a magical read. It is about the dreams, hopes, search for freedom, perseverance, confidence, sense of achievement, ambition, humility and respect of one young seagull. His parents and flock do not understand him but although he respects his parents and elders he never wavers in his personal goals. I love the book and have already ordered the DVD and the CD of the beautiful music and lyrics sung by Neil Diamond. I recommend it highly.
