I read this for my English Language and Lit class. Not disappointed. The book delivers an intriguing plot with interesting characters and a narrative that flows throughout the book easily.Blanche's character truly resembles a moth; she is fragile. She also has mental delusions which add another dimension to the play.Moreover, the characters complement the story. The way the story unfolds is like a violin that keeps getting louder throughout the book and at a moment in the book the strings break!Reading this play, you will not be disappointed, the book handles the issues of alcoholism, delusion and patriarchal society in a marvellously devilish way.
