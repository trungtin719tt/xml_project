I re-read this book after twenty-five years. I loved it at the time and now, the whole concept is futile and nothing. Nicholas, Alison, the island, etc. Pure words. I wonder what I was feeling then? I know that times change things but I'm amazed at such a radical change here, after all John Fowles is a wonderful writer. I especially loved his novella "The Ebony Tower. I guess we are all subject to change depending on our own particular circumstances.
