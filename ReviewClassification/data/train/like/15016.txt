I think rereading Faefever gave me an emotional aneurysm. Nothing works anymore.In book 3 of the Fever series, Mac comes to realize that all the men in her life are trash and she needs to branch out; place some eggs in different baskets, if you will. KMM deepens some of her old characters (Inspector Jayne, Dani, etc) and brings in a few new ones (like Christian MacKeltar, my personal darling). This is all very nice and soothing.Why did I lose ten years of my life reading this book? Well.KMM likes to hold on to nearly all of her cards until the end of book 5,Shadowfever. This works out well because she drops enough hints along the way to keep her readers hot and bothered, but still smacks them in the face with the final big reveal. I think you'd be hard-pressed to guess the series ending.But rereading while holding all the answers already is a whole different matter. The series is headed in a certain..........direction....... and seeing all the clues and plot points that push Mac towards that point is REALLY stressful.But it's worth it! I mean,do you really love a book series if reading it doesn't put you through hell and back?
