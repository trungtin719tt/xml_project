This story gets directly to the point. Coetzee is quick to take us from point A to point B with as little embellishment as possible. The short and compulsively readable "Disgrace" revolves around a professor who has fallen from his status at a South African university, then the tables are turned and he finds himself falling even further down the chute, becoming the victim of sudden violence. Misogyny is thence explored, as is morbidity. It's "The Human Stain" meets "Saturday." (The former is a classic but the latter a piece of s***--- and this one is quite good). It has a character perhaps as modern as Ian McEwan's (more humane, more of a randy old gentleman) but the antihero this time around does learn his lesson: Don't mess with the countryfolk, city boy!The symbolism is dark; the pace exciting. A modernday clash (in a particularly distant region) of societies, genders and races. Very few books succeed in packing such a wallop in as few pages (220) as this one.
