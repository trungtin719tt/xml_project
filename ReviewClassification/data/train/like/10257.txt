I seriously wonder if Peter S. Beagle has Synesthesia. His choice of adjectives is beautiful and downright tasty. Sounds have color and texture, it's as if he was able to show people what it would be like to walk into a Van Gogh painting and live inside it.His plot is not as it seems, at first appearing cliche (you may find yourself thinking "This is like the start of hundreds of fairy tales I've read as a kid") but you will be delightfully proven wrong. His characters are unique and experience much growth and development throughout the book.To read this book is a unique experience. It was the first Peter Beagle book I picked up at a friends recommendation. If you've never read any of his works, make sure this is the first. After readingThe Last UnicornI ran out and bought four other books of his, none of which held a candle to this one, but they are just as satisfyingly written.As a side note, apparently there is an animated movie based on this book. I haven't seen it myself, but I hesitate to. I think I just want to let the book stand on its own in my imagination.
