"He has a way with words" is probably a trite expression but it certainly applies to E.M. Forster. His writing is fluid, beautiful, and his stories well thought out. This book, written in 1910 certainly reflects the style of authors of that time but Forster is readable while some others at the turn of the 20th century appear stilted and formal.The book, set in the time of the publication, is the story of England at the highest point of its hopes but also reveals the one word upon which the country was based.......class. The distinction between those with money, property or titles and "all the rest" was the accepted norm and it plays a major part in this story of two sisters whose lives take different paths. Forster hoped for a class free England and the image of the house Howard's End symbolizes the stability and peace that could be attained if class were put aside (or at least temporized).The well-off Schlegel sisters, who love each other as only sisters can, have a temporary parting of the ways when Helen, the more liberal of the two, gets involved with a couple, the Basts, who are poverty stricken and "lower class" while Margaret becomes friends with the Wilcox family who have money and status. What happens over the next three years is heartbreaking and some of the events are unexpected and may take the reader by surprise. But in the end the spirit and magic of Howard's End prevails, bringing peace and understanding.This is a classic work, written poetically, and full of emotion without being overwrought. Recommended highly.
