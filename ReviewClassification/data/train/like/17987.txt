4.5 "Fuentes Brothers" Stars!What's it about?A teenage guy comes to stay with a college professor and his family, trying to start a new life, away from drugs and crime. Falling in love with his daughter was NOT part of the plan.The best bits:I absolutely LOVED that the scene shown on the cover ACTUALLY HAPPENS IN THE STORY. Not only is it fantastic that the cover actually matches a pivotal scene... but I'm a sucker for kissing in the rain, so I was totally in swoon heaven.The worst bits:I thought the female character, Kiara, was so interesting... and so under-developed. Unfortunately, she was almost completely useless for most of the story. I liked her a lot, but she was no more developed than the supporting characters of the book. It was really the smart-talking Carlos who carried the book from start to finish (but Kiara's cookies were a good sign that she could hold her own as a main character, if she'd been given half a chance).Recommended for:Fans of the series; fans if opposites-attracting in YA romance. I can't wait to read the third book in this series!
