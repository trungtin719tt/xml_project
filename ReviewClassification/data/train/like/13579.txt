This was really good and I wanted to give it 5 stars but I did find the ending to be abrupt and a bit unsatisfying so I'm knocking it down to 4 but overall this was a fantastic audio. I didn't really know what to expect and I am a bit embarrassed to admit that I always thought that the 20,000 leagues in the title referred to depth. Turns out it's distance. Oops I feel a little stupid for that. This is a really enjoyable sea adventure that holds up well. I recommend the audio narrated by Andrew Wincott.
