5 stars toDaphne du Maurier'sRebecca. I loved it and probably consider it 4 1/2 stars just because of a few small items (but I can't not give it 5 here!).StoryThe second wife of a wealthy widower (you'll never know her name) tries to figure out how to fit into her new family when it seems there's now way how. With many twists and turns, both suspense and a bit of romance, this story captures your attention immediately and takes you on a path of great intrigue. Just when you think you've figured it out, du Maurier confounds and surprises you -- in a good way. I would love to be a fly on the wall in Manderley (name of the estate where the book takes place) to catch all the hidden expressions and conversations.Strengths1. Mystery and Intrigue2. Character DevelopmentWeaknesses1. Some unanswered questions (small ones).2. I want more.Final ThoughtsRead it. Experience it. Don't just watch the movie adaption. You want to make up your own mind about what everyone looks like and acts like.There was almost a Broadway show made based on this book; I was super-excited, but funding failed.
