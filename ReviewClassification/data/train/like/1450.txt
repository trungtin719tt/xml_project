Review to come when I can recover. I hope that my fellow Frodo, Sam and Aragorn will continue onto Two Towers with me!It's re-read and buddy read as of 1 July with the lovely:Fuzaila/FrodoBhavik/SamFares/MerryRusty Grey/Aragorn/Bill the PonyAnd me, Pippin. Because I'm a ditz. Don't worry Fuzaila, book Frodo is awesome :)I've decided we're all Hobbits since there are four of us.I love the diversity of our read - two African and three Indian readers :DObviously. The best book in the universe deserves as much.
