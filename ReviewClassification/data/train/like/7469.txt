Holy beeswax. I've never come across a writer who can change her or his entire style and do it with such panache. This is one creepy book and it's so tricky. You go in feeling sane and come out not so sure what sanity really means anymore. This is the story of what one of the book's real-life characters calls "an ordinary person forced into an extraordinary situation." I was already a fan of Longfellow's. Can I be a devotee?
