Mood, atmosphere, character. Encapsulation of the zeitgeist, social commentary; "The Remains of the Day" delves into the dark side of humanity. So much is held within the pages of this marvelous book, the account of one of the last butlers to work at a large manor in England. What is Dignity? seems to be the major thread that unites all of his different experiences of becoming a largely marginalized person, of becoming someone with a worth different from others. The love story is heart wrenching; the level of repression is palpable.I do love "Never Let Me Go", &amp; this one seems more in tune with that one than, say, the marvelous "A Pale View of Hills", or the sick/sad/strange "When We Were Orphans." "Never Let Me Go" is about the wastes of youth, while "Remains" is about a life lived fully in a restricted state that's perpetual. They are both equally sad and amazing, definitely not lite reading; serious &amp; grave in tone and subject matter. Kazuo Ishiguro is a literary man's Man.
