I loved listening to this because Lin-Manuel Miranda narrated it and, subsequently, I was attuned to every word. But although I loved listening to this, both because of Lin's voice and the content, I would love to revisit this in a few years and actually read it to see what else I can pull from it. It's very different than anything I would typically read, and it delves so far into backstories and family lineage that I would love to try flying through it in order to pick up more connections.This was just a really brilliant story told through an interesting narrator, equal parts educational and tragic.
