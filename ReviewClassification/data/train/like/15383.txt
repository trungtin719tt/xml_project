2nd read:I'm a dumbass. I fully admit to being a dumbass.I don't know what the hell I was doing the first time I read this book..because I gave it 3.5 stars. After reading so many shitty books this year I know now what a great book this really is.This time it gets it's full five stars. Five frigging, huge, screaming stars. Stars for SeVRo, Pax, Mustang and the rest of these characters.1st read: When I was a dumbass.Unpopular opinion time. I'm sorry fangirls. I just didn't love this book.I did enjoy parts of it. Then there were times when my eyes just glazed over. Dang it. I had such high hopes for it too.I probably will check out the sequels to see how it goes before final decision is made.
