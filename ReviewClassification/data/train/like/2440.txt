I enjoy reading but McMurtry asks way too much. This epic tale spans thousands of miles from the Old West (TX) to the as-of-yet-up-for-grabs land of Montana. The characters are endearing; these are the premiere &amp; authentic cowboys. The best stuff here is the campfire philosophy of Gus, and his incredible relationship with the solemn Woodrow Call is the stuff that legend is made of. The book refuses to end though, and despite the authenticity of this far away world (it is the Lord of the Rings of Western classics), I could not help but feel that the different story lines, of the outlaws, whores and fellow pioneers went nowhere. (A life lesson in everything?) Would the plot have suffered if more chapters had been edited out? (Perhaps the bigness is part of the whole Lonesome Dove Experience.)Nevertheless the book was incredibly tight, the characters brilliant in their thoughts &amp;, even better, their actions. But sometimes I did want it to end... I'll admit the cowboys sometimes more than overstayed their welcome.
