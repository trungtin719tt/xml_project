It's an important historical novel that, within a fictionalized approach, offers excellent insight into the formation of the Jewish state and nation of Israel in the late 1940s. In fact, EXODUS opens in 1947 as underground Jewish groups attempt to thwart the British attempts to keep Palestine-bound Jewry sealed up in virtual concentration camps in other areas like Cyrpus, in the obvious hope they will give up any attempt to find their homeland and return to war-torn Europe. The hypocritical and occasionally cruel actions by the British stand in clear contrast to their Balfour Declaration made during the first World War, which acknowledged in principle the right of self-determination of the Jewish people to found a homeland in what was then called the Palestinian Mandate.Overall, EXODUS is a very powerful book, but the writing style is a little awkward. Sometimes the main characters are a little too good for their own good -- Paul Newman's role as Ari Ben Canaan in the movie was no exaggeration, his character really was portrayed that way in this book.
