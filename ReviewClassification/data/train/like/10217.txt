The Little House on the Prairie books bring back so many good memories. I have been looking for my box of old books for awhile now but still haven't found it. I'm really hoping it didn't get lost when I moved last year. There are so many books that I would love to re-read.I'm not sure why I didn't read these to my daughter. I think she had so many books that we just never got around to it.Little House in the Big Woods is the first book of the series and will always be my favorite, but I did enjoy all of the books in the collection. I tried to find the edition on here that looked most like what I remember, and I think this is the same cover that was on my book.I can clearly my mom reading it to me before I could read myself. Sitting on my bed next to her watching as she read. Once I was able to read it myself I picked it up again to read to her, watching as her fingers slid underneath the words and helping me with the hard ones. She mentioned the other day that it's one of her favorite memories too.I loved all of the characters. Laura, Ma, Pa, Carrie and Mary as well as many others. I dreamt of living in that little cabin in the woods and desperately wanted Laura Ingalls as a best friend. The fun and adventures these children had along with their dog, Jack was entertaining every time it was read to me or by me.When it was turned into a TV show, I was escastic! I remember it was on every Sunday at 6pm on Channel 2. I was allowed to watch it while sitting in my dads lazy-boy recliner and nothing could tear me away.If I can't find my old books I will definitley buy another collection as I would love to re-read them at some point.Even writing this review has brought back great memories of these wonderful stories &lt;3
