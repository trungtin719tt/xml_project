Hand me my damn smelling salts. . .please.I feel like I'm recovering from the flu, finishing this read.It's been a disorienting time. . . just like a nasty run-in with influenza: headaches, sleeplessness, fever, delusions. . . no cure for you until it's over.Wow.I talked to this book (always the scariest and most sincere sign of my personal devotion).I apologized to Shirley Jackson (aloud, in my room, alone).I asked her to forgive me for not reading this before. This ridiculously short, little bullet of a brilliant novel that came out in 1959.I mean. . . could it be more current?More essential for all writers?More intriguing for anyone. . .anyonewho loves to get lost in a story?Could it be more. . . wait for it. . .labyrinthine? (Never used that bad boy before, so, jazz hands).And Eleanor. . .Oh, Eleanor!!I belonged to Eleanor, and she to me, by page 3:Eleanor Vance was thirty-two years old when she came to Hill House. The only person in the world she genuinely hated, now that her mother was dead, was her sister. . . She could not remember ever being truly happy in her adult life; her years with her mother had been built up devotedly around small guilts and small reproaches, constant weariness, and unending despair.Sob and cringe, and who can't relate on some level to an adult who feels completely alone in this world?By the time Eleanor admits her truth to the small crowd at Hill House, she had my affection so completely, I had to put down the book, I was so moved by her honesty:I haven't any apartment. . . I made it up. I sleep on a cot at my sister's, in the baby's room. I haven't any home, no place at all. . . No home. Everything in all the world that belongs to me is in a carton in the back of my car. That's all I have, some books and things I had when I was a little girl, and a watch my mother gave me. So you see there's no place you can send me.The 1950s was a cruel time for a single female, and, frankly, it's not that much better now. A woman who can fit all of her possessions in one car and declares that a haunted house is the only place she belongs. . .Well, I cried right on the damn book.Oh, and in case you're wondering. . . yes, the story is scary as hell.
