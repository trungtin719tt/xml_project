If I had to describe what I felt reading this book in one word it would becharmed. This is such a heartwarming and original story concept and I'm not sure I've ever read something so objectively sweet.This is the story of Enzo, a philosopher dog with an obsession with opposable thumbs, racing, his family and his belief that when he dies he will be reincarnated as a man. The story is told solely from Enzo's perspective and I found it funny and imaginative. I couldn't help but near constantly read excerpts to my husband because Enzo has an incredibly endearing and amusing view on life. Stein's image of how a dog would view the world I found both unique and inventive while maintaining as much realism as one could expect when reading a dogs perspective.My only issue with the story is a few of Stein's language / descriptor choices. Personally, I think you can discuss a woman breastfeeding without describing her nipple and you can also describe female dogs without calling them "a bitch of a dog". It's not that it came off as necessarily offensive or overly sexualized it just feltwhollyUNnecessaryto the story and it conflicted a bit with how I felt Enzo was as a character.Overall, if you love dogs or not I think anyone would enjoy this story. It's original, entertaining and a loving story about familial bonds. I don't know what humans did to deserve them but they are the most pure and perfect things we have. Now I've got to adopt another dog and name him Enzo because his voice and his character was absolutely unforgettable.
