It took me longer than usual to get into this King book, which was largely down to the writing style. I felt it was different than his usual style (which is the one I adore so much). I had the same problem when readingThe Shining. It was just lacking this "special something", and thus, I felt disconnected from the characters until about a halfway through.However, all the stuff that was happening up until this point still had an effect on me and absolutely terrified me. And then came the big shift and I got really into it. As soon as I got to know the two main characters better, I got so excited and couldn't stop reading! It all got so interesting after a certain revelation and I was so relieved, because up until then, I had the feeling that I was missing out on whatever makes other people love this book so much.After reaching the halfway point, the genre "Psychological Horror" was truly embodied. There is just something about Annie Wilkes that is constantly frightening, no matter what this woman does. After reading that King wrote her as the personification of cocaine, I totally understand why she is so terrifying, even in the (rare) moments when she is acting nice. I wish I had the right qualifications to analyze this book and its characters on a psychological level, because I bet it would incredibly interesting.So even though it took me a while to be enthralled by the book, it is stilldefinitelyworth a read!I'd also like to mention how much I appreciated the little snippets of the actual "Misery"-novels that were included in the story. It added a lot more depth and realism.
