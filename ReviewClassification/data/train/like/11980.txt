I had put off reading this story for a variety of reasons, main among them that I knew what I would be facing, and was eager to find an excuse not to. After having been to the Dachau Concentration Camp in Germany, the images of the now-dead ovens still linger somewhere in the recesses of my mind, and to back to it, to read from someone who went through it, was not something I readily wanted to do. But I did; I gathered myself up and read through in a couple of days, the end of the book taking me by surprise, so engrossed I was. I was stoic as I read; no emotion showed on my face, and most of the time I read while alone. Inside, however, it was very different.The world that Wiesel conjures is not a make-believe land, but an echo of the world he lived in, the world he saw destroyed. The experiences he writes about come not from research in books, but from scars in his skin and soul. At times all I wanted to do was to put the book down and never go back, but that would be a gross disservice to all those who went through the fires of Hell and never came back, perhaps even more so to those who did and still bear the scars and carry the torch, crying to the world to Never Forget. At the core, Night is an intensely personal story, one you do not have to be Jewish to understand. Being Jewish helps, though, and makes the story incredibly relevant and compelling. Because as you read all the horrors undergone, you always remember that you are Jewish, that you are one of those they targeted, one of those put into the camps, one of those whom, when the next Hitler comes, will be at risk.I can understand why Wiesel says that, after all the books he has written, Night still holds a special place in his heart and soul; it is probably the same place in which he carved a niche for the story in the heart of every reader.
