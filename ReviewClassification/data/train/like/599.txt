I read this book back in High School. I hated it. I thought it was boring and stupid and all I wanted to do was spread the word that this book was terrible and no one should read it. I had it marked one star on Goodreads and it had a home on my least favorite shelf.Well, I have been waiting years to find the perfect place to use this gif:I reread in late August, early September 2017. I have to say that I should probably reread everything I read bank in High School to get a better perspective.I enjoyed the book quite a bit this time. The story in intricate and dark. Jane Eyre is a tragic hero who does her best through the whole book but keeps encountering unfortunate situation after unfortunate situation. The story held my interest a lot more than some other classic novels I have read.My only complaint was a few times certain plot points were belabored. I found myself saying, "Okay, I get it, let's move on."So, everyone, if you remember a book from your youth with less than enthusiastic fondness, it might be worth giving it another shot. You never know what you might find!
