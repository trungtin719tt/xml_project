This book is one of those books that you either love it or hate it. I loved it. In fact its one of my favorite books of all time. Its dark and deep but beautiful. The book is actually based in the town I grew up in so it was interesting to read about the town I grew up in only during the setting of the book. It was wonderful to read about the church I grew up in, my grandmothers church and later, the church I married my husband in. The book being set in Cape Breton was what grabbed my attention but the story dragged me in and kept a death grip on me til I finished it. The first time I read it, I actually stayed up all night to finish it.This book is not for the light at heart. If you don't take any enjoyment from stories that talk about incest or other related but depressing topics, then this book is not for you. If you are looking for a happily ever after, go find something else. This isn't a fluffy and happy novel.This is a book that I will always turn to when I want to reread a favorite.
