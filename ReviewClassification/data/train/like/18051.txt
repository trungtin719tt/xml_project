during the expidition of the subjugating war in ireland, one soldier of cromwell got possessed by demon. the chaplain had no other choice(actually, he was good for nothing) and threw him into a pond(used to be a method of exorcism), the soldier sank without a single note of sound...moments after, the demon went up to the surface and said to the priest:"you just killed that poor man, you scam artist."the pastor replied:"no, i did not. i saved him, he's with god now"then the demon roared in rage:"saved? you should get into the water then see whether he was saved!"the chaplain just turned and walked away, said:"i can't swim", indifferentlyi think it was a curse for oskar the drum boyyears come and goi read it many years before when there was no abdominal fat and no specs as thick as the butt of a beer bottle for mebut why do i always associate this book of story with the hills have eyes??am i a nutty fuckwad??in other words, i'd like to combine these two themes and the protagonist to be a nam veteran who'd live in a remote desert ranch or a lorn mountain village, then there we'll have a really weird and grotesque piece of freak
