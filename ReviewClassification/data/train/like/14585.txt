Pre read review:Oh lord. Why do I have to wait so long? *whines*Alex. Alex. Answer me: are you alive? Please tell me you're alive. *cries* Don't die, please don't die.REVIEWOh my goshhh.Okay.Guys.I have a confession.I am a huge sucker for terrible romance and love triangles. I know,I know.I kind of saw the ending coming(view spoiler)[even though I didn't want to admit it. And then I flipped to the last page; last word: ALEX.I died inside. Honestly.Lauren Oliver, are you serious?But then when I read the last few paragraphs, I died some more. My Alex. My sweet Alex. Oh lordy.(hide spoiler)]I liked the action. It was well paced, although the usage of colons annoyed me. Now, don't get me wrong; I actually use colons a lot. But it was in every other sentence sometimes, and I was like NO YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO SPACE COLONS OUT. DON'T ABUSE THEM.Anyways, I need to read Requiem. Now. Hurryhurryhurry Lauren Oliver.I love the titles of these books more than anything.Delirium, Pandemonium, Requiem.How much more perfect can you get?
