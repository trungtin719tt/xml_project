City of Bones: Read 3 timesGood beginning to the seiries if not a little boring. If it wasnt for Jace's character this series would fail and not be on the New York best selling list.City of Ashes:Was a good enough book but it you can tell it was leading up to the next book, I like Cassandra Claire because she makes every character she has like they are real. I cant wait to see this movie I think because it has more of an edge to it, it will be more entertaining! Also she couldn't have done too much with City of Bones because it was only the first book, this book has more layers. My favorite part is the forbidden love, and how they cant be together but they really want to, it was compelling the first time I read it. Everyone really wants to know what happens with Jace and ClaryCity of Glass:Oh my gosh she soo could have finished the series with this book, but it is one of those decisions that I am not completely against because I do love the series. I wish she could continue on with Clockwork Princess she could write about Will and Tessa's marriage. Any way back to this book. My favorite part is hard to pick, I like when Clary and Jace are at the manor house, Cassandra defiantly knows how to write steamy scenes. This whole book is just really exciting and when Sebastian and Jace fight your on the edge of your seat the whole time! Oh its just a great ending. It was shock and excitement that came over me when I heard there was going to be a few more books! :) I love this series.
