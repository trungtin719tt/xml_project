The most beautiful fun you can have is when you know more about a once loved book that you couldn't departure easily.Unlike many authors, JKR knew better than to abandon her hard work of creating such world, so she spoils her readers with more every chance she gets and as a reader and basically a girl who grew up with Harry Potter books as her only friends, I am grateful for what she presents.One of my favourite tales is of course The Tale of the Three Brothers as I always hear Hermione's voice while reading it, but being introduced to the rest of the tales was fantastic. I lovedThe Fountain of Fair FortuneandThe Wizard and the Hopping Pot, the concept and the meaning behind these two were so beautiful.The highlight of this short book was Dumbeldore's notes, they left me in awe and laughing.
