Witches are out there. You're lucky you're reading this now. It means that a witch never got you as a child or you escaped from their clutches.Witches are demons and have the following features: they wear wigs, they have squared-off feet with no toes and they smell faintly like old urinal. They have an insatiable need to kill, maim and turn children into animals. They can't stand children because to them they smell like dog poo.And they love meetings. And they love forming a club.I swear I have worked with one or two witches in the past.Everyone knows this story, especially since the movies came out in the 90s. The movie came out just that bit late for me, however I did watch it later and I feel that it clouds my enjoyment of the story. With 'The Witches' I'm a text purist. It's the same with 'Matilda', the movie was too late and nowhere as good as the text.So, the story is that the main character's parents are killed in a crash and he goes to live with his grandmother who is Norwegian and knows a bit about witches. They go on a holiday and they meet up with the annual english meeting of witches.ORAn old woman who is hell bent on revenge from childhood trauma baits a group of witches with her grandson so she can kill them all!! Yippee Kay Yay Mother Witches.You be the judge.P.S. That story about the girl in the painting isstillone of the most haunting stories I have ever read.
