When I was in college, a little film calledThe Hauntingwas released. Starring Lily Taylor, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Owen Wilson, this supernatural horror flick was essentially a modern re-imagining of Shirley Jackson's,The Haunting of Hill House.My Mom and I went to the theater to see it when it released that summer and I promptly fell in love. Soon after, I was able to buy it on VHS ((I know, right!?!) and commenced watching it 2,638,400 times. I wish this was an exaggeration but sadly, it's not.At this point, I had never read the original source material. As a matter of fact, this is the first time that I have read this 1959 classic. I finally decided to pick it up spurred on by the celebration of 'Women in Horror Fiction' month.I listened to this on audiobook and was able to get through it very quickly. It is a short book, at just under 200-pages, and the narrator was absolutely fabulous. I was so invested in this story, her voice was mesmerizing and seemed to transport me into that damn house!I think my early love of the film version,The Hauntingreally helped me to imagine the whole narrative. They did a great job in casting that film. Seriously. Lily Taylor WAS Nell. I loved Jackson's creation of her character. The mousy, sheltered girl who finally gains her freedom after what had to be a traumatic experience of years caring for her ailing mother.I know, I know.Meg, this is supposed to be a book review, but I couldn't write this review without mentioning that movie, as I know it has impacted my reading experience.I truly enjoyed this book. The build-up, the atmosphere, the suspense. I thought the supernatural, or alleged supernatural elements, were so well done. I had many spine-chilling, look over your shoulder moments with this and it was great.The characters interactions with one another were also well fleshed out. I believed their relationships and their connections to one another. Each feeling compelled to participate for their own, very different, reasons. I especially enjoyed the complex relationship between Nell and Theo.Then we get to the ending.Things were rolling along, great guns, and then, POOF, we are finished.A friend of mine explained it as such, it's like she as writing this great book and then she just got tired of writing it. I agree with that.Done with this project, drops mic, exits.Even with this in mind though, I did really enjoy my time with this story. I may even revisit it again someday. This should be appreciated for the great piece of classic horror fiction that it is. It has influenced so many other stories and for that, I doff my cap to Shirley Jackson. A true pioneer in the genre.
