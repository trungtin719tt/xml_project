My friend Amelie and I used this book as half of our corpus when we wrote our 1990 paper,An Implementable Semantics for Comparative Constructions. We spent several days combing through the text, extracting and categorizing every single occurrence of a comparative construction. So you'll appreciate that I know what I'm talking about when I say it's better than most murder mysteries.
