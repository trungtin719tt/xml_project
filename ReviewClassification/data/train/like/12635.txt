A serious favourite from my formative youth, strange and harsh and nearly illicitly romantic so that I reread it, no matter how much Kit's predicament upset and scared me (mobs and trials and institutions are some of my worst fears).Reading it quickly now - for the first time in English - many decades after first finding it in the small town library, I'm struck by how good a book it is. Many, amongst them the woman who "raised/formed" me as well as Narnia, crumble in retrospect, but there was a reason I'd remembered the title and found this book and even wrote a report on it at my brief stint working in a bookshop, a report also decades after having read it.Due to circumstances I'd like to explain elsewhere, I've been searching romance novels again, tempted by what I know are false reviews and would lead only to more bad, boring and soul-sapping money-wasters. This children's book has more romance than ANY of the official adult romances, even should those have explicit sex scenes. Nat's wiry figure, his hard tanned wrists in the stocks, how Kit sees those glimpses is so much more effective and still to my taste after all those years.The terror of the mob is lessened, and I took in more of the political situation (Royalists and American rebels), but I'm still surprised that Speare wrote such a liberal book 50 years ago. Of course Puritans today are also positive like Gale portrayed them in "Notes", but to realise it was just Quakers they branded and killed and to see tiny inserts about how the baby son died because he had to be christened in the freezing cold is unusual.There is a great economy of writing, nothing superfluous, another mark of all the books I wanted to keep and not return to the library, back when I read a lot without it all getting mixed up or being washed out, when I reread; all those books seem so much shorter now, but it's THERE, just as in old movies - more content in less space.Speare also shows great fairness, shows how the gruff and initially "hateful" uncle is a good man, having fought hard, his grief and load shown in a single simple powerful image, his politics and those of other men balanced to cross over, checkboard, religion and politics and ethics not all given to the "good" or "bad" side.I had forgotten that the old "witch" was saved, and even the cat, and was glad. I had not forgotten that the beautiful young priest came back and fell into the lap of the crippled girl, or how Kit met Nate again in the bright sunny wheat field, and the pleasant surprise of that at my first read.It should be public knowledge by now that it's not easier to write for children than for adults. I hope as much care is still paid to YA Lit., because it's missing in romance and fantasy novels, the genres we progress to as "adults". I wish there were adult books like this.ETA: since the Swedish series Gulla was another formative book before I went into romantic thriller land, I guess there is Puritan in me or my upbringing.
