During the Stalin regime, people were sentenced to hard labor for the flimsiest reasons. I wondered why the author focused on just one single day in a grim labor camp since the prisoners usually had long imprisonments of eight to twenty years. Ivan Denisovich Shukhov is in his eighth year of a ten year sentence. Conditions are horrible with inadequate food, warm clothes, and heat in frigid conditions. But he cannot think of the future because his prison term could be extended if the authorities brought him up on another charge. Shukhov can only think about the present--how can he survive for one more day?Shukhov is a hard-working mason and carpenter who sometimes gets an extra bread ration for his good work. He tries to savor every bite of bread and spoonful of soup since there are no other pleasures in life. To keep his feet warm he pads his boots with rags. He knows how to work the system, taking on extra little jobs, like mending clothes or holding someone's place in line, in exchange for a cigarette or a few bites of bread. With the guards, it's important to fly under the radar because an argument might land him in a freezing cell--and almost certain death from hypothermia, pneumonia, or tuberculosis. So Shukhov lives in the present."There were three thousand six hundred and fifty-three days like that in his stretch. From the first clang of the rail to the last clang of the rail....Three thousand six hundred and fifty-three days....The three extra days were for leap years."The author had been imprisoned from 1945 to 1953 for criticizing Joseph Stalin in letters to friends. Solzhenitsyn based this book on his experiences at a labor camp in Karaganda in northern Kazakhstan. Premier Khrushchev, who denounced the excesses and abuses of Stalin, allowed the publication of the book in 1962.
