No point in detailing the plot. Every point in speaking of the effect this book had on me. Things that confused me, seem cleared up. The path I've been seeking seems straight before me. And a bonus, this book is beautifully written, amazingly imagined, and speaks from a mystics understand. I was, and am, in love with it. More, please more, from this author
