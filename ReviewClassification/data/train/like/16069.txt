Kyle Kingsbury is rich, tall, blond, perfect.... and aspoiledteenager that take pleasure breaking young girls hearts. Really a awful person that deserve a witch lesson about inside beauty.Well... books exist to this motive...take us to charming and delight worlds helping us to forget the real world we live... place that acclaim anorexic models (that look like dead womans walking) as feminine beauty to follow.No place to moral lesson, so going on with my review, I may say that this book (as you notice reading the title) is a fairy tale on ours moderns days.You should read it?-YESif you are a romantic person interesting in find a well written story that will make you cry (a little tear go down my face reading his despair at the final subway scene)-NOif you don't believe in rewrite classics.I was the second kind of person, but Alex Flinn surprised me. After this book if I find another classic fairy tale take to ours days I'll give a try. Maybe I'll have a great time and fun like I just had reading Beastly.5 stars
