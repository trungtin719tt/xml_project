I learned a lot reading this book! It is a work of historical fiction set in the Gilded Age. The main character, Penelope, has been raised as a socialite in a well to do family. During the Gilded Age, many families suffered due to an economic depression. Penelope's family lost a great deal of money during this time. Realizing that her prospects were limited due to financial loss, an unscrupulous wealthy married man makes advances toward Penelope. She has to weigh the help he can offer her vs. her conscience. Penelope also begins to get involved with the Suffrage Movement. I found the discussion regarding the suffrage movement very interesting - I learned a lot. I was not aware how cumbersome and restricting the dresses and corsets were that women wore. A big part of the Suffrage Movement was encouraging women to move away from "irrational dress".Diana Forbes crafts an interesting fast moving story. Her characters are well developed.It was a pleasure to have the author, Diana Forbes, come in person to our book club. She is an interesting and dynamic individual. She told us about all the research she did in writing her book. It was a long process (8 years) from her first idea of a plot... until years later when the book was published. She is in the process of writing a sequel. I look forward to reading it!
