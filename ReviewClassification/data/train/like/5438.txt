2019 re-read.One of my favorites from HS (more than 30 years ago) this did not time travel as well as I remembered but still a good read and to consider his vision when writing (first published in 1895) this was steampunk before there was steampunk.The dodgy old guys huddled up listening to the dusty time traveler relate his story was a popular vehicle back then (see Joseph Conrad) but still works well, even if the language is stilted and overly formal.What I recall best and what still thrills are the Morlocks and of course my perception is skewed by the 2002 Simon Wells film starring Jeremy Irons as the Uber-Morlock. While the film divulged from HG Wells vision as far as the Morlocks are concerned, the idea that humanity splits after 800,000 years into the peaceful but dimwitted Eloi and the bestial and carnivorous under dwellers makes this far more entertaining than it would be otherwise.Out of date and somewhat out of touch, this is still foundational SF and a must read for fans of the genre.
