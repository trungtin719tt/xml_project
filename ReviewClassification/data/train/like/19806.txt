You forgot some books, you hardly remember other, but some stay with you throughout your life! This is such a book for me. I raced all bookshops in order to find a hardcover and it was not so easy in my country but I managed it and now it's one of my most precious things.Quite a good book with a catchy plot and mind blowing action.I read it like ages ago and re-read several times, why haven't I rated it earlier? I wish I knew) lol
