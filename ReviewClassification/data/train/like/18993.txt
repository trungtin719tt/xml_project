I. CANNOT. DEAL.This book was incredible and this series may topple TID as my favorite in the Shadowhunter world if it continues this way. Definitely the strongest first book in any of the series for sure.There were so many things that were RIGHT about this book, but especially the characters. They were fantastic and wonderful and their journey was HEARTBREAKING but still amazing and I just can't deal guys I can't.This book broke me into a million pieces so I honesty don't know how I'm going to survive the rest of the books.I may reread this immediately because I do want to video review it but also I just need it in my life again..REREAD BEFORE LOS ALSO HOPEFULLY TO DO A VIDEO REVIEW.So many things. My heart.REREAD TO READ QOAADspoiler alert i still love this book and i still love julian and emma that's it.
