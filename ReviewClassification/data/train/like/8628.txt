I'M ABSOLUTELY SPEECHLESS!!!!!!!!! I don't even know where to begin with my review. I suppose I'll have to think on it a bit... JUST KNOW... there are not enough stars in the sky.As I work my way through this series.... I am just dumbfounded at the awesomeness before me. And this book, by far my favorite so far in the series...words cannot express my love for these characters, and this story.But again, it's one of those stories that enraptures those ONLY that it's meant to. AndIam definitely on that list!!!!!![image error]
