I read this quite awhile ago and then I gave someone my copy. I've always wished I hadn't because I couldn't find it again. This is reissue, much more beautiful to look at than the originals.It's a story of a woman in 1920s San Francisco who is very much like Jane Austen'sEmma. She's spoiled and selfish, rich and bored. Out of her own selfish interests she destroys all she loves. But she finds her own heart. It's a hard lesson and sad to watch, but so interesting and entertaining, you can't take your eyes away.
