I read this book for my hometown book club. This book is an easy, smooth read. I've been wanting to read a book by Jhumpa Lahiri for a long time and I'm glad the opportunity finally arised. I now have put all the other books that my library has by her on hold.I think part of the reason I connected so much with this book is because my best friend from college was an immigrant at age 6 from India. Her parents are traditional in a country that is completely different than theirs. They would like their daughters to end up with a man from India. However, they live in a city with only 80 Indian people total. When you takeaway all the children, parents and non-single men that doesn't leave much choice. While reading this book I kept thinking of her.The book starts off with the Ganguli parents living their traditional life in Calcutta and then their large move to become Americans. Right after their arranged wedding, Ashoke and Ashima Ganguli settle together in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Ashoke is an engineer and adapts into the American culture much easier than his wife, who resists all things American. When their son is born, the task of naming him becomes great in this new world. Since the baby can't leave the hospital without a name they decide it to be Gogol. The name of a Russian writer that his father loved.The book then starts following Gogol as he stumbles along the first-generation path. He has a strewn conflict with loyalties, crazy love affairs with Indian and non-Indian women and so much more.The author really shows what troubles face first-generation children.I loved this book and was so taken by the main character. I really hope the author will someday write a second book!
