UpdateSilent censorship by Goodreads. At the bottom. It wouldn't be relevant here.I read this years ago and reviewed it, but it seems to have disappeared from my booklist. Did I blot my copybook by slagging off the author's major drug and alcohol habits and thereby get it deleted or what? It's not like the author could object as a) he's dead and b) he was proud of his prodigious consumption of substances that got him off his head.Or was it just the GR monster, munching away, like a moth, holes here, holes there and you don't find them until you actually go looking?Whichever. Bastards.When I was very fired up about the censorships and deletions I wrote a 'reviewand I'm wondering if I was more prescient than I realised?25 Dec 2018. This 'review' about Goodreads censorship hasalsobeen deleted (silently, I just found out, I was never told). Well, well, well... This silent censorship, just delete everything they don't approve of and don't let the reviewer know.... that's really not in keeping with the Goodreads Otis set up. Is this Amazon? What does that say for the future of books you only rent on your Kindle?
