I've said it before, and I'll say it again, James Dashner is my freaken Hero!!!!WOW you guys! Just O M G, WoW!If y'all liked The Maze Runner, you'll LovEThe Scorch Trials! It's unbelievable!James Dashner as once again created a none stop, action packed adventure that will blow your ever loving Shuck-Sticks-Cranked mind.With new characters and all your favorite crazed-lingo-Gladers, comes a story of constant struggle to survive, a once again, Trial that are even more terrifying, dangerous and insane as The Maze.The Scorch is a hot mess of deadly obstacles that are created by the (seemingly good) WICKED (World In Catastrophe Killzone Experiment Department) and set up to test the survived Gladers. Test what, you might ask? Can't tell ya, since even thesmallestdetail will give away the entire reasoning behind this mind boggling book. There issomuch that happens and there is so much I wish I could say, but I will say that all your questions will be answered from the first one, but be warned, by the time you reach the last page, your mind will be spinning all over again.JAMES! Your.Killing.Me!Even though I loved this book to pieces, I still loved the first one more, but I think it was because it was so new and brilliant that I was completely blown way. The story is chalked filled with suspense and wonder. I was completely baffled the entire time I was reading this. No skimming-room for this one guys, your going to want to hang on every word. I never knew who to trust, who was good, who was bad, I thought I figured out something only for that idea to be shoot down the next chapter after. The illusion of safety is repeatedly yanked and I found myself frustrated in the best way possible. I can't count how many time I hated this one character and then wanted to believe in-said character in the same breath.It's complex and maddening, and amazing and I just want to crawl in James mind and go exploring for a few hours, or weeks.I can go on forever bouncing about this book, but if I don't stop now I'll just end up spoiling something and then I'll get things thrown at me and I have a standard no-throwing-policy, so I'll just quit while I'm a head.This book was awesome and I'm once again floored by the concept, these characters and the mastermind who pulled it all together.Loved it! Can't get enough! I want more and I can't freaken believe we have to wait a YEAR to find out what the hell is gonna happen nextKilling me James, Killing me!Just Shuck it and read this now!!
