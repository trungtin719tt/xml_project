Let me preface by saying I do not follow any one religious path. I'm a searcher, and I'm not sure if I'll ever settle on one faith. That said, The Screwtape Letters, an intense rumination on good and evil, as told through the letters of one demon to another, is a work I feel everyone should read, if to do nothing but understand the true nature of evil. I'll admit, I picked up the book because I thought a tale told by a demon would be kind of cool... sexy in a dark fun kind of way. The experience of reading it was anything but that. It was fully engrossing -- far better than mere fun. It did what the best books always do; it expanded my understanding of the world around me. It gave me something I've kept with me since. A valued, and somewhat terrible knowledge. My copy included a forward that explained that C.S. Lewis had to recover from writing it. After reading and processing his work, I know why.
