This book completely ravaged me. I didn't expect to fall in love with Gus, but dammit if I did anyway. McMurtry dragged me through every mud hole, snake pit, camp fire and stampede his characters endured. I felt every cactus prickle and tasted the beans and bad coffee. Who knew I could love the West so damn much?Next to The Three Musketeers, this is the best man-love story around. Gus and Call are totally OTP 4evah.I won't spoiler the story for anyone here... but there's a place in the book where I got so upset that I literally threw the book across the room I was so upset. I simply refused to read any further. I hate Larry McMurtry for that. But dammit if it wasn't some of the best writing of all time to make me feel that way.This novel goes down as one of the finest examples of Western literature of all time as far as I'm concerned. Wallace Stegner ain't got nothin on the McLarryMan.
