Cooper was a prolific writer with something like 40 novels to his credit, most written in the early 19th century. The Last of the Mohicans is his best known work and was popular in America as well as Europe. It's a frontier adventure story with a hint of romance to it, but Cooper's portrayal of Indians and women in the novel, considered shallow and inaccurate by todays readers, detract from it's image. My interest in the novel was from an historical viewpoint. It is based loosely on events that occurred during the French and Indian War, and provides an insight into the influence of the British and French occupation prior to the Revolutionary War. Cooper's writing style is somewhat laborious which has kept me from reading any of his other novels. I gave it 4 stars because of it's significance and position in the history of American Literature.
