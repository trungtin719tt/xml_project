I have to say this book is much more than a step up from the first book. I thought the first book was ok at best but this book it better on an epic scale. If you are reading this I am assuming you have read the first book.Katniss &amp; Peeta Controversially win the 74th Hunger games. Controversially because there is only supposed to be one winner of the games, but these two choose to kill themselves rather than kill each other. This act of defiance is the spark for a revolution. The evil President Snow (Leader of the Capital), tells Katness to either smother out this spark before it ignites, or people close to her will be killed.The revolution starts small and cases small disruptions in the capital, and ends up with the "Peacekeepers" (Capital police force), becoming more brutal in all districts (including District 12). This time the Hunger Games is the Quarter Quell (celebrating 25 years of the game), which allow special stipulations in the games. Can Katness defy the Capital again?This book is less action packed then the first but a lot more emotional. Katniss is more herself in this book rather surly, bad tempered, emotional. Peeta is her polar opposite likable by everyone, managing to rally everyone with his words; I think Katniss even admits he would be a better revolution leader then she ever wood so she is determined to martyr herself so he can live.
