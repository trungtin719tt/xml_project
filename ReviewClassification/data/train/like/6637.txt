I've been avoiding this book since I was a teenager. I did so because this is a trigger for me and I knew I couldn't handle it. But...I figured that it's been two years since I cut my mother out of my life and that I finally feel free. And strong... well, at least strong enough to face each day. That's got to be better than nothing.Anyway, this isn't about me so instead I'll say that no matter what, I'm glad I read it. I feel I have a duty to face other true stories of horrific child abuse, if only to put on the armor of bravery and show children that they don't need to run from the horror of their abuser's glee; that life can be good and it can feel somewhat safe.That they can save themselves like I did and that all the pain, isolation and fear that consumes and suffocates them can break the barrier down and leave them with a profound sense of compassion, forgiveness and love for the very monsters who made/make us feel like they are powerful enough to stop the universe.If you're reading this review and you've been abused/neglected/raped and/or forced to endure any other type of horror, KNOW THIS:Dont give up. Don't let them win. Even if we never understand why they chose us and not our sibling (s), it's ok. We don't need all the answers. We just need to love ourselves and each other enough to let the light shine in.Everything will be ok. I promise.
