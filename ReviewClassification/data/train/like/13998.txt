"Blood will have blood."Naked ambition and ruthlessness combined with superstition and entitlement belief is a strong cocktail, carefully mixed in the witches' cauldron. The spicy recipe is of course hard to digest, and only those taunted and ridiculed in their toxic masculinity by "unsexed" wives will swallow the bait and act out the disaster.Despite the centuries of democratisation that form a barrier between us and Macbeth' dream of "safe power", one recognises the brutal wish for fame and elevation in many of our contemporary players on the world stage. There is an element of blindness that needs to be cultivated to be able to be both ambitious and careless enough to use violence to grasp power illegitimately.While Macbeth and Lady Macbeth follow their ambition to gain glory, they manage to simultaneously hold the belief that:"Life's but a walking shadow, a poor playerthat struts and frets his hour upon the stage,And then is heard no more. It is a taleTold by an idiot, full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing."This tale is definitely not told by an idiot, and it signifies more than the fury it unleashes on stage. It contains the conundrum of the human condition, the neverending question why we destroy what we built to gain a loss.
