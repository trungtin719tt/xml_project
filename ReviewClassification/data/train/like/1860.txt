*** 4.5 'Shut Up,Louis' Stars ***. .. . . Okay, okay, I haven't actually read the twilight series but you have to admit Tom Cruise and Brad Pitt make a much hotter couple than Robert Pattison and Kristen Stewart. . . Or not. **liars!**To those who haven't readInterview with the Vampire( 'the' ?.. . all this time I thought it was "Interview withaVampire")because you've already watched the film---&gt;READ IT.While Hollywood managed to capture the essence of the story to a cinematic degree, in my humble opinion they fell short in regards to the characters themselves. And boy did some of the castings have me scratching my head...Most notably, Armand.So will I continue reading the series ?. . . Hell Yes! I'm hooked!
