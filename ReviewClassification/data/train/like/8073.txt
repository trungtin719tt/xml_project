Jenny crack book and I don't care! It was good!I feel like the first couple of books were wrapped up neatly in a bow by the end of the story. The last two are allowing things to remain open longer so that when you finish a book you are left wondering what will happen next. Sadly I am sure that is due to the publisher rather than the authors desire. (Wouldn't want to write a cliff hanger if you are only optioned for a single book.)So this book and the last book have left me chomping to learn more and I immediatly want to jump into the next to figure out what the hell is going on with certain plot lines. I don't want to give stuff away here- but the drama is huge and some of the things that were on back burners get moved to the front and some heat applied.On the back of the book it says that Neferet declared war on the humans, so I feel like I can mention that without being wicked ol' spoiler girl. So Zoey - barely 17 and head of the Nerd Herd - has to somehow stop a war between the vamps and the humans. Hu. No pressure there.Yeah. I keep thinking about everything that I read in this book and enjoying how everything unfolded. I broke down and got the next book in the series last night so I am diving right into Book #5 to find out wtf happens next.
