I am silent. What can I say? Here I have been, for the last year or two, searching for books on WW1. I have read fiction and non-fiction and biographies. This thin little book has more of an impact than any other I have read.This is a book to be read many times.Not only is it profound in message, but the author writes beautifully.Can humor be incorporated into a book with such a serious message? Yes, Remarque pulls this off too.This thin book perfectly captures- war in the trenches- mustard gas- being home on leave- medical care on the front- the strength of comradeship- rational and irrational fear- our innate will to livenot only with factual content, but more importantly with the emotional impact on the individual in the war. Also the impact on those not there in the trenches, not doing the fighting, but in heart out there with the combatants.This book points an incriminatory finger at all of us who let wars continue.Stunning narration by Tom Lawrence. Listen to THIS audiobook version of Remarque's masterpiece.P.S. This book doesn't throw in other issues, such as politics or romance, as so many other contemporary books do. Such topics are totally superfluous given the gravity and intensity of the central theme so well drawn with Remarque's eloquence. I will definitely be reading more by Remarque.
