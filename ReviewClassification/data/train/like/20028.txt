Khaled Hosseini kills me. His writing seems to wound me as I'm reading his books. I remember when I read the Kite Runner I had to stop for a week or so to psyche myself up to finish it because it made me so sad. (I think I must be getting soft in my old age.) His writing rides a raw edge between nostalgia and pain: you don't want bad things to happen to his characters because they are already deeply wounded by circumstance. But then another part of me gets inspired to write when I read his work. I love how he gently handles these flawed, vulnerable creatures. They are pummeled and worked over again and again, but at the same time they are also luminescent with authenticity.It's excellent.
