This is one William Shakespeare's play which I have always wanted to read and well it turned out to be as good as I expected it to be...sharp, to the point and with great dialogues/ speeches. Every plot line blended in well together and nothing seemed out of place...the Act/ scenes pertaining to Portia's suitors and the three caskets and the all famous courtroom scene in Act IV were superbly written.
