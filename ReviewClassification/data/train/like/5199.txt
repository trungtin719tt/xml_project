www.melissa413readsalot.blogspot.comThis book was so good! I can't believe I have had this book in my stacks for a few years now! The story is so bizarre and sad. I loved it!When Margaret is called upon by Vida Winter, a famous author, to come and write her biography she has no idea what she is in for with this woman.Vida tells the story of her life as a child, but she is not who she seems. The twist ending threw me right off the bus. I didn't see that one coming at all, but I should have expected something along those lines.The way the author weaves this tale is so haunting and it reels you right into the book. I can not fathom how children can be brought up this way! The story unfolds in a beautiful, well, what should be, a beautiful mansion in the countryside of London. They call the place Angelfield.This is about a family that goes beyond being dysfunctional. I want to see this on film!It is an incredibly sad story, I cried. But there is a happy ending so that is what matters.The story is a beautiful tale even though it is incredibly disturbing at times and so very sad. All of the characters and background is very rich in detail and I liked a lot of the characters.I would like to read more books from this author if they are as good as this one!
