I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I had no problem with the short sex scenes or the lack of chemistry between Vishous and Jane. But my only complaint about this one was the ending. It was strange, jarring, and too abrupt. It was kind of weird to live their lives like THAT! I thought V deserved real happiness after all he had been through! Damn! The author made them look so pathetic!When I was a little more than halfway through the stroy, I was thinking about giving this book 5 stars, but the last quarter and the ending made me reduce the rating to 4 instead.
