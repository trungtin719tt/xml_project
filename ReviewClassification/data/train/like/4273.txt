I beganThe Screwtape Lettersmany years ago and only ever managed to begin three or so pages of it before finding the style too difficult for my younger self. It is a sign to me, therefore, of my development as an individual and reader, that I was able to sit down this afternoon and finish it off in two sessions.The Screwtape Lettersis perhaps, C.S. Lewis' most nuanced and subtle work. Through providing a narrative that covers advice from a senior devil to his junior nephew, Lewis explores issues as deep as in any of his other books but with a creative twist. He explores the nature of evil, of demonic forces, as all so human - but yet spiritual at the same time - revealing that evil exists in the seductive qualities that threaten our everyday life. Evil, as Lewis explores it, is good twisted against its own powerful purpose.It is for this very reason that I can only recommend reading this book. It is a collection of creative and thought provoking letters which, as mentioned, cover the concept of Good and Evil. WhereMere Christianityshould appeal more to the Christian and the 'seeker', this is one of Lewis' works that should appeal to anyone, I believe. Therefore I definitely recommend this as a classic of fantasy mixed with faith - the best type of work that Lewis always did. As Lewis himself said, the greatest success of the Devil was to convince the world that he does not exist...
