This series is a mess. The author took it in such a weird direction and really should have stopped after 3 books. However, this series (especially this book) was actually the reason I got so heavily into reading. I was in grade 6 at school (age 11) when my friend in grade 7 told me they were reading this book in class. I begged mum to buy it for me because my friend really loved it. By the time I got to grade 7 and read it in class, I had already read the first 3 books in the series. I actually made my best friend read them too and she borrowed them from me and we used to fangirl over them. Prior to reading this, I only read really short novels - around 100-200 pages long. This was, what I would call, my first real novel. Also, it really opened my eyes to the fantasy world. I know a lot of people fell in love with reading through harry potter but I guess my reading journey was a little bit different! As much as this series is all over the place and crazy, I really owe my love for reading to it and it will always hold a very special place in my heart.
