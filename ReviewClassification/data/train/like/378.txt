I have hated words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.Liesel, an orphaned girl, is sent to live with a foster family right beforethe Nazi's take over Germany.She hasa peculiar attachmentto books, her first being a gravedigger's manual that she picks up during her brother's funeral.Death takes an interest in her and her books on that day and follows her, sometimes constantly and sometimes at a distance.There's just something so...fascinating...about herthat Death cannot stay away.Meanwhile Lieselslowly grows upin the heart of Nazi Germany.Her adoptive Papa and Mama make her bleak life bearable. But Rudy, her best friend, makes everything right in this world.A snowball in the face is surely the perfect beginning to a lasting friendship.But their idyllic lives cannot stay that way forever.Food shortages are rampart,money becomes ever tighter and Papa's son believes every word from Hitler.And throughout all of this, Death watches.... and waits.Even death has a heart.Whew. I have avoided this one for so long...and I'm so glad that Ifinally took the plunge.Normally, I dislike most books/movies/games set in Nazi Germany.I absolutely hate anything that turns that much pain and sorrow intoa gimmick to sell more of the product.I feel that a majority of that entertainment field both cheapens the experience and is hugely disrespectful to the victims.I feel like this subject should be treated delicately - and there are very few bits of media that I feel do it justice.The Book Thief was justabsolutely perfectin that sense. This book was just the right mixture of joys and sorrows, of highs and lows, and of good and evil.I loved Liesel and the way she grew up against the ever-present tide of Nazis.The way she and her familystruggled against the world,by hiding a Jew or showing sympathy, really made this book shine.Death madean interesting perspective, though I wish the book would have been narrated more from inside his head.Overall, loved this one. Though (and this may be just me), but am I the only one disappointed by the title?I really was expectinga bit more book-thievery...instead Liesel was (mostly) given the very few books that she "steals".Audiobook CommentsExtremely well-read - an absolute delight to listen to!Blog|Instagram|Twitter
