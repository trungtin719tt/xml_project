Set on the Gangetic Plain some 2,600 years ago,Siddharthais about one man's search for enlightenment. Siddhartha, son of a Brahmin, even in the presence of Gautama Buddha himself, is unable to find awayif it depends on the teachings of others. There is, Siddhartha comes to believe, no single illuminated path for all men and women to follow. We must each of us make our own mistakes. We must all suffer, and no warning against it will ever help us. For to live some kind of bizarre life of comfort that prevents suffering also prevents our finding peace. The novel's especially illuminating if you have some understanding ofVedic Religionand how it fed developments in Buddhism, Hinduism and Jainism. The writing style is very honed, lean, without abstruse digressions. It fulfills for me the fundamental requirement of all good fiction: that it reveal a fully imagined world. And isn't that what we really require from narrative: that it take us out of ourselves; that it, to paraphrase John Gardner (The Art of Fiction,Grendel,Mickelsson's Ghosts,Nickel Mountain,October Light, etc.), perpetuates the dream? Highly recommended. I much prefer it toSteppenwolf. Up nextJourney to the EastandThe Glass Bead Game.
