when i read this book, i am expecting chessey tear jearking kind of book. thats why it takes me so long to read this book.but... i am surprise. it is not chessey at all. rather it is honest, heartwarming and innocent kind of book. the point of view is from 10 years old kind. and at the end i fall in love with melody.i never think about words as much as it is now. even i am perferfectly capable talking, there are times where i am like melody. struggling with words. can not express my anger, my thought.good book.
