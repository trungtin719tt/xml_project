This was definitely a comfort read or rather a reread for me. It is a Christian-based historical fiction set in the Tennessee mountains around 1912. Christy Huddleston is a young teacher who leaves the comfort of her Asheville, NC home to minister to and teach the children of a cove set deep within Appalachia. I first read this as a teen soon after it was published, reread it in the 80s when a TV series which I loved aired based on the book and now reread once again with great fondness for the characters and for the many messages and themes within.Family, friends, hardships, endurance, determination, tolerance, understanding of a culture so different from one's own, a strong faith commitment and yes, even a tender and slowly evolving romance are all included. It shows a young girl's determination to fight for her pupils to have basic necessities for learning. It also shows the many facets of deep mountain life of the time - from feuding and bootlegging to traditions and culture carried over many generations back from the Highlands of Scotland!It is tender. It is sweet. But it is also a real glimpse into life of this time and place as it was loosely based on Catherine Marshall's mother's experience as a young teacher. I highly recommend.
