"All shall be well, and all shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well." Julian of NorwichHere is CS Lewis's attmept to comfort us with visions of heavenly truth. I think he succeeds. The first time I ever really desired Heaven was after reading this as a 19yo young married girl. Today as I finished reading it to my student, I felt my heart ache again longingly. I ache for that heavenly realty.As I read off each of the people the children were finding in the "further up and further in" Narnia, Drake, my student, would jump out of his chair and hoot for joy. You gotta love a 12 year old boy!I found myself happiest to see Puddleglum again.I hope I am not saying goodbye to Narnia forever. Gotta figure out a way to have Zoom read alouds with my grandchildren.
