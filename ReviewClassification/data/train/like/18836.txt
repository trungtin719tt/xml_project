What an magical book...I loved Lost Lake and I believe that I love Garden Spells just as much. The characters are so real yet magical and mystical at the same time. Sarah has such an amazing ability to create deep characters with so much emotion - they just draw you in and you love each and every one of them.The Waverly women are such strong women, even if they don't quite know that about themselves right away.The story takes place in Bascom, North Carolina in a quaint home with an amazing garden that grows at night as well as during the day. These items in the garden seem to have powers in different ways for people who eat them. They may see things, think things, act a certain way.Claire has lived in the home for some time alone after her grandmother passed away. Sydney had been gone for over ten years and then she comes back into town to get away from her daughter's father who has been abusing her. She feels that the Waverly home is the only place that she and her daughter Bay are truly safe.Each day Claire and Sydney seem to build that bond of sisterhood that they never really had growing up. Sydney helps Claire open up to life and letting people in, Bay is learning that she has powers and how they help her through her life and Sydney is learning that it's not too bad to be a Waverly, a life she once ran from.
