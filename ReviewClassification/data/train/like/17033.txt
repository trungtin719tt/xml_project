Yet another excellent book by Tim Butcher. This time the author treks through the Balkans on the trail of the assassin who's fatal shooting of Archduke Franz Ferdinand was the trigger for a political disaster waiting to happen and precipitated WW1 and ultimately all the further horrors on WW2.I must admit to always feeling rather foolish not understanding the more recent Balkan conflict which claimed, among many lives, the army officer husband of a friend of mine who was killed before his baby daughter was even born. Tim Butcher brilliantly explains all the conflicting nationalities and religions involved, tracing their evolution back to the time of the Ottoman empire.As is usual with his writing, it never feels like a dry history lesson as he intermingles it with anecdotes from his time as a front-line war reporter covering the 90s conflict along with the very real characters he meets on his present day travels. I am now much clearer on why there has continued to be such terrible turmoil in these lands and how these inter tribal conflicts still impact on Europe as a whole.Our family have always passed Butcher's books around until they become quite tattered such is our fervour in devouring his works....this will be another of them!
