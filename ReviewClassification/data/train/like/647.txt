My first reaction when the read was over is why on earth it took me this long to read this beautiful work of Shakespeare having it physically with me all this long. Perhaps, I thought I didn't really need to read since I know the story from the movie adaptations I have watched. How foolish I have been! I had no idea what I had missed for this long.I have never enjoyed Shakespearean writing as much as I did in this play. It is passionate, lyrical and humorous. It is amazing that you find all these in a tragedy; only a great master can accomplish that feat. The story is both romantic and tragic, as we well know. But what is incredible is that the play is a "beautiful" tragedy.This is one of the most outstanding plays that I have read. I loved it very very much. I haven't read many Shakespearean tragedies, only other being King Lear. And in my mind no tragedy could outmatch the tragic tale of Romeo and Juliet which will undoubtedly be my favourite Shakespearean tragedy.
