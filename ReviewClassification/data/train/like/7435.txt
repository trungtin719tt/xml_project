A book about knots. You know, nautical knots, fisherman's knots, each chapter beginning with a sketch of the intricate knot and its name.And I can only tie my shoes. On a good day.I don't remember nautical terms. They are lost on me. Always have been. If the ship goes down, it's going down with me.But I know knots. A knot at the base of my throat, an edgy knot taking over my stomach, a knot where my colon used to be.And, reading this unnerving masterpiece, you feel the knots. Because disaster looms in every page of this beauty. Disaster. A little like life, but worse. Life in Newfoundland.Horrible, near-grotesque people. People you would never want to know, or date. Food I would never touch, outside of starvation.And OUTSTANDING writing, as in STANDS OUT from anything I've ever read in my life. Luminous, poetic, inspired writing. As good as Morrison or Faulkner, but funny, too. I shook my head in awe, shook my head on every page, as I swallowed around the knots in my neck.This novel left me shipwrecked.
