It's one of my hobbies to read the books which come up in movies or tv series. I don't know why it makes me happy! So, for this one, I have to thank Chandler Bing from FRIENDS! :DI totally loved this book! It reminded me of 'Toy Story' though, my all time favorite animated film!Awwww, the velveteen rabbit! My eyes were almost teary until the fairy came! :'(Beautiful book with some beautiful writings! ^_^
