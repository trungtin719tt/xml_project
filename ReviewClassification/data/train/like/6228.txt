In times of darkness and great need, we look for a hero.Book 1:The backstory and a particularly intriguing story of freedom versus justice emerges in this postnuclear apocalyptic story. Tick-tock, times up for some very bad people. I also recall why my farmboy friends are not stupid. I had a machete and gasoline, and they... well, I'd have been a bigger fan of chemistry, too. The things you learn playing in the shed.Book 2:The saga continues, but this time we see Evey and her trajectory. There is an intersection with V and the past and how they have led to now. This is the mindfuck stage and entertaining when you see where it leads.Book 3:The future is here. The baton is passed. Do you take it?I actually found this more cogent than the movie version. While the cinema was beautifully shot, this showed the transitions better, albeit in a longer fashion rather than a few cuts. The power and depth of V as an entity and the use of letter is sketched out better. I liked the movie, but this was superior.
