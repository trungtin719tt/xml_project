Wicked Lovely wasn't a book I loved.Despite having it in my wishlist for months,and getting so excited when I read it finally,it disappointed me so much.I even gave up the book after a few pages.So when I stumbled upon it's sequel,I have no idea why I bought it.Well,maybe I knew.It's the cover which did the magic.I mean,who says no to that cover?It seduced me in first glance.So it's fair to say that I was pleasantly surprised to find this book enjoyable.Unlike Aislinn who bored me so much in Wicked Lovely,Leslie's character was great,which I think is the main reason I like this book.Another thing that was better in this one is the heroes.Unlike the first book,I can't actually find out who the main hero is.Irial or Niall.It was really confusing to me to say the truth.I preferred Irial to Niall.He managed me make me love him,even though his character was as dark as midnight.So overall the book was okay to me.But that doesn't mean I'll ever read the sequels.End of my chronicles with the faeries.
