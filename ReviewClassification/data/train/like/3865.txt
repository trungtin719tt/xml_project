I finished the whole book, and then began again to savor not only the story and the wonderful writing, but the lessons to be found here. As a lapsed Catholic, I lost my feeling for such things. But in this book I found it all again. I don't know if it's true, but if this book is read by only religious people or by seekers of spiritual wisdom, that's a loss to readers looking for fully realized characters and great tragedy and exciting adventure. The grounding of the book in real history, and actual philosophy is another of its wonders. Ridiculous? I find it ridiculous for someone to call a book, almost any book ridiculous after only three chapters. There are classics I fought my way into only to find that my persistence paid off enormously.
