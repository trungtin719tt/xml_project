"I have been intoxicated more than once, my passions have never been far off insanity."Although I have some sympathy for unrequited love, it was hard for me to understand Werther. My feelings toward him went back and forth between sympathy and frustration. At times I admired his love, at other times I found it to be very obsessive. Yes, he was sensitive and romantic, but the woman of his dreams did not lead him on in any way so I did find the way he behaved quite incomprehensible.This was my first Goethe and it won't be my last.I love how he writes, and I enjoyed his philosophical musings, and his meditations on life, love, religion, people, etc. He made some interesting points although some of them did seem to come from an elitist's point of view.
