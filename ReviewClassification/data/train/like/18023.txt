BEST GILLIAN FLYNN BOOK. By a mile. Sorry, Gone Girl, you are no longer welcome here. (Just kidding I'm probably going to reread it in one absolute second but will it be as good as this book? No, it will not.)This is so CREEPY and the writing is so visceral and it's so unique. There have probably been thrillers like this one since this one, but definitely not many before.There are so many characters that are just hopelessly fascinating. Like, all of them, basically. Any time the protagonist gets into a conversation with any human person it's a goddamn treat because everyone is so interesting and confusing and you just want to know everything about everyone!!!Flynn also has this fantastic crazy writing style that you feel and picture so hard. VeryVirgin Suicides. There are turns of phrase in this book I read four times and promptly filed away as "you will remember this at random points for the rest of your life."I don't even know what to say beyond this is a whole new level of good. You have no idea. If the HBO adaptation doesn't do it justice I will goddamn picket the home of Amy Adams with a protest sign but also HOW COULD IT DO IT JUSTICE.I'm a mess. And I'm not even mad about it.Bottom line: How is this Gillian Flynn's first book??? How is this any non-deal-with-devil-having person's first book????? How is this a book?????-------------me: yeah i can reread this before the show premieres...even though i haven't finished a book in almost a week...and i have to read another book in its entirety today for school....and the show premieres in less than 9 hours.sure no problem!!!! gillian flynn come thru
