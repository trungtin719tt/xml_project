This book was recommended to by the lovelyMAYFLOWER! And boy, do I have a lot of gratitude that she pulled this book to the forefront of my TBR list.I'm gonna be honest, when I first started reading this I didn't find myself immediately drawn into the story. I was like that new kid in a group that's sort of hanging out on the edge of conversation, listening but not really participating.But then I saw the light.Things started to come together for me once Taylor began to pursue the truth of her past. But looking back, the beginning being on the slower side gave me a chance to get to know the characters and so I'm not going to say that it's a bad thing overall.It seems like the only other issue I had with this book could also be chalked up to personal preference and not something that'sobjectivelywrong with the story. I just didn't love the setting of the Townies vs. Cadets vs. Students. Before things came into clearer focus I was thinking:"What the fuck? People are actually getting hurt? These are school-aged kids? Whaaaat?"But this setting does begin to feel much more appropriate once you get a bit further in.God, everyone in this novel was so intense.Once I started realizing what was going on, who was who, and why certain things were relevant... Damn. My heart was beating so fast while making these discoveries, and they are all individually andmagnificently devastating.This is a book that slowly sinks its claws into you, and before you know it you're caught.And once you're caught, there's no getting out until the end.The end broke my heart into so many pieces. I'm still picking them up. Such a wonderfully genuine and heartfelt story, with characters that come walking right out of the pages to meet you. This book is an intricately woven web of love and tragedy.I'm so glad that I've read this, and I feel it will have an impact on me long after I write this review.
