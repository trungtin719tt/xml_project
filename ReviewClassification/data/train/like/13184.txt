Delivered in her trademark style, Kelley creates a world within our own where supernatural teens are nothing but science projects to be shown and used then tossed away--sometimes even killed.Chloe's character becomes even clearer in this novel then the one preceding it, and boy is being in her head interesting. She is struggling to understand how strong she is, and is no where near the point where she can control her powers. Despite her interest in her powers, Chloe would much rather be normal again--what ever that means, as she no longer knows herself.Although with too little romance for my taste, The Awakening is an even better read than The Summoning. There is never a slow moment in their journey or a false line in Kelley's writing. The Awakening is a perfect edge-of-your seat read with plenty of surprises. Not only is this a great YA read, but it also is fitting for adults as well.Kelley has created a gritty, realistic world, one that Horror, Sci-fi, and Paranormal readers will love. Book II in the Darkest Powers trilogy takes us even farther into a world where the supernatural intrudes on the everyday life with riveting effect, and has a clear DO NOT ENTER sign that you will try to ignore. An amazing novel! I want the next installment now!Leah:) fromwww.trunerd.blogspot.com
