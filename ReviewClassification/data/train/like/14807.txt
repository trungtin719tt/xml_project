I loved this book from the get-go. In spite of labor disputes, food shortages and a near-death experience for the hero, Huw Morgan, the upbeat tone carried through in what to me was a soothing manner.How Green Was My Valleyoffers the reader to step into pre-industrialized Wales and watch the traditions, customs slip away as times change. Slip away as do the younger generation lured by London, America and a chance to make a name for themselves through pursuit of military careers. The story follows Huw Morgan through the course of his life focusing on his coming-of-age years and how his beliefs were formed and the lessons he learns along the way.Huw's beliefs are influenced heavily by his parents, brothers and village preacher. The preacher doesn't fit the traditional mold often opting for mercy over church rules.The language and color of this book is beautiful to behold. As I listened to the audio version I felt like I had walked into the story.Many of my friends mentioned they had read this book in high school. I'm glad I didn't because I wouldn't have appreciated it as much as I do today.All-in-all, I was sad to finish this book, but am glad to count it as one of my favorites.
