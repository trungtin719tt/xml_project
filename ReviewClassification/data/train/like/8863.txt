Emily Dickinson left a large cache of poetry -- 900 poems hand-sewn together in 60 small packets -- which her sister Lavinia discovered after Emily's death. The poems were untitled and mostly undated. Lavinia realized she had unearthed a literary treasure trove, and sought help in getting the poems published.Early editors of Dickinson's work (notably her brother's mistress, Mabel Loomis Tood) trying to be helpful, edited some of Dickinson's idiosyncratic poetry to make it more acceptable to the modern taste.Thisedition, edited by Thomas H. Johnson, erases those early changes and offers readers the "only authoritative paperback collection of all of Emily Dickinson's poetry."Following a brief (and helpful) biography of the Amherst genius, Johnson assembles and numbers Dickinson's poetry by the estimated date that each poem was written. This arrangement gives the reader insight into what might have been occurring in Emily Dickinson's life at the time of creation.The book can be approached via the usual read -- from front to back -- however, I loved just openingThe Complete Poemsat random and diving into whatever poems emerged from the pages. Once submerged in the fluidity of Dickinson's genius, I felt like a fish leaping up from the black depth attempting to catch a transcendent truth that alighted momentarily like a fly atop the smooth water. The spirit of the poetess and her artistic grace move elusively and fluidly through the pages, perennially present, and, in some cases prescient.If you're looking for an opportunity to meet the woman, Emily Dickinson, personally -- perhaps slipping through her backyard flowers and herbs in her trademark white dress --The Complete Poems of Emily Dickinsonoffers an open gate to the garden. You won't catch her, but you'll smell the scent of the rosemary as she passes. And if you enlarge your vision, you might spy Dickinson's essence in a single flower:The Grace - Myself - might not obtain -Confer upon My flower -Refracted but a Countenance -For I - inhabit Her -(Emily Dickinson poem #707, circa 1863, 1st published in 1935)
