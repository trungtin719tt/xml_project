Poor Edgar, always so sad, but he sure can write a terrifying story. I wonder if it was the drugs he was on, of if this state of mind made him turn to the drugs. Either way he was a master of the macabre, and he always caught your attention.I think this is where my fascination with this type of literature began.No one wrote like Poe. No one left you hanging, literally, walled in, literally,and figuratively, like Poe. He could tap into our basest fear, anger and regret.make victims, beg for mercy, and yet understand why people did the terrible things they did. Some have even tried to copy his methods, years, decades, centuries after his untimely death.His paranoia became ours. His terror was so well crafted that it has satyed with for a lifetime. We don't forget his stories. EVER!
