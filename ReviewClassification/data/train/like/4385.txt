Ella Enchanted is like a koala. A big, soft, cute koala.And if you mess with it, it'll use it's big, sharp, not-so-cute claws to tear your face off.Seriously.It's just a cute little fairy tale for teenage girls about a silly little world. Accept it for what it is. Leave it at that. Don't delve any futher. Don't consider it from a feminine perspective, don't rationalize it from a historical stand-point, don't try to analyze is for hidden metaphors or literary value.Just read, rinse, repeat and move on.[image error]http://x92.xanga.com/639b1b4678130299...You do NOT want a face full of this!ETA: I have just seen the movie for Ella Enchanted. Trust Disney to f*#$ everything up! Cary Elwis, what have they done to you!
