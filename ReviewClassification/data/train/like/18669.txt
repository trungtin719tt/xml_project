Great book for a retreat! Spiritually invigorating, makes one excited about the Catholic faith. It is fiction with references to standard Catholic tradition, and is set in the time of the Christian persecutions in Rome during the reign of Nero. The focus of the novel is a love story between a Roman centurion and a beautiful Christian princess-in-exile. The story's central conflict takes place in the person of the centurion's friend, who also happens to be a cultural lackey in the court of Nero. And there is great action provided by the princesses personal bodyguard, who probably would have been competitive in the WWF.Sienkiewicz's view of Christianity is strikingly progressive for his time. While he makes a remarkably strong effort to unite sexual desire into conversion and Christian love, there remain strong hints of 19th century romanticism.In the end we find out that Sienkiewicz's ultimate goal is not necessarily spiritual but historical. The climax of the book has St Peter making eye contact with Nero, the great transition in history marking the passing of the old worldly order to a new other-worldly order. Yes, Saints Peter and Paul do make several cameos in this story.I liked it very much.
