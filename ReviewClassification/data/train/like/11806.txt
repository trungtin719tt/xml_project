haha, haven't been reading a bunch of Nicholas Sparks's books lately...I have no idea how the movie is, but it must be far beyond the level of this book. But the ending is SOOOO damn sad. Seriously.And because of that thing called my short-term memory span, I can't remember their names, so I'll just phrase it with pronouns. :DSo she finds a message in a bottle (thus the name) and falls in love with the way the man (OMG, I REMEMBERED HIS NAME, just now :P) writes and expresses his most definete true-to-heart feelings. Her friend is positive that giving it publicity would help her find the guy (since she's a newspaper publisher or whatever). And it does. She is able to find 2 more and has a clue about where the guy is and takes a trip there just to see what he's like. She meets him quite randomly at the docks and they fall in love. Through obstacles I have no mood to explain, they get so close to making a decision about their future, but Garret (the guy) ruins it by hanging too close to his past. And in the end, a life was lost and a life changed forever. :] How adorable, huh? X]
