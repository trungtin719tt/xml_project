Hallucinogenic Drugs, Virtual Sex, Alienated People.Brave New Worldis a futuristic novel, traced byAldous Huxley, who was considered one of the greatest prophetic writers of the 20th century; Aldous, who wrote about the effect of LSD and mescaline, brought from his hallucinogenic sessions ideas that were at the very least intriguing, so much so that some renowned scientists at the time chose him for research into the effect of hallucinogens on humans.Aldous used drugs, had hallucinations and an assistant was taking notes on his way back from his delirium began to write without stopping, producing works like this and others likeIsland, plus also thePoint Counter Pointwork, all taken as maximum of the author works.InBrave New World, Aldous describes a perfect society, possibly located in Europe, that was dominated by a single ruler, where the state distributed a drug calledSOMAto the citizens, and all had a very calm life, without stress and that helped in the discipline of all inhabitants; In addition to this collective doping strategy, the state provided cinemas where the audience was connected to the sensory terminals and accompanied the films knowing sensations, taste and smell coming directly from the screen; the sex was divided into two parts, one for pleasure and another for prosecution, the latter depended on a state authorization and the first was free since there was no carnal copulation, ie there was no direct contact between people, which eliminated the carnal intercourse of relationships, connecting to special terminals, conveyed to each other the sensations of sex, through the mind and not of the carnal body.Several children were born in a test tube, adapting them to future situations, those who were working in the basement were raised from a fetus in a dark room, others who would be soldiers, were taught by electroshocks not to appreciate nature, flowers and wild animals.The fascination of this literature, beyond the context, is that Aldous described all this writing around the year 1913, when the world was still preparing for the first great world war, trench warfare, without any technology at all. No one dared to think, much less talk about test-tube children and sensory terminals were unimaginable, mankind had barely gotten used to the use of the telephone, there was no television, cinema was a work recently released by the genius Chaplin, still in black and white and mute.In the book, Aldous makes special mention of a region that would have been shielded from the power of the state, where wholly savage people lived, preserving customs of food, sex, and freedom unrelated to the present stage, this paradisiacal place, described by Huxley, in that fiction written in the moments of his hallucination, was Brazil, with its forests and people.
