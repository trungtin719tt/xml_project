I can't help but let the book speak for itself:"Horror stories make some kind of sense. There's a monster of some sort. An infinite variety of monsters. In horror stories you either get eaten by the monster or you have to defeat the monster. Ghost stories have their own kind of sense. Something truly haunts a place. Or it haunts a person. A demon, the newly dead, a force, usually ill intended. But this story makes no sense at all."It's very atmospheric, it goes as deep as you want it to, it can be interpreted in as many - or as few - ways as you wish.The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars, not 5, is that at times it can get almost *too* uncaring about making sense. Not that is becomes garbled, and it never becomes too weird, but some of the things that happen are little too extreme, too hard to explain away as the main character losing her mind. It's The Yellow Wallpaper, but not as subtle as that story, which kind of makes it a little less effective. BUT, that's only my interpretation of it, because I *want* that interpretation, because I like it best.I could put a "but maybe not" after every sentence in that last paragraph and it would still be true. It's a remarkable book, I know I'll be thinking about it for quite a while.
