If you know me, then you may know that I've tried to read fairytales from the Grimm Brothers, Hans Christian Anderson, and from the collection of Arabian Nights and have been unable to finish any of them because I honestly didn't like the stories and thought they were overly preachy and odd.This, however, will be the book of fairytales that I read to my future children. I fucking loved it. The stories were a mix of wonder and darkness, of hope and love, and the extra notes from both Dumbledore and Jo were the perfect addition to this wonderful little book. I only wish there were more stories! What a gem!
