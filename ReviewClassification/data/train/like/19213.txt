The Book of Disquietis less a novel, more the diary of a sensitive and reflective outsider: a dreamer, who compulsively chronicles his contemplations, believing them to be the true manifestation of his soul (ignore the awkward blundering fool who stands before you,these wordsare the real me!); who lives apart from humanity and imagines a future in which his genius will finally be understood and celebrated... Is it any wonder this book is so beloved by writers?Much has already been written of the brilliant poetic style, and the trenchant and memorable aphorisms, so I will instead write about what is not so often discussed: though this work is idealised by many, there is much here to be conflicted about. Pessoa (or Soares, if you prefer, though I suspect the name is less an adopted persona than a thin, disinhibiting mask), writes from a position of such inhuman remoteness, that only through a charitable reading of his philosophy may one discover truths that are morally defensible. Surely if one takes seriously his views, for example on political disengagement (one should quietly submit even to unjust rule), on living apart from humanity ("you are only free if you can withdraw from men"), life and death ("death is liberation because to die is to need no one else"), et cetera - there are a multitude of other examples which I unfortunately cannot provide due to my ineptitude at gathering quotes as I read - surely as incongruous as these views are to non-misanthropes, they cannot be held up as valid moral axioms, and can only be admired in the abstract, on the assumption that they are not opinions sincerely held, but merely a form of poetic expression, which is understood to be romantically overstated, so that in its diminution and its dilution with the banal and the commonplace, some profound ideal may be glimpsed. And there is real value in what can be discovered inThe Book of Disquiet, but one must take care not to romanticise Soares's detachment and remoteness, or mistake the actualisation of these as one's aim, for there are better ways to perceive the world.The Book of Disquietgot me thinking about the relationship between suffering and art. While it's true that suffering is not a prerequisite for great art - one must be talented, but is not required to be unhappy in order to pen a great symphony, or create a masterful sculpture - I wonder if the same holds true for great literature, which is so much more a direct expression of the artist's mind, lacking as it does the interstitial abstraction of other artistic mediums. I suppose one cannot make a blanket statement about such things, but I suspect that to write something likeThe Book of Disquiet, one needs to contain in one's self, more than a just a sliver of Soares.
