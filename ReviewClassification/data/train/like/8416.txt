So far, this has been my favorite book in the House of Night series. Chosen (book #3) brings forth a lot of changes in the world of the House of Night. Zoey is dealing with the loss of people as well as a tragic birthday incident. To add to all of that she has the admiration of three guys, she's trying to save someone, and life as she knows it is pretty much going to chaos and destruction around her.What I enjoyed the most about this particular book in the series was that for the first time, in my opinion, Zoey made mistakes and there were consequences for the mistakes that she made. Zoey has been doing a pretty good job and making mistakes and people right away either forgiving her, or simply telling her that she has a lot to learn. In this book, that wasn't the case. She made mistakes, she was heart broken, and for once people didn't forgive her for the mistakes she made which makes the story seem all the more real. I love when characters make mistakes simply because we all make mistakes it's part of who we are. When Zoey made mistakes in this novel and had to deal with the consequences of those mistakes it made me, as a reader, like her more because I could relate and sympathize with her.More exciting, nerve-racking, and intense things are sure to come in the next House of Night book, Untamed. I'm not sure where it's going to go and I'm not sure how Zoey is going to deal with the things to come. But I know that I am excited to see what's in store for everyone at The House of Night! :)
