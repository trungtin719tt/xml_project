I realize that I need to edit one particular part, but this review means a lot to me and I would like for it to stay the way it was written, regardless of the revalations and events that took place later.Beautifully written and emotionally draining. However, this isn't simply a tale of terror. It is a philosophical and, I suppose, historical work as well. (I learned interesting historical facts). Who among us are sinners? Who are the righteous ones? Are people and deeds simply right or wrong, good and evil? Dante weeps for all the souls condemned to eternal torture. Yet, he seems rather certain that they deserve their fate. If so, why does he weep for them? If we believe someone worthy of our tears, aren't they worthy of our forgiveness as well? I believe in the importance of integrity. I admire people to whom moral is important. I am one of them and I have often been angry towards those, who I consider cruel. However, I would always choose the sinner who sins, but also forgives, over the saint who never sins, but never forgives either. I am borrowing the closing words of Steve Sckenda's review of Anna Karenina. "Inevitably, others will judge us. May our judges look upon our love rather than upon our sin. May they crush us with mercy."Read count: 1
