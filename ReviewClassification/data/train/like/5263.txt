This is a pretty hefty novel, but so worth it!It covers an expanse of characters' history - the main one being Homer, a young boy brought up in an orphanage his entire life. The orphanage is connected to a hospital where secret abortions are performed.Homer becomes assistant to Dr. Larch and learns the trade, before having a moral struggle, and chooses to leave the orphanage to live with a couple who have recently visited.He moves to their farm, where they grow apples to make cider and Homer's life changes for ever.I love this novel, it is one of my favourites and put Irving's books at the top of my list.Anyone who has an interest in American history and in depth character studies - go for it, you won't be disappointed!
