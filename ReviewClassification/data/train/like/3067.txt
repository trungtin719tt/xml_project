4.5 stars. A classic story of a poor young boy in the Ozarks, saving his money for two years to buy two redbone coon hounds: a male (Old Dan) and a runt female (Little Ann.) Together always, they become the best racoon hunters in the area, eventually competing for a top award. Lots of adventures for the trio, whose companionship is indefatigable. Not sure how I missed this one growing up...
