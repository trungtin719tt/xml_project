I fell in love with Anne of Prince Edward Island when I was 13. I remember that summer vividly. I brought home each book in the series from the library and read them avidly. Anne and her simple troubles were such a contrast to my divorcing/fighting parents.I was looking for a way to avoid my summer/homework reading (an assignment from our principal) when I spotted an Anne book on my classroom bookshelf. I snarfed it up.I was once told that the definition of a classic novel was a book which could be read at almost any age and the reader would find new insights each time.This time as I read, I noticedL.M. Montgomerydescriptive ability. I focused on how she described colors, especially. She didn't use fancy words; she used shared experiences. The sky wasn't the indigo, azure, or sapphire, rather the sky was the blue of a cold December day. I'd like to learn her descriptive technique.I also enjoyed howL.M. Montgomerydeals with death. Death isn't a way of adding tragedy or drama to life; it's simply part of life. The circle of life, if you will, involves death.I think I'll be adding "visit Prince Edward Island" to my bucket list. I also think I'm going to look into checking out the entire series from the library. I've fallen back in love with Anne.
