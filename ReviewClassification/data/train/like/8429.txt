Kevin Ansbro, author of Kinnara, reminded me of this book...( having just read "The Translation in Love".Although both stories are different...the history is heartwrenching of how the American - and Canadian- Japanese were treated during and post WWII.I just saw that the author has a new book of 'short stories' coming out. "Snow Falling on Cedars" was a beautiful book. I must have read it before I was a Goodreads member -- (I still remember his 'writing'). Always did want to read another book by this author!
