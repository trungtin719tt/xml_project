You know, one of the greatest poems of the 20th century and that kind of thing. I must know a fair amount of it by heart.Here's a story about "The Waste Land" that some people may find amusing. Many years ago, when I was an undergraduate in Cambridge, a friend of mine asked me for advice on how to impress female Eng Lit majors. Well, I said, you could do worse than use The Waste Land. Just memorise a few lines, and you'll probably be able to bluff successfully.We did some rehearsals, and eventually agreed on the following script. He would start off by quoting the first few lines:"April is the cruellest month, breedingLilacs out of the dead land, mixingMemory and desire, stirringDull roots with spring rain."And then he would say, But that's not my favourite bit! and quote the following:"What are the roots that clutch, what branches growOut of this stony rubbish? Son of man,You cannot say, or guess."He tried it out a couple of times, and it worked! Female Eng Lit majors, I apologise for assisting with this deception. It wasn't very nice of me.
