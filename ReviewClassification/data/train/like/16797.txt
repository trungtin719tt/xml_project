In this third book of Ben Peller's "To Live" trilogy, he makes a dramatic and impressive shift from the styles of its two prequels. This book focuses on Shawn Michals' return to his home island, and its turmoil is reflected both in the inhabitants and Shawn (or Rusty? Ben?) himself. A very powerful work that caught me by surprise. I enjoyed "To Live and Drink In L.A." and "To Live and Love In L.A.," but I loved this one. Reminiscent of Hermann Hesse's "Steppenwolf" in that it fuels self-discovery along with the emergence of an entire society.
