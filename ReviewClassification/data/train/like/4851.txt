I saw the movie Agora and even though it wasn't quite the best movie I've seen, I became fascinated by the lead character, Hypatia of Alexandria. So I went looking for a book about her and this is what I found. Finding this book alone was worth sitting through the overlong Agora. I don't know my history but it seems the writer does, and the way she presents it is so alive. The book's vitality crackles. The city, the huge conflict as the Christian church seeks to dominate all minds, the disintigration of Rome (at least the Rome of the west), and the last of the free and tolerant early mystery teachings...exemplified by a magnificent woman called Hypatia. I was engrossed from first page to last. This is one of my keepers. Now to find anything else Longfellow has written.
