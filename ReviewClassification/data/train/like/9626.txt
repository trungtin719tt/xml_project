A modern play, to me, about disillusionment. Main characters include Amanda (delusional, childish, dependent, desparate mother), Laura (inhibited, painfully shy daughter), Tom (restless, dreamer, poet, narrator/son), Jim (optimistic, hopeful, gentleman caller). A play about misdirected dreams and ambitions. Amanda places her dreams in her children. Tom places his dreams in adventure and traveling the world like his absentee father. Laura places her dreams of happiness in her glass menagerie collection. But these dreams are misplaced, and instead only become desparate attempts to escape from realities. These people try their hardest to maintain their sense of happiness by losing themselves in their fantasies, but the peace of mind that comes from their escapism is fragile and fleeting. Disillusionment adds a heavy burden to their very ordinary existences, and only drives them to further retreat in their dreams of better, more fulfilling lives.
