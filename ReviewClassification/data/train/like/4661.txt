This gets five reviews because it was my favorite book as a child and I still understand its appeal decades later. If it hadn't been a childhood favorite, I would have given it four stars.Interestingly, I had not remembered the storyline of violence and loss that led to Karana, the protagonist, being stranded on the island. The new introduction highlights this in a way that would be difficult for children reading it now to miss it as central to the story. While having to suspend disbelief regarding just how well Karana manages on the island, her resourcefulness and befriending of animals on the island is lovely and stands the test of time.I am going to give the book to a couple of pre-adolescents who are avid readers to see how it resonates for them.
