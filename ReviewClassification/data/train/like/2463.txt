A strange cat invades the house of little Sally and her brother. With their mother away and with only a little fish to object and to become the voice of reason, the Cat in the Hat can do basically whatever he wants.This is basically a silly story without deeper meanings.Don't wonder why the children are left alone in the house or why they let the cat in.And in a similar way do not wonder why the cat wears a hat ( maybe because it rhymes??) and how it is possible for the fish to talk (maybe because it is funny that one of the most quite animals can actually talk and present some valid arguments??).Anyway, this is an excellent book for children who have just started reading.My favourite part is the appearance of Thing One and Thing Two!
