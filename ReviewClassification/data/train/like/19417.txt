The bookOut of my mindis the saddest book I've read, ever. I normally never cry when reading books but for this book I was balling. The main character is Melody who can't walk or move most of her body. She sometimes gets ignored and bullied by the way she looks and does things, but mostly by two girls Molly and Clair. They always leave Melody out and whisper and laugh even though Melody has perfect hearing. Melody can't talk though, she has i the biggest and brightest mind in her grade if not school!! She also has a thing or two things (that if she could talk) say to Molly and Clair. One day Melody finds out about this Medi- talker thing and wants it so bad, after 30 minutes or so of trying to figure out what Melody wants by pointing hysterically at the computer, her mom orders it. Once the Medi-talker comes in the mail Melody feels like she can now finally express herself. Once Melody gets to school everyone is in ahhh. Melody can finally do want she has been wanting to do for her whole life... Try out for the trivia team. She makes it with one of the high test scores and leads her team to the championships, only to find out that her team leaves her at home and goes on an earlier plane. The plane they were originally going to go on got canceled, so Melody was stuck at home and couldn't help but cry the whole time. When her team comes back they apologize and explained why they didn't intentionally leave her. She couldn't get over it for a few days then she goes back to being her cheerful, loving, fun personality self.This book is realistic fiction, and can happen anyday and anytime to you or your friends, so i think you should be grateful for what you have and when you have it. I recommend this book to people who love on/off switches of sad to happy (but mostly happy :), I loved this book and I think you should read it to.
