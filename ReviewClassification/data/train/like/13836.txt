Hands-down my favorite DiscWorld novel.From the perfectly twisted and filigreed mind of Terry Pratchett we have a book that addresses why religion starts stupid and only gets dumber. And no religion is spared!Brutha is a child-like novice in his religious order, and he will never achieve anything more than novice status. Until one day his god literally falls from the sky and realizes that Brutha is the only person in his entire religion who actually *believes* and isn't just going through the motions.This is a problem for the Great God Om, because a god's power is directly proportional to the number of his believers.Somehow Om has got to make Brutha the simpleton into a fire-breathing prophet, so people will BELIEVE again, and restore Om's power.Or else Om is doomed to returning to the desert, a wisp of a thought, banished with the other "Small Gods"...
