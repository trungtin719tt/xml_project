This is a very sad book, in the sense that it makes you think, "What the hell happened to Baghdad?". Here, Baghdad is pretty much the most magical city in the world, and most of the Arabian Nights takes place in or around it. The world of the Arabian Nights is amazingly liberal compared to Europe of the same period (which is roughly the 13th century), especially when it comes to women. From the storytelling heroine Scheherazade on down, most of the women of the Arabian Nights are well-educated and have minds of their own, even the ones who are slaves. That's more than anyone can say for the Grimm's female protagonists.My favorite story, though, is the one of Prince Carazdan and his wife Princess Badoura. The first part reminds me of A Midsummer Night's Dream, in which a prince and a princess who both have no interest in love or marriage become the subjects of a contest between a fairy and a genie. The second part of the story is also quite Shakespearean, as it involves Princess Badoura dressing as a man and becoming a king through her own merit, although she ends up getting married to a woman along the way and a comedy of errors ensues.Anyway, it's a great collection of fairytales as well as a fascinating cultural study. I highly recommend it.
