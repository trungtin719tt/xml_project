I'd seen all the 5-star ratings, but wasn't sure what to expect. I haven't read a lot of Christian fiction. This reads more like fantastic historical fiction. You never forget the story's purpose, after all Haddassah is a Christian and constantly struggles with her faith and her desire to convert her Roman family, but there's more violence, sex, and drama in this novel than in a soap opera. And it's beautifully written and narrated, too. I thought it was awesome!
