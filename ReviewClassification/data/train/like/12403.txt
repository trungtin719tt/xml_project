Another great book in the series. Sam who is now human to stay, is back in his bookstore living what he dreamed is the perfect life. Grace is happy and content to be with Sam. Everything seems fine till Grace starts to get sick. It starts with a headache and a fever....Cole is one of the new wolfs to the pack. He wanted this and choose it. He wants to escape life and just be a wolf. He meets Isabel who helps him after he turns human. There are sparks here. A new romance on the horizon? Is Cole learning that human isn't all that bad to be?I am truly loving this series. As I had mentioned in my review of Shiver. I find this to be mostly romance/young adult genre but with fantasy/paranormal as more of a side note really. There seems to be a second romance happening as well between Cole and Isabel, but not the same as the Sam and Grace romance. Both Cole and Isabel are distant. They don't like to show weakness or real emotion. It's a spark born of damage. I find it refreshing and a great contrast to the main romance.Grace's relationship with her parents is also changing. Although I certainly wouldn't call them the worst parents in the world, they still get a crappy medal for be some pretty aweful parents in my opinion, and Grace is done putting up with it.A great read. Starting the 3rd book Forever now. Won't stop till I finish all 4 books in the series.
