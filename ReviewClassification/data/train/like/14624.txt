This book was different in two ways. First, it was written in one person's point of view, the male character. Second, it is not a story about two people meeting and falling in love. No. These couple met and married each other. And the story starts off thirty years later. This book was so adorable. I thought it was realistic and it had zero percent cheesiness. I learned a lot about marriage from Wilson, the husband. I learned that marriage is a battle everyday where you have to fight to keep the romance alive. I also learned that in order to keep your marriage strong, you have to appreciate, compliment and listen to your spouse. And always be there and make them know that you'll always be there for them. What else can I say about this book? I loved the surprise ending of course! Nicholas always writes the best conclusions. And I am proud to say that i knew what would happen even though it wasn't obvious. Still, i was totally surprised! I also learned that if you want to get your spouse the perfect present, you don't need to worry about the details because it'll come from the heart and you'll know what to get him/her. I thought the present Wilson got was perfectly thoughtful and romantic. All in all, it was good to read something different for a change. I would really love to see this turn into a movie though.Side note:I just opened my very own blog!
