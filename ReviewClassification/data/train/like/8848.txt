Running upwards of 1,700 poems, there's no conceivable way I could read them all. I settled for maybe half. That's not to say I'm not tempted to read them all, but Dickinson is one of those fine poets who begin to run a little stale after the first 200 or so poems. Best to step off and return to it later.Don't get me wrong, her innovative poetics is almost ghastly in its profundity, so much so that people use words like 'profundity' or say that she, who had no powers of prescience that her biographers are aware of, 'anticipated modernity', whatever that means. That means nothing. We don't need to place her. I think she was beyond that. Still is. Her poetry is almost drunken--staccato and broken and weird and refusing. In short, wonderful.
