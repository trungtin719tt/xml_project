I liked this series a great deal more than the Twilight books. It had all the action I was hoping for in the vampire books - and a little romance. It was an exciting read clear to the end of the 3rd book. No disappointments. I was frustrated with the relationship between Clary and Jace. Simon grew on me and he became a favorite by the end of The City of Glass.
