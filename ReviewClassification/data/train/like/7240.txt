I love Tennessee Williams and this is why. I had never read a play with such passion and lyricism (except for Shakespeare). I had read Death of a Salesman (of course, fantastic, but dry, like a worn book), Our Town (I wanted to fall out of my desk from sheer boredom), and Desire Under the Elms (I wanted to hang myself from the ridiculousness of this horrible play. Even seeing gorgeous Sophia Loren could not pull my opinion out of the mud) and they did nothing for my bad sixteen year old self. Then, I got a hold of this play and read it in one sitting. I know I picked it up for the Marlon Brando cover, but never expected such depth. The dialogue floored me, and the fact that Stanley is a terrible person and wins...who was this playwright? He opened up a whole new door for me, not just with plays, but with what is expected from characters.
