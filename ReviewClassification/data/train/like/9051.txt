Great book.Lots of laugh-out-loud fun.Best dialogue I've read in a very long time. Brilliant!Sexy vampires and a kick-ass heroine.Do I need to point out that the paranormal genre is NOT my favorite? It doesn't matter - this author's writing style and fantastic sense of humor sucked me right in.No need for me to write a review on this one since I am probably the last person on GR to finally read it, but I am posting a few of my favorite quotes ..."Lucifer's bouncing balls, Kitten, not again!"&lt;&lt;&lt; Still makes me laugh out loud!"Once you go dead, no ones better in bed"(Wouldn't that make a great song?)"One corpse, extra crispy! Do I hear a thousand dollars?""I am a nice young girl here to pick up your granddaughter for the weekend." ... "We're going to a Bible retreat to scare the devil out of her."(Bones to Cat's grandparents, page 173)AND"-and you don't care because you're all that and I'm just an artery in a dress."Also when Spade comes to visit and she wrestles him to the ground, when Bones shows up and deadpans ..."You'd better have a splendid explanation for her being on top of you." Reply: "I've never enjoyed a woman astride me less.AND FINALLYMy favorite quote actually comes from Timmie. After the whole "slay demons can I get an Amen" Timmie pokes his head back inside Cat's door and says,"I don't mind foreigners. God save the Queen!"Pure brilliance!Thank you Auntee and Shawna for the recommendation. =)
