It took me three attempts to get this one right. Something about the premise drew me in from the get go. I was destined to love this book. No way around it. I was in for an unpleasant surprise. It didn't take long before I found myself bored to tears. The language was so outmoded. Everything about it was plain difficult. I put it aside for a couple months in the hopes that it would get easier. It was still the same. I was still the same.A couple years passed. It was always in the back of my mind. In the end, curiosity and sheer stubbornness got the best of me. There was, to a lesser extent, a hopefulness about things. A hope that despite everything I disliked, there was something here that was worthwhile, that gave it value. So with this in mind, I read until I reached the end.There are some things that won't change. I don't love this style of poetry. Most of the letters between dead poets were eyebrow-raising at best and sleep-inducing at worst. None of that stood out to me. What did was the story. Towards the end, it become everything I'd wished for in perhaps the quietest way possible. Loose ends were tied off. The story was as rich as I always thought it would be. Down to the final sentence.I wouldn't recommend this to most people. It's a particular book for a particular person. This doesn't take away from it. Know yourself and what you like. I personally enjoyed this and I'm glad I gave it all the chances I did.
