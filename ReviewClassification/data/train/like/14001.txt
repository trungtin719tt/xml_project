A reread, a one that disappointed me a freaking lot. Once again. I really want to believe that humans are better than this. Or have been at some historical point. Then, bam!, and this arrives on my reading stack and proves to me that people have always been fucked up in their respective heads. Thanks a freaking lot! And here I was building my dreamcastle and getting ready to wear some rose glasses!This is not about a good marriage. This is about how some people can instigate each other to do weird shit (to put it extremely mildly!). Basically, if you take these two particular people going their separate ways, they might live well enough to not do too much damage to the world. But you connect them, in marriage or friendship or otherwise, and you get a boiling mix of complexes that even psychotherapy (had it even been available at that point in history, which it wasn't!) would have been hard pressed to resolve. The bottomline is: some people have synergistic effects when together, and some of those are designed by hell's blueprints.It's beautiful and all. But not everyone is likely to see all (or even most!) of the things expressed in this play. So, 4 stars. It's profound and I love the 'double trouble' thing (cheers, Mr. Potter!) but still way too somber.Q:Witch:When shall we three meet againIn thunder, lightning, or in rain?
