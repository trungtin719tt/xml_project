Totally a Nicholas Sparks formula, but I liked this one better than most. He at least waited until the couple knew each other for 3 weeks before hitting the sack together. It usually takes about 3 days, and happens immediately following their first kiss. I liked that they waited until they had kissed a few times, but really, can't he just hold off with the sex until they actually know each other? I'm still a Nicholas Sparks fan, though, because I am a woman, and I need my love stories. :)
