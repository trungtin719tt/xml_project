There was big news in the comics world this week when we learned that the reclusive Bill Watterson, author of the beloved Calvin and Hobbes cartoon who has been retired for almost 20 years, has been quietly collaborating on a new comic strip, Pearls Before Swine.Calvin and Hobbes ended in 1995, and for those who were born after that, I think it's hard to convey how much loss was felt when Watterson stopped drawing. I mean, I feltgenuine loss.I LOVED Calvin and Hobbes and I read it in the paper every day. (Kids, this was back when people actually read newspapers.) I stopped reading the comics page after Watterson retired -- nothing else compared to his brilliant and hilarious stories of a rambunctious boy and his imaginary pet tiger.A few years ago I was thrilled that someone had cataloged all of the Calvin and Hobbes cartoons into a database so you could search for keywords. Oh, what fun I had looking up old favorites! I own the complete collection of C&amp;H, and it is delightful to page through (I have so many fond memories of reading this comic that it's a trip back to my childhood), but if you are looking for a specific strip, it is hard to find in the books unless you know the date. But hooray for the internet search engine!If you have never read Calvin &amp; Hobbes, I highly recommend them to, well, everyone. Watterson's stories are clever and humorous and combine elements of philosophy, history, sociology, psychology, and the fun of being an energetic kid. Now if you'll excuse me, I need to finish my game of CalvinBall.
