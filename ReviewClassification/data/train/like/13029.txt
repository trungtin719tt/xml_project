I add this to my 'read' books having read it I don't know how many years ago (maybe even read it twice?), in Finnish translation. So what I write here is partly from memory, partly from having a look at my copy I recently bought.It's good post-apocalyptic scifi. The apocalypse being a nuclear war, a very likely threat around the time it was written (1959ish). A group of cloistered monks secretly nourishing knowledge of past and trying to help some survivors. From this the humanity slowly patches itself up and begins to redevelop - but can they stay away from past mistakes (and another nuclear war)?...(view spoiler)[ Nope. The cover art of my book kind of gives it away. But hope, and a desire to try again, survives, even as the last monk dusts off his sandals before closing the spaceship door. And that makes this(hide spoiler)]a great read. Even if you don't really care for Christianity, you can still admire how a group of people can preserve the knowledge and repair, again and again.Guess I really do need to read this again, because I just convinced myself to do so *lol* *cough* I will put it on my 'to re-read' list. It will be interesting to see how it reads in English :)
