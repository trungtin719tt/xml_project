This is a life changing work by a life changing author. Musil inspires without trying to inspire, is wise without preaching. In the mold of Aurelius, disguised as a novel, most of those hundreds of pages are quotable. Reminds me of Dostoevsky very much, but their styles are very different.It is easy to see why his work was quickly forgotten after his death. A world races madly towards consumerism and self gratification, in the name of all sorts of ideologies, will not understand and genuinely appreciate Musil.On reading, Musil has this to say:"Hardly anyone still reads nowadays. People make use of the writer only in order to work off their own excess energy on him in a perverse manner, in the form of agreement or disagreement."Anyone who could provide such an insight is worth re-reading many times over.
