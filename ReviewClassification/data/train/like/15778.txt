Our Journey..."To travel is very useful, it makes the imagination work, the rest is just delusion and pain. Our journey is entirely imaginary, which is its strength."Celine's first novel begins with the words,"Here's how it started"and finishes"...and that would be the end of us."In between is a journey that takes in childhood, family life, service in the great war, recuperation in a hospital, an adventure in the heart of darkness of colonial Africa, a liberating voyage across the Atlantic, the glamorous promise of New York, factory work in Detroit, a return to Paris, life as a doctor in semi-rural France, a job in an insane asylum, and eventually death. It's an entire kaleidoscope of life experience....To the End of the NightWhat's implied by the end of the night? That we've endured the darkness of the night, and now another day has started? Or is life just one day that ends with the night? Is life a metaphorical journey consisting of only one day and night?It's possible that life is a period that consists of both light and darkness, that it's a blend of both happiness and sadness, and that the end of the night is the death that comes at the end of our lives:"A time comes when you're all alone, when you've come to the end of everything that can happen to you. It's the end of the world...The truth is death."Ultimately, however much we connect with family or society, we must confront death individually.Madelon and the PicaroThe clearest insight into the narrator, Ferdinand, comes from Madelon:"First you cuckold your friends, then you beat their women!"They are polar opposites, almost rivals for the love or affection of Leon Robinson.Whatever ostensible pride Ferdinand might have, Madelon is"clean and beautiful",somebody who makes a point of"fidelity and respectability."She attacks his deluded self-esteem, his arrogance, his narcissism. He responds by slapping her face, twice,"hard enough to stun a mule".Both of them encounter light and darkness. Both experience loss and grief.Ferdinand is a picaro. The novel is as picaresque as anything by Cervantes, Rabelais, Sterne and Swift, except it's set squarely at the cusp of both modernism and modernity. At times, it seems like a precursor to Saul Bellow's more upbeat and upwardly mobile"The Adventures of Augie March".Yet Ferdinand is more old world plebeian than new world noble Augie. In his eyes, the promise of an American-style dream is a cinematic illusion. It turns humans into machines in the name of both production and consumption.A Lecherous ExistenceIf there's one word associated with this novel, it's misanthropy. However, Ferdinand doesn't so much hate the rest of mankind as float along in life, trying to make"practical headway in the course of my harassed existence".The concern of this man is his own existence. The other players are bit parts.As Robinson says to Madelon,"Ferdinand isn't a bad sort, but delicacy isn't his strong point...nor fidelity either!"He derives the greatest love and pleasure from the American, Molly, and"her long, blond, magnificently strong, lithe legs, noble legs. Say what you like, the mark of true aristocracy in humankind is the legs."In other words, he's a pretty typical, lecherous, single guy, an"anxious, frustrated man",occasionally appreciative of"a blonde with unforgettable tits and shoulders",driven by the desire that resides in his testicles, and a quest for amusement and happiness, provided it doesn't come at too great a cost:"Like it or not, a day should be one long almost unbearable pleasure, one long coitus...Happiness on earth would be to die with and while having pleasure."Could life, after all, be one long coitus, and then you die?Beyond MisanthropyI started reading the novel, expecting to be repulsed by its misanthropy. Initially, I was surprised by its fluency, the way the narrative progressed almost organically like life itself, then I succumbed to the exuberance of its story telling, its unexpected sense of humour, its black comedy, even if"all the rest is shit and misery."Eventually, it seemed that, but for the violence against Madelon, it wasn't as misanthropic as its reputation would have it. Thus, for me, it was a far more enjoyable reading experience than I had anticipated. Don't be deterred by anything you've read or heard (including this review). This is a genuine classic! Pessimistic, cynical, perhaps, but still marvellously entertaining.
