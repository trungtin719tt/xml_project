It's a little difficult to put into words how this book made me feel. It's a short book so I thought I'd fly through it in a day or two. Instead, it took a couple of weeks to finish. It was not because I was overly busy or because my mind was drifting or that I was distracted by...ooh! shiny! It was mainly because Steinbeck put so many layers upon layers of depth and feeling into each of his superbly crafted sentences that I could have made baklava with them.I found this story extremely timely considering today's economy and the fall of the financial industry (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, etc.). Perhaps in financial downturns, the world always seems the same. Other than the fact Ethan Allen Hawley didn't own a car or a tv, I would be hard pressed to not place him in a more contemporary setting. But this is not about the economy or people down-on-their-luck like you had inThe Grapes of Wrath. This story was much more ordinary, every day, common. And the people populating this story were oh-so-ordinary, every day, common. They could be your aunt or cousin or next-door neighbor. They could be you or at least your parents. And I think that is where Steinbeck excels so excellently. He makes fictional characters sorealyou swear you know this story already because you know these people.Temptation. Honor. Survival. Luck. Family. Progress. Faith. This story has it all.I cannot recommend it enough.
