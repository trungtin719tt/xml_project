Book Review4 of 5 stars toGreen Eggs and Ham, a picture book written byDr. Seussin 1960. Another delightful children's book full of wonderful images and fantastic rhymes. These are amazing books to use as tools that engages young kids in reading at a very early age. The topic in this one... Sam-I-Am and all the places to eat green eggs and ham! On some levels, the things they eat and the places they go are not appropriate for kids, but it's meant as humor and fun... so I let those things go. Another book to read with a child... not hand off and hope (s)he figures it out. And Dr. Seuss has a world of characters children love and want to hear and see all the time. I'd definitely recommend this one as a starter book for your kids... even with some of the items to be careful over, when it comes to being funny versus truthful... and not giving off incorrect perceptions:I loved it as a childAnd I simply love it nowBut don't get too crazy or wildNor caught up in the howEnjoy our famous friendThe wonderful Dr. SeussHe likes to our ears just bendA fun and dandy ruseAbout MeFor those new to me or my reviews... here's the scoop: I read A LOT.
