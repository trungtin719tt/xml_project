Mac Version 3.0I start this book expecting little sweet Barbie Mac.......and this happens.Someone starts mailing Mac pages from her sister's Alina's journal and that start making her think. Then the two main guys that have been playing her still won't answer any questions. They seem to want to just use her for their own purposes.Well, Mac starts getting tired of it.She starts to realize that she is all she has on her side. She must not rely on a man to come save her! Hells yeah. She starts using them for more of what she needs to find her way in the fae over run world that she is stuck in.I think the first two books were fun for me..NOW I'VE BECOME A FANATIC!!There were times when I probably would have thrown my panties at V'lane and Barrons..but then there were times I'd have smacked the shit out of them.Then there is that frigging cliffhanger of an ending!! I'm only getting one of these books a month! I don't know if I can wait!
