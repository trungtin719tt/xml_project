this is a great book. If you like the lord of the rings movies and books you should read this. its the prequel to the story. Its all about how he got the ring and how it all started. tons of fighting and action but also at times calm. As you can tell from the title its about the hobbits but it also has the elves, dwarfs, and many other creatures. There is also a dragon and you get to meet gollum, the weird little creature that alway says "my precious", who at a time was also a hobbit untill he was cursed by the ring. this story tell of bilbo baggins adventure with the dwarfs and the all powerfull gandalf the grey. its a fast story with lots of surprises on every page. If you havnt read the lord of the rings yet i think you should the books are a lot better then the movie. Now if you have read the lord of the rings but didnt think to read the prequel, i think you sould. This is one of my favorite book the i would be happy to read again.
