I'm worried that most people will misunderstand the intelligence behind this book. I have met a few people who have said, "that book? I read that in high school." My response is "did you understand this book in high school?"Am I wrong in saying that first, one should read Kafka; second, one should understand how Kafka's fiction functions as a blend of anthropology, theology, and philosophy, among other things. Then, read Phillip K. Dick again, and notice the themes of paranoia, identity crisis, and near-psychotic breakdown while doing one's business in "normal" society. With _Do Andriods Dream..._ consider that PK Dick is writing in 1968, and that his invention of scheduled moods and Mercerism (a kind of Sisyphisean religion and internet-religion) has more sociological commentary than most so-called literary fiction today. Le Guin is right: PK Dick is an American Borges. At least someone read this book after high school.
