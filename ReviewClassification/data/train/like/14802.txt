What can I say? This novel was right up my alley.It revolves around a family and their lives in all their complexity and their amazing simplicity, set in a Welsh coal mining village (which was a unusual setting for me). It was wonderfully written, at once intimate, profound and simple. I loved that it detailed a way of life, harsh, but simple in a way, that is now lost for the most part.The story is narrated by Huw Morgan, and he has a unique, candid, wise and totally human voice. The parents were also wonderful figures in the novel.A must-read.
