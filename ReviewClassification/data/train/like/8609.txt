I've pondered long and hard over this review and the rating. To be honest, it seemed a little short and a little sparse on storyline and(view spoiler)[ the last battle, was hardly a battle.(hide spoiler)]That said on reflection it was still a good read, we met a few great new characters Puzzle; Poggin; Jewel and Farsight, as well as King Tirian, and we did get to(view spoiler)[ reemit some of the previous visitors to Narnia and their Narnia friends later in the story; the appearance of Reepicheep brought a tear to my eye(hide spoiler)].So all in all I feel justified in giving it 4 stars in line with its fellow Narnia chronicles.I cannot believe I have now read all 7, and whilst I realise they are meant for children younger than me ("lol") I really enjoyed them and as with all great series', I wish there were more to read.I know some people have accused C.S. Lewis of being racist (duh !), and of the books having too many religious overtones (or undertones) but in my view they are good stories that have a message that all humans should agree with, that of understanding, respect, tolerance and above all love for one's fellow man.
