This novel is a masterpiece.It's tempting to compare it to other works so as to characterize it but to do so would be a disservice.Prof. Harkness writes well and her story-telling is engaging and suspenseful. She masterfully weaves together history, science, alchemy, illuminated manuscripts, love, sex, war, and family dynamics.You'll enjoy this novel and then you'll be eager for the sequel.Highly recommended.SR.
