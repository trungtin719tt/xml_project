This has been my favorite so far of the series. So much happens and theres a big change with Nora and she seems so much more like-able. I loved the twists in this one and how every book has that great "Veronica Mars" feel to it. I will definitely be finishing this series!Nora wakes up to find out she's been kidnapped the last three months but it has left her with amnesia that goes back five months. Her mom and best friend Vee are there for her trying to fill in the blanks but she can't help but feel something is missing. When the truth pours out little by little she realizes she isn't the person she thought she was. Will she like the person she has become?
