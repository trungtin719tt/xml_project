I think I read this book about when I was 9. It was summer and it was on my parents shelf so I picked it up to read. I LOVED IT! Even at such a young age. I remember it took me a while to finish but it was compelling, so I kept reading (it's 900 pgs). I think reading the vivid imagery of the slave trade and their treatment was one thing that helped me develop a lot of compassion -- I CARE so much (ok probably too much) about those who've been wronged. And WOW did it open my eyes!! After reading this I went on a black history kick where I almost read everything I could about MLK Jr &amp; Malcolm X. Interesting stage for a 10-year-old suburban white girl in Idaho to go through :-). Anyway, read it -- because it's better than the miniseries. And because of the whole family connection/ancestry thing, too.
