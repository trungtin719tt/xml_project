5++stars!!! Absolutely mesmerized by this book on audio!!!!! Definitely want to thank KAS for putting up a review of this book or it would have gone long forgotten by me! Originally written in 1979 - is that correct??? WOW, and carries a 4.24 avg rating - well that says something!!!I had my eye on this book back in the late 90's, back when I read more of this type of fiction. I can't believe 20 years later I am finally picking it up!! Lately I just don't seem to find an interest in these longer saga type novels - but this one had me from the first moment!!The writing is SO vivid, and the story was SO gripping. There are so many subtle twists and turns to the plot. Yet, the story was simply about human emotions. Greed, poverty, love, hate, stubbornness, entitlement - you know all those powerful feelings dating back to Adam and Eve and their children. The characters in this book were so enjoyable - I just loved every moment!!! I lived in William's banks and Abel's hotels - I traveled the world with the story!! I listened to this on audio - definitely an awesome job by the narrator! Highly recommend!!!!
