I actually never thought I'd be writing a review and typing out the sentence, "this book changed my life." But I can't really get around it. It feels dramatic and sweeping and ridiculous, but this book really changed my life. It was also a matter of good timing, and I was also given some thoughts from watching "The Wind Rises" at the same time as I was reading.Joseph Campbell speaks about his knowledge as if it is unequivocal, unarguable truth. I was charmed and yet annoyed. I was firmly rooted in the belief that there is a different interpretation to everything. "There are no absolutes" is actually my life motto. And then I had a realization after I had finished reading the book. I was thinking about "The Wind Rises," concepts that Joseph Campbell had talked about, and then applying these things to my life. And then I too realized that there were things I knew to be the inarguable truth.I don't wanna get dramatic in a Goodreads review. I just want to give you a little bit of the feeling I got from this book. Campbell is passionate, persuasive, and an intelligent thinker as well as someone who has really done his research. I think that every human being who has ever lived should read this book.
