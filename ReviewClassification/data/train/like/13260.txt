Okay, okay, okay. Four stars.See, I enjoy these books while reading them, and its not until afterwards that I realize their faults. I get sucked into the easy writing and run-and-hide plot. Its certainly a good way to spend a few hours.This series could have been one book, because really, the plot of these books is pretty much running, hiding, moments of sexual tension, and the occasional revelation. Take a cheese grater to this series, and you might just have one excellent YA paranormal.If you asked me to pick out one standout moment in this book, I couldn't tell ya. Everything just kind of blurs...So, although this book is plenty repetitive, it still gets four stars. I had a fun time reading it, and as far as YA paranormals go, it could have been worse. There is nothing offensive about it, as far as I can tell, and the characters act like teenagers, albeit wholesome ones.Four stars. And that goes for the entire series, not just for this particular book.
