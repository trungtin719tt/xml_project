Holy shit (literally). This book is riveting. It is a fictional novel based on the life of a guy named Jesus who is one badass motherfucker. The book chronicles some of his totally rad and awesome adventures, such as turning water into wine and coming out of a cave after he died! Any lover of fictional adventure books such as harry potter will love this book. It does have some slower parts, but it picks right back up every couple of chapters (the chapters are creatively named after people!). Also, I learned a lot from this book. It had some good messages, such as how killing and being gay are wrong! Happy reading!
