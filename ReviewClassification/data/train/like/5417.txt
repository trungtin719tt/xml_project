$1.99 Kindle sale, July 23, 2017. One of my very favorite old Golden Age SF novels. The old empire is dying, says one Hari Selden, a brilliant historian and statistician, even though hardly anyone believes him. Can he and his followers use their knowledge of history and human behavior to build a better galactic society when the current empire collapses? A quick and absorbing read that's great fun.I cut my science fiction-lovin' teeth on this trilogy. Asimov was brilliant.Read count: I dunno, 4 or 5 times?
