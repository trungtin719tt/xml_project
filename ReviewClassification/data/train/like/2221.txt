this book rocked my world, and i've been trying for weeks to understand why. here it is:* because the plot is flawless* because the voice is flawless* because it's amazingly tender without being cute* because there's a christopher boone in me, and a christopher boone in everyone i love or at least try to get along with* because the christopher boone in me loves to see itself written about lovingly, like it's the coolest kid, if not on the block (it will never be the coolest kid on the block), at least in the annals of literature* because the christopher boone in those i love or at least try to get along with is telling me, "be patient; please, be patient; i'm doing the best i can"* because i understand this plea, since it's a plea i issue myself like 230 times a day
