Excellent children's book. I wish adults would read this one too and remember the message - how candid God's love is toward us. On our personal journey, we are often labeled and framed according to our performance which is measured by human standards. God does not see us in labels, frames, or colors, and does not love us according to our performance. He made us, He did not make a mistake, and loves us as we are because we belong to Him. Once these words become revelation in us, everything changes and what others think about us matters very little because what is important is that in the greater scheme of things, we are beautiful in our Creator's eyes.
