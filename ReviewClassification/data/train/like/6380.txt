In my opinion GO ASK ALICE is a very realistic book. Because it was written and published in 1971 you have to forgive the book being a generation behing in coolness, if you will. However, coolness is not what GO ASK ALICE is about. This diary style written book is a story of a 15 year old girl who goes through the trials and tribulations of the basic teenager who throughout the book remain anonymous. Anon finds her diary to be her only friend and confides in it for almost 2 years. During this time she goes through truly horrific experiences.There are a total of two diaries total and the end of the book is completely left unexplained. I wish that would have been more clear. Obviously, if this really is based on a true diary and Anon decided not to continue to write anymore, we would not know but I don't believe that Anon had a relapse. I just wish there would have been some more of the diary.I hope that the kids in this generation won't let the verbage in GO ASK ALICE turn them off to reading this book because it's very informal and should really be read in it's entirety. I have read reviews that a lot of kids quit the book or that it's fake, etc.This is for those people:1. Read the book completely and we'll talk.2. Have you been there? Yes, I mean right up in the middle of an acid trip. Good or bad. Smoked a doobie? Snorted a line? Shot up some heroin? Candy-flipped? Ate a handful of shrooms?3. Don't judge or talk about things unless you REALLY know what you're talking about.
