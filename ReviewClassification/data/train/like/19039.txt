I loved going away to college with Anne. Her life there with her friends at Patty's Place just exudes charm and cozy-feelings. Of course, I was thrilled with the happily-ever-after, while completely relating to Anne's nostalgia about days gone by. I think Anne, and myself, needed the reminder that even when it's sad to leave the former things behind, there are always good things to come. Anne is such an indescribably charismatic character, one that is sincere and lovely to be around. The secondary characters are always so fun - my favorites in this one are Phillipa and Aunt Jimsie - they just made me smile. I'm so eager to read the next installment in the series.
