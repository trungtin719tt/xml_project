I first read this book 30 years ago, and I this week I listened to it in the car on a long road trip. These books are amazing and so funny. I spent half the drive going down the road laughing out loud in my car (and sometimes even tearing up a bit).When I was a child I was sure I wanted to be a veterinarian. I think these books probably made a huge contribution that. I never did become a vet, but I still love the books.
