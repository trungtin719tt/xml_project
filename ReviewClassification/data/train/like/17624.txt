What to say about this devastating masterpiece? It's the 2nd time I've read it, and while it was hard to read the 1st time, I think re-reading is perhaps worse, because I knew the horrible thing that was coming (incest/rape). I don't really know how Ann-Marie MacDonald writes beautifully about such dark things, telling the intergenerational story of this fucked up family. The voice actor does an incredible job with the audiobook. If you can stomach it, this is a masterpiece, as I said. But fuck is it ever dark.Full review / personal essay onmy blog!
