Oh my... how I fell in love with this classic novel, I adored the main protagonist and felt she was fully developed as a character. Her constant ruminations and daydreams really set the tone it's a real trip getting to be inside her head with all her naive neurotic thoughts, which often get carried away and make for a compelling read.It follows the main (unnamed) character when she moves to Manderley with her new husband, from the beginning she is aware that she lives in the shadow of the former mistress of Manderley...Rebecca. Although Rebecca is dead it appears that her shadow is everywhere, her haunting presence becomes a nightmare for the new Mrs de Winter. The plot thickens and there is a little twist added. Oh and how I loved the wonderful vivid descriptions of Manderley, the dark gloomy gothic setting, it's all wonderfully evocative and the slow sinister mood that creeps in is just delicious. The ending also for me was spot on. I'm so glad I finally got around to reading this book and know why it's considered such a classic! 5 fun creepy stars!!
