Second Reading: Just as amazing as I remembered (:**********First Reading:Tonight is opening night for my school's extracurricular performance of this wonderful play. I've read it probably a minimum of 20 times over these past 10 weeks and just fell in love with this entire story. I adore all my cast mates and just can't get over how excited I am to perform this! And I cannot be grateful enough to be playing such a strong, powerful, wicked character like Regan. She was so fun to get to know and I hope I do her justice. (: Alright, let's do this :D
