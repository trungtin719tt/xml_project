Liberates the woman Mary Magdalene, gives her the history, wisdom, and power we wish she might have had. I delighted in the rich and beautiful esoteric presentation of Christ and his teachings. This is a love story on several levels; there is the love of wisdom (present in the philosophy woven throughout the entire book), the love held especially for a man (in its most devoted form), and love for the divine (in essence, the purest love of all.)I've reread this twice and will read it again. I don't hesitate to say this may be one of my most favorite stories.Definately worth the read.
