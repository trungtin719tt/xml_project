One of the worlds best selling books of all time, Agatha Christie's "and Then There Were None" sets the standard for crime fiction.The book was first published under a different title in jolly old England, but even back in 1939 American publishers were far too politically correct to use a title they found so offensive.Still again, in 1964 and again in 1986 a third title was published but political correctness struck again. I read the book under the authors original title because I wanted to read it as she intended it.The book has inspired radio broadcast, stage adaptations, television mini series, several movies, board and video games.As the 1939 story begins, 8 unacquainted guest have been invited to a very large home on an isolated island off the coast of England for a type of holiday. When the water ferry drops them off they find their host has not yet arrived but there are two staff members there to meet their needs. Soon it is brought to their attention that all 8 guest along with the 2 staff members are accused of various murders from their past. Then the first of the guest drops dead. By the next morning another of the remaining 9 is found dead. There is surely a murderer on the island and as the story continues to unfold the reader is never given any information other than that which the guest may encounter.I didn't figure out who done it. I do know that I didn't do it.But you fellow reader ... the way you so innocently stopped to read this review. Perchance to see if any incriminating evidence has been uncovered..Very suspicious, I say.
