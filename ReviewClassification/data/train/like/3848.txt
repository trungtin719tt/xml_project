I can't believe that I am experiencing this book for the first time as an adult. I loved The Secret Garden as a child (and continue to as an adult) but didn't know this story or the movie adaptation(s). I enjoyed this story but it felt like a very close storyline to The Secret Garden (little girl out of India being orphaned and using their imagination to make life bearable) but it didn't live up to my love of The Secret Garden.It was sweet, it had a great message, but it didn't blow me away. Still, I have a beautiful edition that I will happily keep on my shelves.
