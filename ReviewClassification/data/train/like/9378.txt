The only reason I really liked this book is because we finally find out about Acheron's backstory. The first part: great. The second: one big struggle. Some things felt so weird and OOC.I get it, he deserves some happiness, but he is different from the rest. Some of the things he did/said annoyed me and that has never happened before. He lost about half his fierceness, which is a very sad thing. Gone is the man that made my body tingle whenever his name was mentioned.ETA: I re-read this book and I didn't change my mind, sadly.Ash you are one hot SOB but damn, I want to slap you.
