For a kid's story, this one has rather heavy-handed intentions embedded into quite a sophisticated system of symbols that exists to produce a strong &amp; emotional effect. Like Voltaire in "Micromegas", Antoine de Saint-Exupery plays with sizes &amp; scales, meddles with the allegorical and even plays with time. He knew, like an astute psychoanalyst, precisely which images to use to convey the mere representation of Mortality. Le Petit Prince is the Everyman who has a deep passion somewhere inside of him and only with childlike wonder and awe (he asks questions on top of questions: no matter the degree of absurdity) is he able to show us glimpses of it. Externalizing feelings like only a child can. I find the golden-tressed titular child a very peculiar emblem in the middle of the Saharan desert... an eerie, living monolith (almost an oxymoron when one comes to think of it.) So, kids, let me ask you this one: Are we just placed on this planet so as to remain forever... ALONE?
