I've never been to San Francisco. But now I feel like I've made a thorough visit to early Twentieth Century San Francisco. In this wonderfully diverting story, I fell headlong into the plot and the setting. It was all a strange and exciting adventure for me in a whole world I never knew existed. What fun.
