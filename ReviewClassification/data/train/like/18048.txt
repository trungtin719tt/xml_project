"What more shall I say: born under light bulbs, deliberately stopped growing at age of three, given drum, sang glass to pieces, smelled vanilla, coughed in churches, observed ants, decided to grow, buried drum, emigrated to the West, lost the East, learned stonecutter's trade, worked as model, started drumming again, visited concrete, made money, kept finger, gave finger away, fled laughing, rode up escalator, arrested, convicted, sent to mental hospital, soon to be acquitted, celebrating this day my thirtieth birthday and still afraid of the Black Witch."Oskar is a little monster. He stopped growing, break glass with his voice and annoy people with his tin drum. But Oskar won a Nobel. For what? How can a midget who can barely talk win this prize?But he did it. For showing us this world from another perspective. Showing us WW2 - and war in general- from another perspective. He wasn't the English soldier who sees the horrors of war. He wasn't the German soldier who feels sorry for what he did. He wasn't the jew. He wasn't the journalist who show us the real face of war.No.He was looking at those stupid adults from down to up but in the same time from up to down. They believe in Santa Claus, Santa Gas, Jesus, Hitler and Virgin Mary. He believe in his drum, in Goethe, in Rasputin and in Maria. His Maria. He care about holocaust only when the toy store owner is killed. And he can't get drums anymore. He listen Nazi new conquests for learning geography. He's a little prick and he don't show sympathy for anyone. In his surreal story, nobody escapes from his bitter direct irony. Except his grandmother.You will hate him. And If you will hate him enough, maybe you will start to love him also.
