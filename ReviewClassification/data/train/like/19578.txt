author : Hans Anderson. How have I never heard this name before. How is it even possible. This man has created the most poignant of my childhood stories and I have come to know about him so late in my life. Well, at least it was not unlike the other learning of my life : always late but you will get there, trust me!The tales are familiar because they have been adopted in all possible media since decades. Thumbelina, The Princess and the Pea, The king's new Clothes, The Mermaid were beyond fun. It was like going on that roller coaster ride when you know you will end up all nauseous and wobbly but still you so damn enjoy the process leading up to it that you are game for everything.Some tales in the end seem a little lacking but I believe it was mainly because of the mountain high expectation I had from them due to the sky-high bars set from the tales leading up to them. Nonetheless the journey was immensely fun and intriguing. Each time I was hooked to the tale at hand and at the same time was also wondering about the magic the next tale may bring on the table. Crazy? Indeed it is.I am thinking about adding a book shelve here for the books "which make me feel glad that I spend half of my months spending on books" and this is sure to be on the top of it. I can't add it because the name is too big. :(PG.
