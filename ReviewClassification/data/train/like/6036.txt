Oh I do so love Sherlock. I have read this book a few times over the years (god, I sound ancient ha ha), but I never tire of it. I have also seen (and own) any number of movie/TV versions of this story and they all bring something to the story in their different ways.It is a wonderful story featuring a "fictional" character that surely half the world knows. As G K Chesterton put it, (most) other detective stories are judged on the intricacies of the story line and the characters are secondary, Conan Doyle excelled at his characterisations, creating a truly amazing central character that is not secondary to the stories but intrinsically linked with them.As with a Miss Marple last month, it makes me want to read more Sherlocks, how on earth am I going to fit it all in this year ??
