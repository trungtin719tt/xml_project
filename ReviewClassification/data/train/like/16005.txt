WARNING: THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR EVERYONE....With that said, I put this book as one of my favorites. When I finished my feelings were all over the place, that I needed time to collect them. Now its been months and this book still makes my heart beat faster, my palms get sweaty, and I am eager to see where "A" will be next. You see this is a tale like no other. David Levithan has messed with my head, in a way that I am grateful for. He made me think and choose between ideas and feelings I never thought I would want to choose from.I don't know how this works. Or why. I stopped trying to figure it out a long time ago. I'm never going to figure it out, any more than a normal person will figure out his or her own existence. After a while, you have to be at peace with the fact you simplyare.There is no way to know why. You can have theories, but there will never be proof.This is a question that "A" never really had to think about, he was whatever he would be for that day. Never really needed to know in way, because he could be a drug addict, high school jock, or a shy young girl.For everyday is a new day for him. Everyday day is a mystery. Everyday is a new place. Everyday is a new home. Everyday is new views. Everyday is a new body. Everyday is new mind. And everyday "A" just goes through motions. Never really attaching to his host, just tapping enough to get through the day. Day after day, this was his life.Then he wakes up in Justin's body. Justin is not special, he is a grungy self centered adolescent teenager. But todays he's "A", and today "A's" life will be forever changed. For today "A" meets Justin's girlfriend Rhiannon. Most days Justin treats Rhiannon like crap, but today "A" is Justin and as much he tries to stick to the plan, he can't. All it took was one day, one person to make him think to want more for himself. For the first time in his 16 years of existence he questions everything. Why is he like this? Is there more like him? is he really a she? More importantly how to stay connected to the one you love when your someone different everyday, and how does she fall in love with you? How does she meet you and not the body you are currently? Like I said, this book is very unconventional and very forward thinking. You might not be able to see past "A's" exterior to see him, but if you read openly I promise you that you will. Forget how, what , where, or who... it's the only way to allow your brain to be able to absorb the beauty that is this book. After you still might go back to your same beliefs and thats ok. But I promise it will be a book you will never forget, because "A" will leave his mark on you.I am the walrus. I'm nobody-who are you? Let all the dreamers wake the nation...Before we say goodbye, she kissed me with everything she has. And I try to kiss her back with everything I want. This is the nice note, I can't help thinking. But just like a sound, as soon as the note hits the air, it begins to fade.
