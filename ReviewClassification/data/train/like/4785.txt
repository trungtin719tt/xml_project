This was a masterful yarn about a complex relationship between mother and daughter. It was about the loss of self, the journey of finding oneself, and most importantly - the resilience of the human spirit. This wasn't a tale of any ordinary bond between mother and daughter, this was a story of the severe dysfunction that occurs when a mother, Ingrid, is imprisoned for murder and a daughter, Astrid, is passed around like garbage from one foster home to another. This novel explores the intricacies of their relationship. It explores the depth of emotion that Astrid feels toward Ingrid, ranging from obsessive love to all-encompassing hatred.Janet Fitchis not just a storyteller. She is like Calliope, the Greek Muse of epic poetry. Fitch spins letters into gold; every word that she chooses is deliberate and precise. When you read a book by Fitch it is an experience to savor; letting the story wash over your soul in warm, gentle waves. Once complete, you will feel emotionally exhausted, yet wholly renewed. I urge you to experience this book in all of its glory; it is notjusta book. It is every child that has been mistreated in a foster home. It is their voice. It is their tears.It is hope.
