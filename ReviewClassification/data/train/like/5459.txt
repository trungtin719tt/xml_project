It is so important to have peace of mind, in order to remain in one piece...Wishing you all warmth, peace and fulfillment. You need to read Walden at least once.Thoreau's words:"Direct your eye right inward, andyou'll findA thousand regions in your mindYet undiscovered. Travel them,and beExpert in home-cosmography.""They love the soil which makes their graves, but have no sympathy with the spirit which may still animate their clay.""It is remarkable how easily and insensibly we fall into a particular route, and make a beaten track for ourselves.""A living dog is better than a dead lion. Shall a man go and hang himself because he belongs to the race of the pygmies, and not be the biggest pygmy that he can? Let every one mind his own business, and endeavor to be what he was made.""However mean your life is, meet it and live it; do not shun it and call it hard names. It is not so bad as you are. It looks poorest when you are richest.""Humility like darkness reveals the heavenly lights.""Rather than love, than money, than fame, give me truth.""The light which puts out our eyes is darkness to us. Only that day dawns to which we are awake. There is more day to dawn. The sun is but a morning star."
