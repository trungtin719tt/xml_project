My relationship with Nicholas Sparks began withThe Notebook, the movie. I LOVE that movie. It's one of the few movies I can watch over and over. I was so infatuated with the story (I wanted to be Allie and where was my Noah and plantation house?!!) and when I found out there was a novel behind it, I searched it out and picked it up; It was love at first page. From there, I've been picking up his books and waiting for his new releases.Nicholas Sparks has a craft of bringing his characters to life. He doesn't just paint a story; he brings it to life. His character development is superb. He pays attention to detail, not so much that it's overload, but enough to allow you to be there.My only complaint with this book, and many of his other books, is the book cover. There is no wow(!) factor; It doesn't draw me in.The title (as with most of his books) has a double-meaning; not only is there a rescue in the beginning of the book, there's a more important rescue that takes place towards the end. Nicholas Sparks picks the perfect title for his books, making you wonder what it really means because he's not referring to the obvious.As with most Nicholas Sparks books, have the tissues ready. You won't find lots of sex in this book. Nicholas Sparks is a romantic-sizer, not a sex hound.Review originally posted onThe Book Vixen.
