I read this book a thousand times to the little girl I was a nanny for this summer. It is the perfect book to read right before a nap because I found my voice would naturally get softer while I flipped the pages.It's true the colours are a bit garish and it drives me absolutely bonkers that she writes "goodnight moon" and then follows with "goodnight cow jumping over the moon." I tried every which way to make the rhythm work but it just doesn't no matter what you do. But what the heck does a 15 month-old care?I find it strange that people are put off by saying goodnight to inanimate objects but babies LOVE DOING THAT. If the baby was upset because we were leaving the park, I would just start saying goodbye to the slide, goodbye to the swings and she would start waving with me and then she felt better about walking away. It's a really good trick!Ultimately it's a classic and it ends in a very quiet, sleepy way that is perfect for bedtime.
