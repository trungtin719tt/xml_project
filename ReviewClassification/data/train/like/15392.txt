Note, Jan. 18, 2017: I edited this review just now to correct a typo.I've read the Bible multiple times, and intend to keep on reading it for the rest of my life. I know it to be God's communication to humanity, written by men under the guidance of His Spirit, and revealing His nature, His love, His plans for the universe and for our salvation, and the principles by which we should live. It's a bedrock foundation of truth on which to build our lives.
