I first read Imagica when I was in high school. Expecting horror (in the 90's, anything Clive Barker was automatically lumped in the Horror section) I was treated to a brilliantly imaginative portal fantasy that spanned 5 worlds, or dominions, as the books calls them. The book left a profound impression on me and opened the door to reading everything else Barker had published. So after 20 years I decided to revisit Imagica and see how I thought of it with older eyes (or ears, since I selected the Audible edition for my reread).Imagica has held up very well. Many parts I had forgotten over the years, so I was treated to some surprises, but what I did remember detracted from the wow factor that I remembered from my youth. Brilliantly imaginative and with excellent prose, Imagica explores history, religion, sexuality, love, and identity. It's a bit of a slow start. The book begins with an estranged husband hiring an assassin to murder his wife, then changing his mind, sending his wife's former lover to stop the assassin. While interesting, the book has almost no fantastical elements for the fist 120 pages. Then when it comes...BAM.I really enjoyed my reread. While today I might rate it a 4, I'm going to keep the 5-star I originally rated it. This is partly because I do not know how I would have rated it had I not read it before, and partly due to the significant impact the novel had on me when I was 16.
