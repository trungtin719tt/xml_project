**It should be mentioned that this audio version is a retelling of Corrie Ten Boom's memoir, for a modern day audience.Fantastic! Inspirational. I listened to this on audio book in one sitting....I was mesmerised, I couldn't tear myself away from it...I didn't want to.What an amazing story, what amazing courageous women, Corrie Ten Boom shows how faith can carry you through all manner of terrible trials.Corrie Ten Boom tells her beautiful life story which includes her family giving shelter to Jewish people during the occupation of Holland in WW2. Then, as a consequence after being caught, her time spent in a German concentration camp with her elder sister Betsie, and how, through their undying faith, they coped and survived together until Betsie became ill and Corrie had to cope without her. The two sisters had always been inseparable which made her loss all the more keenly felt.I highly recommend this book to all readers.Very well deserved 5*s I will definately be reading more from this inspirational lady.
