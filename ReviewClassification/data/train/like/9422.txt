Everyday Wemmicks go around sticking stickers on the other Wemmicks. If you are smart, pretty, or talented, they will place a star on your wooden frame. But if you are not star-worthy then they will place a grey dot instead. Punchinello is one such Wemmick, no matter how hard he tries, he just keeps getting more and more gray dots. It takes a chance meeting with a Wemmick that has no stickers whatsoever that finally sets Punchinello in the right direction.This was a lovely story that perfectly illustrated how God sees us and how we let the world bog us down with their ideas of perfection. I really liked this book and recommend this to any child who has ever felt as if they don't have anything to offer.*Taken from my book reviews blog:http://reviewsatmse.blogspot.com/2008...
