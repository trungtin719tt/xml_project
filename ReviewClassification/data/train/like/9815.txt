Where do I start...This book had me from the very moment I started reading. I just knew it would be something out of the ordinary.17-year old Aislinn (how to pronounce that name?), or "Ash", is not like other girls. She can see fairies. And not good fairies, fairies that fight and do all kinds of bad stuff. She's learned how to control herself, how to not seem scared and to not start running as they approach; that only triggers them. The fairies doesn't know about her unusual talent... And she is determined for it to stay that way.However, when devastatingly beautiful Keenan shows interest for her, Ash realizes that she can't ignore them anymore. Keenan, who is the "Summer King" of the fairies wants her as his Queen; NEEDS her to be his queen. But Ash doesn't want that. She already has a special someone, though Seth seems to be oblivious to her feelings, and Ash works hard to conceal them anyway. She doesn't want anything to mess up their friendship. As Keenan refuses to give up, Seth proves to be the only one she can count on, the only one she can trust.This book truly was unbelievably good. It can't match Stephenie Meyers Twilight, but it was close enough.Melissa Marr has a way with words that makes you FEEL everything. I found myself talking to Ash, trying to will her to get away from Keenan. In the parts where she was with Seth, my thoughts were going something like "Oh COME ON, just kiss him!". You could really feel the sexual tension there, and Marr does not seem to be afraid of writing about those kinds of things.Along with that tension comes the tension of how in the world she's going to solve this. You want Ash to be with Seth, cause Seth's person is justsowonderful, and the harmony between them is so clear. But as the story evolves it doesn't seem possible. It seems as if Ash doesn't really have a choice...
