Wolfgang Goethe when he wrote The Sufferings of the Young Werther did not believe that his novel would be so successful. In German Literature, before the novel, there was still no romanesque work at Werther's height. All the romances that preceded him, which dealt with cards, were mostly neutral or cold. They emphasized more those who wrote to the narrator than the narrator himself. In Werther, for the first time, one sees a first-person narrator, an outstanding self. Werther suffers for love and counts through letters his feelings.It is a small but rather dense novel, with a plot full of strong scenes and human questions. Worth it.
