*****PERFECT TEN STARS*****February 2015 ReviewReading this series for the 4th time in preparation for the upcoming release of"Thoughtful"!!!!Most of my friends know this series is my#1 FAVE series of all time. Kellan Kyle is nothing less thanPERFECTin my eyes. I have loved no other book boyfriend more than him. Some have come close, but none have been able to dethrone him.This book is beyond angsty and I know that some think I am crazy to have read this 4 times. All I can say is that Kellan is worth all the heart break and suffering. I was supposed to BR this with my Bestie, but she has been so busy with work and the angst from this book was putting her over the edge, and so she bailed out. I completely understood. This is not an easy read.The last time I read"Thoughtless", I said that I understood Kiera. Yea, if I was in this situation, which God I wish I was, I would have fallen for Kellan instantly.BUT, I would have let Denny go right away. Even though he messed up by taking that job in Arizona, he still didn't deserve the betrayal by Kiera and Kellan. Kellan definitely wasn't an angel, but he's my #1 and so I'm not even going to attempt to crucify him in my review.This one was so unbelievably heart breaking because of how Kiera's selfishness tore Kellan apart. The girl definitely wanted to have her cake and eat it too, and she did have it for quite a while.There are so many things that I love about Kellan. He grew up, never knowing what it was like to be loved. All he ever received from his parents was abuse and contempt. Yet, as soon as he met Kiera, this man fell so deeply in love and did so many amazingly beautiful things for her. He was so desperately in love with her that he'd take what little she would give him. This might make him sound like a weak character, but the way S.C. Stephens depicted Kellan, it only made him so much more the swoonworthy book boyfriend!"What if I don't choose you, Kellan? What will you do?""I'll leave, Kiera. I'll leave, and you and Denny can have your happily ever after. You wouldn't even need to tell him about me. Eventually, the two of you.....the two of you would get married, and have children, and have a great life.""And you? What happens to you in that scenario?""I...get by. And I miss you, every day,"he whispered.I die a little every time I read that scene!! GAH!!Well I am so very excited than in five days I'm finally going to get inside Kellan's head when"Thoughtful"is released. I'm not expecting it to be an easy read, but I am so very happy to get to spend more time with my beautiful book boyfriend!!March 2013 review*****THIS BOOK WAS PERFECTION STARS*****Kellan Kyle will always be my #1!!I've read this book for the third time and it truly does get better each time.I fall more in love with Kellan. He's just that perfect!!I really hated Kiera when I first read this book but I feel like I understand her now.She was in this really impossible situation.It's quite impossible not to fall in love with Kellan and I realize at the same time how hard it would be to have to hurt someone as wonderful as Denny.He was her first love, her comfort.I think the only thing I find fault with Kiera is when she had sex with Denny right after professing her love to Kellan.Other than that I completely sympathize with Kiera.I truly love this series. It brings such utter heartbreak and joy to me :)
