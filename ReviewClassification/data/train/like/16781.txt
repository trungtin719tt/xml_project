Oh...my...GOD! :OFace expression after reading this book:This freaking book had so many twists and changes, I am still shocked right now. Its really hard for me to dissolve all the book, especially the ending, inside me, right now.Things happened so quickly in this book, I was left with a shocked face in the end. Thus proving this book was total win.Lemme just say this.The Iron Queen was full of epicness.(if thats even a word) And I just want the damn fourth book right now! xDThings I loved in this book:Meghan is now such a mature character, I couldn't possibly believe she was that selfish, annoying and irritating character in the beginning of the series. The way she fought and cared for everyone and how she sacrificed herself in the end was truly admirable. I love her now. =)Win#1Ash. This bad boy has now become one of my favorite heroes of all time. First I was totally like, hes emo and weird and just keeps everything to himself, but now looking at Prince Ash, all I could think is, "Daaayuumm, he IS something." ^.^ Hes hot and brave and a kind of boyfriend every girl in this freaking world deserves. Team Ash when hes with Meghan :DWin#2Puck. He is my favorite character in this book. I will always be TEAM PUCK, no matter what. And its not because he deserves Meghan or something, its because even though she didn't love him, he loved her and accepted her decision to be just friends. He always fought for her, made her smile and feel better, always supported her no matter what and I think no one in this book has suffered more than Puck, besides Ash. I think hes feels as much guilt as Ash for Ash's ex-girl friend's death and I just love him.Win#3The Story was really really good. Even though I didn't like Part 1 because of Meghan being against Puck, I adored Part 2 and 3. The story flowed and each and every scene was perfect in it's time. The ending was huge and marvelous and it just made me want to grab Iron Knight right now.Win#4Julie Kagawa. Do you know you are in my top 10 authors right now? She wrote this book beautifully and each and every part was described nicely. I am just surprised that how can an author write a book so good?! Julie Kagawa is a really amazing author and I won't even give a second thought before marking any of her other books as-read now.Win#5If theres anyone I love along with Puck and Ash, I would definitely say Grimalkin. This cat is such a nice character and I think if he wasn't there in this series, then Meghan and all would have been long dead. He was so sarcastic and confusing sometimes, even I was like ^_- when he said, "I am a cat." after each and every question.Win#6I love how the author also focuses on Meghan's family issues because most of the YA authors would have forgotten about them after the first book. I especially loved that moment when Meghan explains everything to her family and also when she calls Oberon "father". Her 2nd dad, Paul's mystery also got solved and I am just happy for her family. =)Win#7And do you know, theres a spin off of this series, in which her brother, Ethan is going to be the main hero?! I am just so excited to read more and more books related to this series. I will give this book 4.5/5 stars!-0.5 for Meghan slapping Puck. I was very sad. But anyways, :) Iron Knight, here I come. ;)
