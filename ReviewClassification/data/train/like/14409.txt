It's a brilliant &amp; thoroughly researched account of a multi-talented artist who suffered and worked till extremities. Michelangelo's life and his artwork is truly inspiring. He did everything what he believed he could not or should I say he was made to do it by pontiffs. Nonetheless, he excelled in everything.Too many Italian names while reading becomes a little annoying but then I got used to it gradually. Highly recommended.
