If you didn't have Calvin and Hobbes in your childhood, I personally feel sorry for you. This is a book that made me try to convince my mom as a kid to buy me a stuffed tiger... and then I tried to get her to upgrade my tiger by reasonably asking her to take me to a zoo, and help me pull a heist to get a non fabric based tiger, to one up Calvin essentially. :PI adore each of the characters even to this day, love how deep the content could be, while maintaining lots of hilarious plot lines to follow, and shenanigans that I as a little kid when my grandfather read it to me, only dreamed of doing.....I did manage to have some cardboard box adventures like he did, but minus the added bits of wisdom Calvin &amp; Hobbes had, and more of the "AHH, a treeeeeee." This is a book I one day want to read to my kids, and then can only hope they will pass it on to the next generation, this comic strip can only be described as a absolute gem. &lt;3
