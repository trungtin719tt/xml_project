*3.75/5*WHAT A JOURNEY THAT WAS. I may write a longer review later, but basically this book was amazing, a bit too much focus on religion for mepersonally, but overall I really enjoyed it. This book has a lot of the same elements thatThe Goldfinchhas, so I recommend giving this a try if you enjoyed that book, but some things just didn't 100% click for me. This is one of those books I feel like everybody should read though, because Owen Meany is an entirely unique character, and one that everybody needs to know about.
