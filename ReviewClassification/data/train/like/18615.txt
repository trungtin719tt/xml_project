Verily have I overshot myself in my vanity into thinking that I was ready to attempt this book. Humbled am I now.I probably got less than one-third of what Nietzsche was fulminating on. Maybe in another two reading or so... maybe with a different translation... ?Can anyone who has read this help me out? Is the second half of the book just plain abstruse or was it just me?
