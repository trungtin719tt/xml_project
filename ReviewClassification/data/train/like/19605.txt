I went in expecting sadness, misery, bleakness, joylessness, in the book. I can understand the popularity of the book. I got caught unawares. This is a book that can be recommended to everybody. There is a lot ofjoie de vivrepresent.This love of life is imbued in the short and fragile chapters of the book. There is a lesson present in most chapters, but I chose to read it as a thriller, instead of a fable. I really dreaded something horrible would happen to August.Instead we get a light-toned book that asks us to like it unconditionally. There is no need for suspending one's disbelief, no need to get pedantic. The multiple narrators don't matter since the focus is only on August. I raise my glass up, and say :"To August, the boy who lived!".
