This is the box set of book 1 to 3.I already had the non-box-set book, but my friend, Angelic_zaizai offered me the box set, and i can't help my self to refuse her offer.I was falling in love with Vampire Academy since i read the first book, because the idea of the story was so different with the Other-Popular-Vampire books.I mean, the main character is still 17 years old school girl like Bella and Zoey, yes... but Rose has a very strong character. She's smart, has good sense of humor, stubborn, and tough not clumsy...And that makes VA one step front of them.And the story of this book not tells about Love Story between human n vampire, this book tells about Dhampir (half human-half vampire) who trained to be a great guardian to protect Moroi (mortal vampire) from Strigoi (immortal Vampire, of course the bad one).And another reason why I love this book, because Rose (the Main character) is not a charming princess. She's just a dhampir. Even though she was popular.. (popular with her smartass reputation)This is a nice book, everybody will fallin love with Rose, with folklore about Moroi and Strigoi, and i think the plot's good too, good dialogs..a little bit rush in the beginning, but nice in the ending.But don't you try to give this book to your under 15 age sisters. Because this book doesn't shy about sex, there are a lot of parts when Rose tells us about BLOOD WHORE (Dhampir let Moroi drink their blood during sex).
