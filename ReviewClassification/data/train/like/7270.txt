Reader thoughts:Max is a sarcastic and tough teen with amazing wings. She's leader of her flock of bird kids, and they work hard to stay away from the troublesome adult scientists. Max struggles to keep her flock together, discover her destiny, and save the world while she's at it.Finding their parents would be a nice bonus, too, if only the whitecoats would stop trying to kill them.(Sadly, only the first 3 books of the series are good. But they are so good!)Writer thoughts:It's amazing that JP can pull off such a fast-paced book with so many hilarious and sarcastic comments. The pacing and timing blend very well to push the reader to the end without thought for the outside world.However, there is little to no resolution in any of these books, which catches up the readers in book 4. It's like in Series of Unfortunate Events; loose ends can only be interesting for so long. Random is fast and creates mystery, but it doesn't create satisfaction.
