The blurb:When Quoyle's two-timing wife meets her just desserts, he retreats with his two daughters to his ancestral home on the starkly beautiful Newfoundland coast, where a rich cast of local characters and family members all play a part in Quoyle's struggle to reclaim his life. As Quoyle confronts his private demons--and the unpredictable forces of nature and society--he begins to see the possibility of love without pain or misery. A vigorous, darkly comic, and at times magical portrait of the contemporary North American family, The Shipping News shows why Annie Proulx is recognized as one of the most gifted and original writers in America today.My comments: A slow-moving tale. An excellent read combining heartbreak, healing and pulling it all together when a community of people with their own stories to share, become the backbone of a new life for Quoyle and his two daughters. Folk tales, family secrets, history, and nature become characters in the book. The book offers a full menu of emotions served with rich tales of the fishing community who battle it out against natural disasters and life's unexpected challenges. Informative and entertaining. Excellent prose spread all over the plot and story line.I just loved being there! However ....... I don't want to live there for sure! You have to be born there to survive it all. Meeting the characters, though, enriched my life immensely. I just fell in love with them all.RECOMMENDED!
