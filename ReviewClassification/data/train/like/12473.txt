As this is my third reread of this book, so I'm not going to write a long-winded review, as I think I've said most of what needs to be said about this book in a previous review.This book is still as amazingly beautiful, as the first time I read it. The only thing I am certain of, is that Tolkien's works never tire in your mind, and they somehow become even better, each time you read them. I just love this trilogy.
