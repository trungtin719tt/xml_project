This was a tough one to rate. Of the 630 pages, about 200 of them were not great, weird, too much, 1 to 2 stars. A couple of times I wondered why I was still reading and didn't want to go on.But, the other 430 were very interesting and well written. The premise of the story is fascinating and left me pondering a lot of what ifs?. It was very deeply researched historical fiction and I am a fan of decent historical fiction. If the 200 pages or so that I didn't care for were edited out or abbreviated, I may have given it 5 stars.To sum it up - the author seems to have an interest in historical fiction, gratuitous sex, rape/S&amp;M fantasies, and homo-erotic torture. The first of those she is good at. The second was not too bad at first, but after about 100 straight pages of it it got to be a bit much. The last two were a bit disturbing.If you have an interest historical fiction and a high tolerance for questionable sex, give it a shot!
