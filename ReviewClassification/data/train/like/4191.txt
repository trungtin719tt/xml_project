Wow!! Oh wow!! What can I say! This book was emaculent! This was by far the most moving book I've ever read! I'm partially embarrassed to say that I cried all through this book; for I never cry at books. However this one continually brought tears to my eyes and a pain in my heart. This book was sad- a good sad. This is a book that not only told you the pains and terrible predicaments but also showed where they were given strength! It showed who never left them even in the darkest of places! Who stayed with them when no one else could! Who was their hiding place in time of need! This book was brilliant! Writing was fantastic and story telling wonderful! This book is on my list of favorite books because this book moved me and reminded me that wherever I go the Lord will be there too- my hiding place!!!God Bless,Always remember Jesus Loves You!!~Mary Kate(:
