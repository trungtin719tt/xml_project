Extraordinary novel which still resonates!! I remembered enjoying Ray Bradbury's Fahrenheit 451 several years ago. This time, it felt even more powerful. There are some great dystopian novels out there--1984, Handmaid's Tale, Brave New World, Oryx &amp; Crake. Many others come to mind. What's different about Fahrenheit 451 is the sense that it is okay to hope for better days. Margaret Atwood's Handmaid's Tale, for instance, ends well after Offred's story has ended and Gilead is an academic subject rather than an oppressive government. Despite the acts of resistance in the narrative, optimism is in short supply. While there is concern that knowledge is under attack (both in Fahrenheit 451 and in current debates), Bradbury lets us hope that knowledge will win out, that the future will win out.
