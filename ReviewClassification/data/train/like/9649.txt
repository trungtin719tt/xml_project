Couldn't put this book down. Really easy read. Well crafted crime mystery novel with a raw flavor to the details that makes it all feel more real and really gets you hooked.Loved this book so much I went on to read the author's second novel 'The Zombie Room'. Also a good read.R.D. Ronald is known for his rocky relationship with the law. His work is inspired by the time he spent in prison for drug distribution, having grown weed for his wife to help her with her battle with cancer. It's an interesting story.His writing reflects the plight of working class people getting in to sticky situations just trying to make ends meet, and survive.... the authenticity of this story and the characters I think stem from his experiences, and it really makes a big difference for me as a reader. I highly recommend this book!
