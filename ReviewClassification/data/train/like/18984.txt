I'm not crying, you're crying.No, but, I had the ending of this book told to me before I ever got to read it, and I was still blown away by it. I love Ellen Hopkins and this was another in a long line of her books that went straight to my heart.I loved Pattyn and I loved the story, even if the idea of her loving Ethan went a little fast to me.
