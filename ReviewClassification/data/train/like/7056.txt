You know, I really feel bad for deleting my entire review because six people liked it. I'm not sure why, as it was me simply ranting indulgently about how much I loved this book.Take into consideration that I was young and innocent and unaware of young-adult powerhouses likeThe Hunger GamesandShiverwhen I read this. As I continue to read more of this series, it continues to disappoint.What I'm getting at is that I'm not sure if I would grant this book five stars once I re-read it now, as an older and more critical reviewer. However, I would feel guilty for bumping it down without re-reading it. Therefore, I will leaveEvermoreat five stars even though it might not deserve it.All I remember is that Damen was hot and there was an awesome gay character. Enough said for me when I was twelve/thirteen. There might have been other positive characteristics like a plot of some kind, but once again, I forget.Adios! If you want to read some of my more current reviews or my writing in general, you can find ithere.*update May 24, 2011 - so I lied, I'm bumping this one down to 4.5 stars. I still haven't found time to re-read it, but I did skim through the book at Borders the other day and found nothing particularly five-star worthy. SorryEvermorefans!
