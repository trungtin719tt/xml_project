This is Goethe's Romeo and Juliet. This is Goethe's masterpiece. It's a tragedy and a love story all rolled together and it's hard to say which description is more accurate. Yes it's an unrequited love, a one way passion of the heart and mind. But isn't that the nature of most love affairs? By today's standards it would be considered an obsession, and maybe it was in 18th century Germany as well. But there is no denying Werther's love. His love for Charlotte was the gift of his heart."......a whole eternity could not extinguish the living flame which was yesterday kindled by your lips, and which now burns within me. She loves me! These arms have encircled her waist, these lips have trembled upon hers. She is mine! Yes, Charlotte, you are mine forever".
