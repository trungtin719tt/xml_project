(edited this with some expanding thoughts:) The story of a woman half-forced to indenpendence, having to find her way in a foreign, largely Catholic country; to find a satisfying job and perhaps love. It's not a straight, clear road that she might've hoped for, but something that makes her grow(view spoiler)[into mature, independent stability that is not without implied (or clear, if you view it so) tragedy(hide spoiler)].One has to remember while reading this that certain prejudices of Catholic religion from a British protestant point of view appear in the text, but it's not so heavy that I couldn't finish it, and it's somewhat in the background. This book shows also yet again what a great mind (and later what a great loss we had) in Charlotte Bronte.Reading this I found myself rooting for her survival, her independence and stability of mind (there's one rather hallucinatory scene in one chapter). I also found the writing tight (no feel of 'needs to be shorter') yet with great moods. I enjoyed this book all the way, and will read it again. Recommended.
