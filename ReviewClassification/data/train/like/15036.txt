Maybe I'm feeling slightly defensive, but I honestly believe some of the best books written today are in the childrens/young adult section. Well, the Bartimaeus trilogy by Jonathan Stroud is a book that fits completely into the great books written for children. This is one of my favorite childrens book of all time, primarily because of the great characterization of its protagonist, Bartimaeus. Bartimaeus lives in a world where magicians gain their power not from magic, but rather controlling otherworld entities through words and symbols. Bartimaeus is a middle-ranking genie, not especially powerful, but smart enough to outdo alot of the other guys. he's also slightly evil... or so you'd think. he gets called up by an aspiring young apprentice intent on revenge. and adventure ensues. I would highly suggest reading the remaining two books in the series, as they just get better as they go along, and add depth to the first book. The whole series is inventive and entertaining, and a very good read.
