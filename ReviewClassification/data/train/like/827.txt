The next asteroid the Little Prince came to was inhabited by a Quiz Addict. He sat hunched in front of his laptop, and barely looked up when the Little Prince greeted him. There was nowhere else to sit, since the whole asteroid was covered in books."Good morning!" said the Little Prince."I'm sorry, I don't have time to talk to you," said the Quiz Addict. "I am very busy. Wait. InTwilight, what color was Edward's car?""I don't know," said the Little Prince. "I have never read this bookTwilight.""I think it was blue," said the man. "Damn! I was wrong. Silver. InTwilight, who joined the Cullen family first?""I told you," said the Little Prince, "that I haven't read this book. But it must be an interesting book if you answer questions about it all day long. I would very much like to read it.""It is the stupidest book ever written!" said the man."Then why do you answer questions about it all day long?" asked the Little Prince."Because if I don't," sighed the man, "then my friend on asteroid B451 will get ahead of me. "He has read the whole series. Luckily, he hasn't readHarry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.""When you have finished the Quiz," asked the Little Prince, "I hope you will be able to read some of these books you have around you? I notice that you have hadAtonementon your to-read list for the last six months.""It is a Never-Ending Quiz," answered the man. "InTwilight, what color was Edward's car?""I believe you said silver?" answered the Little Prince politely."Thank you," muttered the man. "Yes! You were right. I should have known that.""I'm sorry, I must be going," said the Little Prince. And he went on his way, thinking that grown-ups were very, very, very strange.
