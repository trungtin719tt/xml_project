OMG, I loved this book. It drew me in, took me for a wild ride into the moroi and dhampir world and I really hated to turn the last page. But luckily for me, the journey is not over as there are more books waiting for me. These first three books had me sitting on the edge of my seat (not to mention keeping me up at night trying to stop myself from reading another chapter) I can't remember reading another book that had me laughing at Rose's actions, rooting for her when she stood her ground or gasping when she did something I didn't see coming.I'm going to dive into the rest of the series now seeing as I'm not ready to write an in-depth review. Still to buzzed/hyped/emotional for it.But yeah, recommending this to everyone I know that likes to read.
