This book takes a wide turn in Ben Peller's "To Live" trilogy, and finds Shawn Michals on an island seemingly in the middle of nowhere. I was very impressed that the island itself displayed a feminine energy that seemed to not be as well represented in "To Live and Drink In L.A." and "To Live and Love In L.A."(although I did still enjoy both of them). Now we have Bina, a mysterious and powerful feminine spirit who leads Shawn on a path he is terrified by yet destined for. This book reminded me of Hermann Hesse's "Steppenwolf," another classic I loved. Keep writing, Ben Peller. You're growing!
