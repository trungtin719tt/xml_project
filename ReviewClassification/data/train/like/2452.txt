Seuss's most cynical political work describes the cycle of every generation: first you hate the machine, then you rage against the machine, then you embrace the machine, then you become the machine.Sally and her brother, who, like Dostoevsky'ssick manand Ralph Ellison'sInvisible Man,will remain unnamed, join with the force of revolution, embodied by the Cat in the Hat. Together they recruit agents of change and chaos - the furious Things One and Two - to dismantle the oppressive world built by their parents.The ensuing freedom proves too much for them, though. They turn against the Cat, and finally they capture and cage Things One and Two. Meanwhile the Cat in the Hat literally becomes the machine:His promise of anarchic freedom is a facade. In fact he is an agent of stasis, and everything is put neatly back just as it was. The revolution will be reset. Sally and her brother have become what they rebelled against. The idealism of another generation is crushed under the weight of convention. And what willyoudo, when your mother asks you?
