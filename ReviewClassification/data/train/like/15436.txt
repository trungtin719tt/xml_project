Now I remember why I had fell in love with this book when I was younger and so disappointed for not having reading the other books in this series. I don't know the story is just so different? Compelling? The writing is simple but the concept and the relationships are much more deeper. I do not regret finishing this past 3am on a school night!Also I don't know for which team I fight for anymore, I'm torn.
