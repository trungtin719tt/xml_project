Rating: 5 stars :)Original Rating:4 starsOriginally read:May 2014Reread:July 2016I bought this book on a whim at a secondhand bookstore and re-read it in one day. I just adore this wonderful book. Even though it semi-follows Dessen's signature plot line, it was also written early enough in her career that there were enough elements to differentiate it from the bunch.When it works, love is pretty amazing. It's not overrated. There's a reason for all those songs.Remy has been through a lot in her life, but she's lucky enough to have friends that can get through her thick, stubborn skull and call her out. Truth Squad, of course is just as quirky and disfunctionally perfect as any band starting out, and I love them with all my heart. And who can forget about the cast and customers of Joie's? Ah, salons.As always, the side characters were just as interesting and dynamic and lovable as the main character(s).Love is needing someone. Love is putting up with someone's bad qualities because they somehow complete you.I would love to talk toSarah Dessenabout the character of Remy's mother, the dramatic romance writer Barbara Starr, and her life as an author. I'm so curious! Does Barbara's author life mirror Dessen's? Or are there a couple elements that do? Or maybe Barbara Starr is the writer Dessen always made fun of- the stereotypical author Dessen loves to mock. So many questions!The fate of your heart isyourchoice, and no one else gets a vote.As always, Dessen managed to wrap up the book in a way so that everything, characters, plot, etc., had come full circle. Maybe the pacakge didn't have a cute little bow, but at least it was wrapped. And isn't that all us readers ever want?Oh, and one last thing -HATE SPINNERBAIT.Reread:December 2018My gods, this is an adorable book. I just love all of the characters, and I wish I lived in a reality where I could meet them all and tell them how awesome they are. A fantastic book! A wonderful, easy, read for a lazy winter break :)
