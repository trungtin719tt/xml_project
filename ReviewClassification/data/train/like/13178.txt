The Awakening is even more enticing and action packed than its prequel. While the setting shifts, it is no less menacing as Chloe and the gang face a grim and tretcherous life on the streets. Tension is heightened by the added appeal of a perfectly sinister and powerful enemy and the suspense of unknown supernatural powers. Armstrong's teen characters are smart and resourceful, and each obstacle thrown their way requires them to use every bit of caution, wits, and intelligence they possess. Armstrong focuses a little more on the technical aspects of the teens' powers and abilities, especially as Derek and Chloe explore their capabilities and restraints. Their difficulties and the tension that they face help them grow as characters and make them more appealing. My crush on Derek has increased ten fold. The Awakening is a dark, gripping, and highly suspenseful read will have readers staying up to all hours of the night and leave them desperate for the next installment!
