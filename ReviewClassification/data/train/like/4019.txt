It has been a while since I last was online (according to this computer's calculations: thirteen days ago) &amp; since then I have finished the monumentally loved "Beloved."The only way I can describe this sure classic is: "it's a mix between the most brilliant of Hawthorne (his Scarlet Letter bears plenty of similarities to Beloved since it too deals with a time of intense persecution in this country; the roles women played at such historical crossroads; the ghosts of the burdensome past making cameos in the present; haunted house motifs galore... and the secret history which comes back again and again) &amp; the vibrant poetry of Maya Angelou."This was written in the 198-! Hardly a long time ago, it was analyzed/embraced then as it is now for its hodgepodge of ghost story elements, &amp; romance, and historical biography. Because slavery is such a muddy record in our books, it is certain documents like these, which widen the scope significantly to include various P.O.V.s &amp; jumps in time, that are truly significant to American Literature. The book mirrors the psyche of a woman who chooses liberating death for her child, rather than the awful clutch of slavery. It decidedly marks a usually-undocumented moment when ex-slaves got something close to freedom-- and had to find out how to live, survive, or try to make way for the upcoming generation-- outside of slavery.
