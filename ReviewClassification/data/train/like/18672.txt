This is actually my second time reading this awesome timeless masterpice!!!Here you have a great lovestory, then also a historic novel and also a political thriller ..Let me put it this way: "Quo Vadis" will blow you away!!!Also it's not a cliche that I say: I coud not put it down..This novel simple is indeed so good that I had to get on reading even although with itching eyes and tired!!!"Quo Vadis" will enhance and inspire your faith as a christian, but even if you are not yet a christian you shoudn't ommit this literary jewel and bereave yourself in this way!!!At the end of the day it's up to you, but let me tell you that if you want to advance your literary skills and at the same time are willing to let you sweep away by this powerful narration, then you have clearly only one choice to make: read it!!!For my part I can say that I was raptured to another estrange and perilous world, Nero and his delusions.. a murder and also an antichrist, his hands full of innocent blood!!!This novel, like the "Titanic" is also an allegory to our present time in various levels and ways..Our society sadly to say is also marked by a chronic injustice and much bloodshed !!Also we have the so called elite which live in their delusions and artificial world!!!So, yes!!! a great novel indeed.. it hasn't lost the power of his voice to our present reality..I want to conclude by saying that I love "Quo Vadis" by Sienkiewicz, this novel it's much more than a mere classic, it's an event with the inner dwelling power of transforming your consciosness and awareness..After reading "Quo Vadis" you will see things in different ways because of your growing realization and awareness!!!So, yes, five stars and to all my goodreads friends:Happy reading..l!!!Dean;D
