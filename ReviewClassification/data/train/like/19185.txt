A dizzy ride. You could say a dizzy dame except Lizzie Stafford Hamilton changes. Her character arc is a swooping adventure of the best kind. But at such cost to those around her. And did I love Li or what? And Kit. And Appetite Ike. Longfellow births the most amazing people. They're real. What they do is what they would do. And every scene follows the other at breathtaking pace, in perfect order. Loved this. You want a fast read that means something, that touches you? Here it is. Although why people want everything to be fast these days saddens me.
