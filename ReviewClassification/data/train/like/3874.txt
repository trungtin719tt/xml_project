This is become my favorite book. I've read all my life. I think of myself as a discerning reader. All the classics: English, Russian, German, French, American...and more and more. And some of these books have never left me. This is going to be one of them. I notice it's not on any bestseller list and it's not not mentioned by the professionals as brilliant, and yet it's the most brilliant thing I've read in years. It has it all: great writing, a great idea, profound research, profound ideas, and a compelling storyline that takes you on an alternate journey through a story you think you know. Mary Magdalene here is not a whore or a penitent sinner. She's wise and funny and vulnerable. And she's not regulated to the carrier of Christ's child. I was stunned. Several times I wanted to shout: YES! I'VE THOUGHT THAT! A revelation and a keeper.
