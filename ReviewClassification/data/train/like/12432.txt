Whew! I finally finished it! It took me almost 2 weeks. That is the longest it has ever taken for me to read a book. This book was quite the undertaking but well worth it. I have never been much of a Stephen King fan, but I enjoyed this one. I take my hat off to King for the ability to write such a complex novel with so many characters &amp; story lines merging into one. What a fantastic smooth read. The characters came to life! While reading it, I almost felt as if I was part of the story, living it. Oddly, I am sorry it's over. I have read several books by King and this is the first one I have truly liked.
