Not for the faint of heart. The first part of the book is horrific in the abuse Acheron suffers. Serious tear jerker stuff; he's abused in the worst ways literally from the moment of birth. Just horrific. I did love his sister, Ryssa. Reading about Ash's beginnings with Artemis really mad me hate the 'old bitch heifer-goddess' as Simi calls her. I had started to think her okay from Kat's book, but nope, totally an awful, vindictive, selfish, controlling bitch.The second half of the book seems so much less after the nonstop horrors of the first part. It's short and sweet. I've read others complaining that Ash should've been paired with a kickass Amazon kinda chick, I disagree. I think Tory's softer intellect focused personality is perfect. She's all about ancient civilizations &amp; research, everything else, but food, is a very distant second thought - especially the opinion of the masses. In this way she's able to appreciate Acheron most for his knowledge, not his exceptional looks. She wants to ravage his brain, not his body.The ending...not sure I agree with it, especially Apollymi's actions worry me for future books. As Stryker's book is next, we'll see how that plays out. Wish there'd been more Simi &amp; Katra. Loved Tori's friends.Still waiting for someone to oust Artemis from Olympus. There has to be a better option around, even a Venus fly trap plant would be better. Or a slug.
