I collect Christmas books and would eagerly scour the shelves for the newest stories each season, but for whatever reason I did not buy nor read The Polar Express - it just did not appeal to me. Then in 1987 I took my two daughters to Seattle via Amtrak to attend Maurice Sendak's stage setting of the Christmas classic The Nutcracker. Before going to the ballet, the girls and I spent an afternoon at a Christmas exhibit at the University of Washington and chanced to happen upon an older gentleman who looked suspiciously like Santa Claus in an off-duty moment: rocking in his chair, neatly trimmed white beard, red suspenders, nondescript trousers and flannel shirt. He smiled when he saw us walking by and asked if we'd like to hear a story. We sat down at his feet and were spellbound by the magic of his words as he wove the story of a Polar Express.I really don't like the movie version, but the warmth of the storyteller all those years ago is a special memory that brings back a smile.p.s. Traveling from Montana to Seattle and back again in the middle of winter is traveling through a winter wonderland that will take your breath away, especially if you're traveling by train and don't have to think about driving.
