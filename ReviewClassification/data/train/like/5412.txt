There's a reason everyone recommends this trilogy. It really is that good. I flew through this (granted it really isn't long) and loved every second! It's essentially 5 short stories that follow one another and need to be read in order. I'm very keen to read the rest of the Foundation novels when I'm finished with my 2014 challenge.The investigation of science, religion and trade, and how they can work together and against one another is remarkably well done. It was unusual to read Asimov sans robots, but of course he didn't disappoint. Highly recommended to anyone and everyone!The introduction tells the story of how Isaac Asimov came up with the idea for this series (the fall of the Roman Empire in space basically) and how the original publication proceeded. The interesting part came when he'd completed the trilogy and was very much done with the Foundation novels, but could not escape their popularity and was eventually strongly persuaded by his publishing company to write more Foundation novels. When he re-read his trilogy, he found that he did have a lot of unanswered questions and there was a lot more to write, and so he wrote the sequels and prequels. I'll be reading this series in publishing order.
