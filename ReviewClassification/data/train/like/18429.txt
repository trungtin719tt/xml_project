I started this series with a bit of trepidation back in 2015. I knew that JD Robb also wrote as Nora Roberts and I had read another book by Ms Roberts and hated it ... so I was a bit wary about starting the In Death books. But I had heard great things about Roarke. Another reason that put me off reading this series is because he is Irish and, being Irish, if it is not done right, it drives me nuts. But she pulled it off. He is perfection.I am already up to book 19 but decided to head back to book 1 and do a quick recap of how they met and their initial reactions to each other. OMG. I loved it.... he turned his head, looked five pews back across the aisle and directly into Eve's eyes. It was surprise that had her fighting not to jolt at that sudden and unexpected punch of power. It was will that kept her from blinking or shifting her gaze. For one humming minute they stared at each other ..."You fascinate me, Lieutenant Dallas."We meet Mavis, Feeney, Whitney ... Summerset. Yes, I can see now how they started off on the wrong foot. Bit of a poker up his arse alright, Eve. But you take no shit from him.Galahad, she thought. Her white knight.I highly recommend this series.MY ORIGINAL REVIEW - DECEMBER 2105 ...****************************************Well, they say "practice makes perfect" - would love to know who THEY are. Read Nora Roberts years ago and thought it was the greatest load of shite I had ever read - an Irish themed book - I am Irish so a bit sensitive. So totally avoided her forever. Read some forums on Amazon and GRs about Roarke and Eve and thought who are they - In Death - J. D Robb aka Nora Roberts - NO THANK YOU. But then again I saw that a lot of my GR friends are fans of JD so decided to bite the bullet and jump on the bandwagon.... OKAAAAAY -Naked in Death- freaking loved it. Was this the same woman who wrote about and Irish girl who trained a horse for the Kentucky Derby - cannot even remember the storyline now cos it totally pissed me off. Irish people are not like Darby O'Gill and the Little People or like Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman in Far and Away or whatever it was ... OK, we see our kids progress through school and improve over the years and definitely Ms Roberts did this. Will I go back and read a Nora Roberts book after this/ Not sure, maybe, probably as I can see a definite improvement in her writing style.... so do not understand how many of you gaveIrish Heartssuch high ratings - us Irish coleens are not as dimwitted or innocent as she was ,,,, Deliver us lord from every evil!!! Now I am totally depressed cos I realise that if I have to read the whole IN DEATH series it is going to cost me a feckin' fortune. Goodnight. 23.20 here in Belgium so time for bed! ..... and if I had known it was set in the future I definitely would not have read it but it totally blends in and you do not notice it.
