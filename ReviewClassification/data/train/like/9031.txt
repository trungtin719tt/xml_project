What is the meaning of life? Well, the answer seems to be hidden in a scrap of Persian rug.This is the story of an unforgettable fictional "character" named Philip Carey and his extremely tumultuous and tormented life from age 9 thru 30.Poor Philip is only nine years of age when his beloved mother dies in childbirth and he is sent off to the vicarage to live with his strict, overbearing Uncle William and loving Aunt Louisa. Born with a club-foot and small for his age, Philip is shy and embarrassed by his deformity and is often lonely and pegged an outcast.In his search for freedom and affection,OF HUMAN BONDAGEdescriptively depicts Philip's various vocations, friendships, precarious love life and education.....as well as his love of books."Insensibly he formed the most delightful habit in the world, the habit of reading: he did not know that thus he was providing himself with a refuge from all the distress of life; he did not know either that he was creating for himself an unreal world which would make the real world of every day a source of bitter disappointment."Throughout the reading of this complex semi-autobiographical novel, I often becamesofrustrated with Philip that I just wanted to shake his obsession with the vile, grungy waitress Mildred right out of him! OMGOSH.....he wassogullible and indecisive, it drove me crazy......BUThe was also a kind, likeable "character" generous to an indescribable fault, good-hearted and most of all......willing to forgive.Originally published in 1915, this memorable classic is one hell of an "intimate tale of human relationships." What a story!
