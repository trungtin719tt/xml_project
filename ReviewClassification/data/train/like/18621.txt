Though I doubt that I could read the German version as easily as I once could, I still much prefer it to the translations. If you must read a translation, make it the Walter Kaufmann version, which is, in any case, easiest to find beyond being the best that I have seen. Side note: Kaufmann's translation of Goethe's Faust is also one of the best you will find for that work.As for the work itself, what can I possibly say that has not already been written in praise of this epic? The criticism one most often hears of this work is that it is inconsistent in both theme and narration. How this ever came to be seen as a legitimate critique is beyond me...the work is cogent from start to finish, but not if one reads it as a manifesto. Zarathustra is not laying down a new religion from start to finish. He is developing one, thinking aloud and learning from his experiences. It would seem that readers expect this to be a traditional piece of wisdom writing in which the narrator already has "all the answers" from the beginning. Zarathustra is not a pedagogue; Nietzsche would not write such a patronizing character. Zarathustra's reasoning is imperfect, is human, and his journey to "enlightenment" is meant to be the reader's journey. When reading this book, do not expect that it will provide you with perfect wisdom at every step. Rather, it shows the development of the idea over the course of the story, and what we have is not a series of contradictions (as some have lamely asserted) but rather a visibly growing light, culminating with Zarathustra's triumphant cry: 'Dies ist mein Morgen! Mein Tag hebt an!' This is my morning. My day begins! And so he leaves the dark mountains shining like the 'Morning Sun.'
