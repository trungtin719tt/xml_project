Second Reading - September 2016First Reading - August 2015In a genre that really tests our limits to endure the dehumanization and suffering of others, this text stands out as entirely different. WWII Holocaust literature is critically important to the story of Western Civilization and it is essential that we all have a few titles get through us so that we never forget what hate and godlessness can do to entire nations.While The Hiding Place has some genuinely tough passages, it is totally unique in that it is never ever hopeless. The very worst moments are lightened up the beautiful witness of Betsey who truly understands the Gospel.Like the Old Testament lamp that never ran out of oil and the Ravensbruck vitamin bottle that never ran out of medicine until new medicine was provided, this story is miraculous in it's ability to keep you filled with just enough hope and just enough awe to keep reading without feeling gutted.To be thankful for the fleas - because they provided incredible miraculous protection from something much worse - is the epitome of the message of the ten Booms and their beautiful true story.Reader who does not think that they can read one more Holocaust book, I understand. I resisted this one for years. Now I understand. I wish that I had read this at the same time that I had read In My Hands and others - it would have given me a healthier helping of hope. 75% of this book is not about the concentration camps. Most of this story is about the real people and their real lives before, during and after the war.This is a classic. A healing and hopeful classic.
