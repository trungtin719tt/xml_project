I more than enjoy Longfellow's historical novels, but this one really surprised me. I wound up not knowing my own knees from my elbows. I had no idea what to expect and that's what I got. A story told in first person as if the reader were that person, and you go along, gradually learning why you're in Vermont and why you're in River House and what you've done. But you're never prepared for what you're going to do next. You think you could never do these things, that you're not that kind of person, but you're wrong. You don't think much of your work (you're a writer) but you think way too much of the work of others even as you hate their lives. And you hate your life. But you cling to it even as it becomes a funhouse of mad mirrors. I once saw a movie called Angel Heart and as soon as I finished it, I started it all over again just to see how it was made. I watched it again to marvel at the symbols and signals placed in every frame telling the story visually. I intend reading this a few times more for exactly the same reason.
