ode to a dragon-tattooed girlshall i compare thee to a cinematic adaptation of one of my favorite books?thou art more genuine and less mass marketable.rough cgi does shake my sense of disbelief,and the movie's adaptation hath all too short a running time.sometimes too overemphasized the plot and action sequences,and often the depth of character dimmed.and every sequel from prequel's quality declines,by chance, or budgets allowed to expand, untrimmed.but thy entertainment value shall not fadenor be compromised by translation from one medium to anoth'r.nor shall bloggers brag that the original was betterwhen in eternal lines to time thou ares't original.so long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,so long lives this: the book was better, and so are thee.
