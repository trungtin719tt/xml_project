The second act of the classic Lord Of The Rings saga is divided into two halves; the second half focussing on Frodo, Sam and Gollum and the first half focussing on the rest of the divided fellowship.To be honest, I love this book so much, it's virtually impossible for me to write a balanced review. If you're also a fan, you know exactly what I mean, so I'll leave it there. :-DBuddy read with Sunshine Seaspray.-----------------------------------------------Re-read in 2017: If anything, I love it more than ever now. :-D
