I've just finished and all I can say isholy shuck! This book is awesome!I was a little bit scared when I started this book that I wasn't going to like it as it is my first real dystopia/sci-fi book I've read. After about 110 pages it got to the point where I couldn't put it down for anything even while eating dinner I had it one hand and when bedtime came I wanted to stay up all night and read it.The plot was fast paced, suspenseful and full of suprises. The twists and turns this book took shocked me unlike any other book I've read. It also has some creative lingo but I found it easy to understand and I actually think it added to this books charm. The ending was amazing but left me with so many questions that I need answers for RIGHT NOW and I really wish October 12th would hurry up so I can read The Scorch Trials.All I have to say is read this book (especially you, Morgan :D).
