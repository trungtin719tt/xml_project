What would Henry say to us now in this age of disposable cell phones and multiple mortgages hanging over our heads?Waldenis just good writing. It's insightful and witty. It's even quirky, but Thoreau hits the nail on the head so many times in his observations about nature, and more importantly, about man.Thoreau is...The scholarly forest rangerThe anarchist hoeing his beansThe whittling poet philosopherThe original hippieThe loner that could have been a statesmanThe botanist abolitionistI highly recommended this classic.
