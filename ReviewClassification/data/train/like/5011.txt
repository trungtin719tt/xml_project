Even people living in actual caves have read it so it was about time I did too.With that said, I probably don't have anything different to say from the rest of the people but my GOD it was good. Sure a bit predictable but it was fun reading it.Science fiction is not my thing (except for TMR series) so I wasn't expecting to like itthismuch.So good.
