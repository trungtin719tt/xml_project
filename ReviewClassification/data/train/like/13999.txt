My Macbeth's second read.Written in an economy prodigy, one of Shakespeare's shorter pieces, based on accounts of wars between noble lineages in England, Scotland and Ireland, Macbeth is one of the author's bloodiest tragedies. Of the protagonists only two survive, it is the tragedy par excellence of human ambition. The tragedy in Scotland tells the story of Macbeth, one of King Duncan's generals, successful in his fight with the rebels. He is visited by three witches who predict their fate as future landlord and king of England. Lady Macbeth, wife of the general, plot for the king's death to put her husband in place. Fearful, Macbeth hesitates to take part in his wife's plan, but kills the king in his sleep with his blood-stained hands. Macbeth reflects on whether he made the right decision by taking that action. After the assassination of the king, Macbeth is crowned and lives moments of glory. However, Macbeth fears Banquo, the other general, who rivals him in cunning and intelligence and for whom the witches predicted that he would be the future king with his lineage, while Macbeth would not have heirs, reigning for that. Macbeth then hires two assassins to kill him, but Banquo's son Fleance escapes from death. Macbeth then begins to be haunted by the ghost of Banquo, who leads him to madness, then begin the intrigues on the part of the nobles to depose Macbeth. In visiting witches, Macbeth receives councils of apparitions that foretell Macduff's intention take the throne and also the lineage of Banquo. Malcolm, the son of the former king and Macduff, then found themselves in England and asked the king for help in deposing Macbeth, for Siward and ten thousand men borrowed by the King of England. In Scotland, Lady Macbeth goes mad and starts wiping her hands without stopping, to get rid of the blood that torments her and begins to say disconnected words. The battle is approaching and Macbeth, maddened, seeks to make sense of the words spoken by the witches. Lady Macbeth dies in her own room, and the English army is approaching with branches of trees in hand, confirming the prophecy that one day the grove would come to the castle. After the match, Macbeth is killed and only Malcolm, Ross, Macduff and other soldiers remain, crowning Malcolm as the new king.
