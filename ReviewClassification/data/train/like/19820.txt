This is the story of the rise and fall of Michael Henchard, a hot-tempered, proud and irascible hay-trusser who in a drunken haze, sells his wife and baby girl to a sailor at a fair, for five guineas.He regrets his deed the next day, but can not find his wife and child. Entering a church, he kneels by the altar and vows to stay sober for 21 years and do good and be charitable.But can he rise above his anger, pride, obstinacy, jealousy, sense of rivalry and impulsiveness?Would he be able to prevent the life and name he has built for himself from unraveling? Could he fight fate?This is a story of misunderstandings; of suffering the consequences of transgressions; of self-punishment and regrets and of longing to be loved and cherished.This is a tragedy.
