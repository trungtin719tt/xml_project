I had never read a single book in this series. Fans know there are a great many of them now. I read the synopis on the back of the book and was instantly put off by the futuristic setting. I really don't like Science fiction and anything set in the future. History is my big thing. But, I kept hearing how good these books were, so I picked up a used copy of the first one and could not put it down.Now, if you have read Nora Roberts and think this is some extension of her other stuff, think again. I was shocked by the language and the just little bit of kink thrown in there. I couldn't believe this was the same author. ( It wasn't over done, just not her style when writing as Nora Roberts.) But, when you stripped it bare, it was a detective/crime drama set in the future with a little romance thrown in for good measure. I hear maybe Roarke makes a return in her next installment. I sure hope so.Eve Dallas is a take no prisoners detective. She can't remember anything before her eighth birthday. But, has memory flashes that hint at abuse. Eve would rather not remember. When a "paid companion" is murdered, her prominent family wants Eve to investigate. One of her first suspects is a billionare that was seen having dinner with the victim. Then two more women are killed. Corruption within the force,politics, lies, blackmail and murder. It's all there. Plus, Eve is finally able to start dealing with her own troubled past.If you haven't read these books, I highly recommend giving them a try.
