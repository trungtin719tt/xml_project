They say opposites attract and for Jamie Sullivan and Landon Carter this was true. Jamie was the daughter of a small town baptist minister. Jamie was a sweet, kind girl who liked to volunteer at orphanages and rescue animals. Everywhere she went she carried her bible and she never put on make up and didn't mix with the so called cool kids. Where as Landon was totally the opposite as he was one of the cool popular kids who would hang out with his friends after dark.Hard to imagine, but Landon finds himself dateless for the homecoming dance and as much as he doesn't really want to ask Jamie to go with him as he knows everyone will talk about him, but he figured it was better than not having a date at all. He held no feelings for Jamie what so ever, but that would all change after the dance and Landon would see Jamie in a totally different way. Unfortunately Landon would soon learn something that would turn his world upside down.A Walk to Remember is a beautiful love story which I enjoyed. Recommended.
