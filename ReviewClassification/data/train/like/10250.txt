This book will celebrate it's 50th anniversary next year so I'm glad I finally got round to reading it. It is a charming classic that has stood the test of time well, even though a great deal of good fantasy has been published since it first appeared. It's message that we should learn to lead our lives well is just as relevant today.The characters are quirky and funny. I loved the bumbling magician Schmendrick, who has yet to find his true magic as well as the hero Prince Lir, always off doing something heroic to impress the Unicorn, who remained disinterested and Molly Grue, the stoic, middle aged woman who accompanies the unicorn and the magician on the final stage of their journey. There are some great scenes, including the Midnight Carnival with all the enchanted creatures and the very real and creepy Harpy as well as the final confrontation with the fearsome Red Bull and the evil King Haggard. And of course the Unicorn is wonderful and beautiful, especially when she is herself.
