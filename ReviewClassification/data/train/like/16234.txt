A lot of people say that Sarah Dessen uses the same plot, the same idea of a teenage girl meeting a boy, who changes her life, with who she hangs out more and more and then there is a conflict (a lot of time happening because of her old life...), but the girl tries to explain...However, I LOVE her books and now that I think about it yes she does write her books the same way, but I LIKE that way.Along for the Ride is my favourite book. Its one of those books you can just read into and enjoy parts that you liked even after you read it.The book is about a girl called Auden. Her parents are divorced and she lives with her mom. The divorce effected her very much and so she fell into studying,learning...She never did anything social or enjoyed her childhood and now to think of it she almost skipped it.But that years summer, she goes to her Dad who lives in Colby with a women who he has a child from. Auden meets this guy called Eli, she doesnt even really know him, but they spend a lot of their nights together as they both stay up late (Auden because before the divorce her parents were up fighting late at night) making up for the stuff that she never did in her childhood. But then her Dad and the women fight, her dad moves out for a "break". This brings up a lot of Audens past and she is going back into studying, learning...that she hasnt done, mostly blocking out Eli. But then she realizes how much he means to her, but can Eli forgive her?I would definitely advice you to read this book! I loved Eli`s character the "we dont have to talk about it" if anything embarrassing came up.I also think that a lot of people can relate to the story.I just loved it :)
