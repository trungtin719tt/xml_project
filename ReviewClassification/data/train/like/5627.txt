This book starts out great! I love Grover.The problem is that Grover asks you to not turn any more pages, because of his belief that there is a monster at the end of the book. I decided to honor Grover's wish.Oh, I turned a few pages. But when Grover took the time to tie all the pages together to discourage me from turning any more, well, I just didn't have the heart to go on. The little guy was really scared.But I can't help but think.....are all monsters necessarily bad? You know it's funny - one could ALMOST consider Grover himself to be a type of monster.....Well, it's not for me to decide now. I chose to respect Grover's feelings.
