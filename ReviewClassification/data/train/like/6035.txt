This always shocks people, but I live under a rock and have never really had much to do with Sherlock Holmes. I've never watched it on television, never really read Doyle's works on the character or anything else along those lines. Finally I got around to readingThe Hound of the Baskervilles(actually the 5th in a series from what I've been told), and I'm really glad I did. This classic is like the epiphany of "London fog", capturing the scenery of the British city perfectly and giving readers an unforgettable hero who's very easy to relate to. Holmes has his flaws but he's a good detective, and he cares about what he does to the point where he's meticulously involved.
