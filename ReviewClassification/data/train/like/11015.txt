When I was young my parents took us to Gettysburg a few times and for some reason, I really fell in love with the landscape and the reverberating sense of history. Just walking in the fields and woods where these battles took place is a rather striking feeling and whenever I read this book, I am immediately and fully reminded of that feeling.Obviously, you might enjoy this book more if you are a battlefield/history nerd, but even just the human element is quite gripping, especially when you consider how carefully Shaara researched the people and events of this place and time.Each day of the battle is brought to full life with detailed accounts of the army's movements and how different soldiers played key roles in each turn of events. It's gripping because it's not just a point-by-point account but rather it is woven into one cohesive tale showing the passions of soldiers on both sides.A definite must-read for any civil war buff.
