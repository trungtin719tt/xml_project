4.5 stars"You know, Mitch, now that I'm dying, I've become much more interesting to people."While he was an undergrad, Mitchabsolutely lovedMorrie Schwartz's college courses - he took every class that professor taught.But, like most students, Mitch lost contact witheverything and anythingto do with his undergraduate years as soon as he graduated.That is...until he learns that his favorite professor doesn't have long left.ALS is like a lit candle: it melts your nerves and leaves your body a pile of wax.So, Mitch (on an impulse)decides to visit Morrie one last time...and that one last time turned into something else entirely.The class met on Tuesdays. It began after breakfast. The subject was The Meaning of Life. It was taught from experience.Over the course of a couple of months,Mitch reconnects with Morrieand in the process, learns the last great lesson from his college professor."Everyone knows they're going to die," he said again, "but nobody believes it. If we did, we would do things differently."Wow - what a book.The slow progression of the disease, combined with Morrie's calm demeanor and Mitch's grief just absolutelycinched this book for me.How can you argue with lines like this?Do I wither up and disappear, or do I make the best of my time left?or this?His philosophy was that death should not be embarrassing; he was not about to powder her nose.This book wasso refreshing, and sweet and beautiful.The author had such an amazing way with words. I cannot even begin to describe the feelings of peace that flowed through me.This should be on everyone's list.His voice dropped to a whisper. "I want someone to hear my story. Will you?"Blog|Instagram|Twitter
