I love books by Dr. Seuss in general, but The Lorax is definitely and by far my absolute favourite!Now, for any who have seen the film and not read the book yet, I should say that the book is slightly different, because the story is slightly shorter, which would not have worked for a movie.Nevertheless, or maybe exactly because of this, the book with its' magnificently cute drawings and wonderful rhymes is even more beautiful.A very important book to teach people (not just kids) about the importance of nature and the consequences of our actions!
