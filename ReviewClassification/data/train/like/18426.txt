First of all there is a whole lot going on in this novel. It is out if my usual preferred genre. I prefer to read about real people, with real problems. While this story is futuristic and science fiction it does deal with the century old questions of power, human relationships, and empathy for mankind. The setting takes place between Arizona and Northern Mexico. It prompted me to do a little research on the Ajo Mountains and salt mines as the author repeatedly referred to them. Matt, the protagonist is the type of character you want to root for since he has been given a bad lot in life. Created in a Petri dish and artificially inseminated and born of a cow solely to be used as parts later on to prolong the life of his original human, El Patron who lives to be 148 years old. There are so many moral questions that are raised by this story. Who should live? Who should die? Whose life is more important? Should poor people be destined to a life of slavery/servitude? Are their lives less important? What happens when the government makes bad decisions for the people in the name of the people? Who has the power to right the wrong? We will be using this with our inquiry unit to answer some of these questions. We will start the book in November in our Advanced ELA class.
