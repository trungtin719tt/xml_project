I thoroughly enjoyed this, the penultimate installment of the Inheritance Cycle, though it does sadden me to remember the end is near. Eragon's slow transformation from simple yet inquisitive farmboy to the last free Dragon Rider is a joy to read, and I relished every insignificant detail. Roran, who shocked me with his strength and fortitude in Eldest, continues on his path to becoming a brilliant military strategist and leader, all the while leaving his heart with his beloved Katrina. Murtagh... ah, Murtagh, my favorite tragic character doesn't get much time in the story (though a much larger part than in Eldest), but each line, each syllable is deliberate; my heart aches when he realizes there may be hope after all to release him from the binding magic placed upon him by Galbatorix. I am anxious to continue the relationship between Eragon and Arya; it started out as an akward sort of crush, leading to a dismissal by Arya, but I believe she has a newfound comraderie when it pertains to Eragon, especially toward the end of Brisingr, when Arya realizes what a great team she and Eragon make together. Will Eragon ever see his feelings for Arya reciprocated? Can Roran keep up this madman's pace with the Varden's troops before something tragic befalls him? Will Murtagh turn against the king, and how? Who will be the last Dragon Rider? And who is that strange hermit with the long beard living amongst elven ruins? It will be a long 2 years before I wil get my answers or hear Angela's biting comments, but well worth the wait. Thank you, Mr. Paolini, for leaving the book on such a beautiful note; one of subdued reverence, of the battles that lay before us, of hope, and of the inevitability of the end - maybe not the end of Eragon and his companions, but of our involvement in their lives.
