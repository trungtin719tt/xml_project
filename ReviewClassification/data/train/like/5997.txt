Pride and Prejudice (five stars)Persuasion (three stars)I enjoyed this one, perhaps because it wasn't quite as obvious how everything would play out (not the ending, but how it would get there). enjoyable!Emma (four stars)I really enjoyed this... I think I can connect to Emma the best out of all the Jane Austen heroines I've met so far, at least as far as personality, not necessarily matchmaking. And can understand things blowing up in your face and regretting decisions... seriously, who can't? Anyway. I think this might be my favorite so far. :)Sense and Sensibility (four stars)Mansfield Park (three stars)Northanger Abbey (three stars)Lady Susan (four stars)A little tricky at first, but I love the idea. And really fascinating characters. It made me think of perceptions... how we can view ourselves as better than we are, and how we are attracted to people who support our view of ourselves. (Lady Susan thought she was justified, and her friend agreed, etc.) A great view into how we function.
