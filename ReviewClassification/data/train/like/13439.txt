Fantastic! I won't be able to do this book justice in a review, but it really is one of the best I've ever read.The language is brilliant and makes you feel that you really are living on the moon. The Loonies are interesting and the plot kept me completely absorbed and desperate to hear what happened next throughout.One of the best revolutions I've ever had the pleasure to read. Highly recommended!
