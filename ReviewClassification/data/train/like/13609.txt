Read this review and more on my blogIn a nutshell:The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a magical and heartwarming read that anyone could enjoy.I put off reading this book for far too long. I've yet to see the movie adaptation but I've had my eye on this book for a while. Finally, I decided to borrow it from my local library and I loved it. Shortly after reading this, I also readWonderstruckby the same author, which was just as wonderful. It's been a few months since I read both but I can still remember how magical it was and how I fell in love with the story.The book is a chunky one at over 500 pages and it can seem daunting at first but it's actually a very quick read. A wonderful thing about this book is that the story is told through both writing and drawings. The writing style is a simple yet beautiful one, and it's easy to fly through the narrative. The majority of the book consists of illustrations that compliment the narrative beautifully. I love how they focus on particular things, by zooming in with each page, and how they take over from the narrative in various places to illustrate descriptions and events. There's overall a nice tone to the story and the breaks in the text work well. Individually, the book would have been great as a novel or graphic novel but with the two elements combined, it's fantastic.The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a simple yet magical story. There's all kinds of elements to it - it's an adventure/mystery story in a historical setting with a lovely bookish and magical feel to it. It's captivating and easy to read in one sitting. I fell in love with the characters and was enthralled by the story. The Invention of Hugo Cabret was a pleasure to read and I recommend it to everyone.
