Excellent!I can't believe I've waited so long to read this classic play! Having only surmised the story ofROMEO AND JULIETand not even seen the movie(yet)Inowknow Romeo was a Montague and Juliet a Capulet, two houses at odds. I know about the disastrous duels, the secret marriage, the surprise suitor and the botched plan; and then there's the fatal ending..... I even had that wrong, and OMGOSH they weresoyoung!I enjoyed actually reading Juliet's melodramatic expressions of love....."O Romeo Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?"and"Good-night, good-night! parting is such sweet sorrow....That I shall say good-night till it be morrow."But, IMHO, none were better than this one......"Give me my Romeo. And, when I shall dieTake him and cut him out in little stars,And he will make the face of heaven so fineThat all the world will be in love with nightAnd pay no worship to the garish sun."Bring on more Shakespeare! Unforgettable read!Update: March, 2016Oh Boy! Franco Zeffirelli's 1968 movie version of Romeo and Juliet is excellent! Just like reading the screenplay. Loved it!Thank you GR friends Sara, Lisa and Jonetta for the recommendation!
