Meticulous and endearing tribute to the crew of the B17 Flying Fortress, the Susan Ruth during World War II. Complied by letters and records left behind, author Steven Snyder, son of the pilot, Howard Synder, recounts the exploits of the crew from their family background, to training to the fiery crash that caused them to parachute and survive in enemy territory. In a clear and crisp voice, Synder describes both his father and the world he lived in. The budding romance with his mother, courtship and finally marriage is tenderly told through personal letters that paint a vivid picture of their relationship. Training, deployment to England and the grueling and dangerous conditions are described in harrowing details. This is how we should learn about war, through the eyes of those who sacrifice so much to keep others safe. The book tells of their insecurities and fears, the heartache from being away from loved ones, missing births and other milestones in the home front. I loved this band of brothers, their camaraderie and courage, and when I read the parts of the outcome, the unfair vagary of fate, I was saddened by the wastefulness of war. Heartbreaking and poignant, families and wives at home, showed equal bravery and support. This was a memoir, a love letter from son to father, honoring him for his quiet dignity and courage. It is a wonderful snapshot of people preforming admirably under the worst of conditions, where some gave everything they had to give.
