listen to this story.10 people in a private room with a big deal/money insurance company eating expensive steaks and drinking expensive wine. one guy says to the effect: "simple starches convert almost instantly to sugar, sugar actually makes you more hungry."so i say to the guy "so, evolutionarily we have develop to take advantage when we find food with alot of sugar. like hoarding."to which the gentleman, well dressed, presumably well paid, replies: "i don't believe in evolution."holy fuck. i go "oh." and walked off. but, i wonder does the man understand the methodological schema underlying his simple sugar makes you hungry assertion. no. no he does not.
