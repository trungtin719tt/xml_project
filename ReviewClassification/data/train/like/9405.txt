One of my high school teachers gave this to me when she was leaving to go to another high school. I was the girl who always was quiet so I had a teacher or two tell me that I wasn't going to get very far. But there were a few in the 11th and 12th grade who convinced me that I was more than my shyness. This book reminds me of that time and how far I've gotten since then from only saying 1 word a year to not being afraid of strangers. It always convinces me again that I am special. And on a plus note I really liked the drawings.
