Once again, Irving takes a plot full of outrageous twists and a bunch of odd characters and blends it all into a story that is at once ridiculous and everyday. He has the ability to describe, clearly but without drama, horrific or tragic events, and to explore the effects of those events on a character, but without making the whole story, or the whole character, about the event. He's an excellent story-teller, and his knack of oddity clicks very nicely with my love of the surreal.
