I know- I can't believe I'm just now reading this. What kind of a children's librarian am I?This is a nice little story about a family who smuggles some Jewish friends out of Denmark during the Nazi occupation in 1943. I always avoided reading this because it looked depressing, but it wasn't. It wasn't a light story, but it didn't have the horrible scenes that fill most holocaust books.However, the author's note at the end affected me deeply. I don't know a lot about my Danish heritage- I've always thought it was a sort of boring one. Most people I've known are descended from Danes, or some Scandinavian mix. Other than the Vikings, there's never seemed to be much of interest there. I've always envied my non-Scandinavian friends' more (in my mind) exotic backgrounds.I was amazed to read, though, of the courage and kindness of the Danes during WWII. The afterword spoke of the weeks in 1943 when the Danes smuggled almost their entire Jewish population out of Denmark- nearly 7000 people- to save them from the Nazi death camps. Astonishing. It makes me want to learn more about where I came from.
