Grades: pre-k to 2ndWhen I was in first grade, my sister and I found out we were adopted. I instantly sought comfort in this book. We were told we were adopted because in class we had to write down where we inherited our facial features and hair from. I couldn't say where I got my curly hair from and when my teacher told me I had to get curly hair from someone in my family, I came home from school on a mission to discover where it came from knowing that I was the only one with curls. The idea that I didn't look like the rest of my family, was difficult but this book helped me deal with my differences. Its been a long time since I read it, and although I believe the little lost bird ends up with a mother who looks just like him, I have this memory of my mom using this book to explain that a mother is more of a emotional connection, a caring relationship, not always a physical connection.
