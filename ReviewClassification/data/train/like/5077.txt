This was such a fun audio to listen to while at work today!Inkheartwas, again, a pretty interesting and entertaining audio book. Even though it did get little boring here and there the multiple POV's definitely saved me from being bored to death at work. Mo and Meggie were simple adorable. I loved their relationship so much. Plus being surrounded by all of those books sounds like a dream come true.One night, someone from her dad's past comes into their life. Dustfinger was a character that I couldn't fully trust. Mostly because he did some sketchy things or say sketchy things.. that just kept making me flip flop on him. Good for me, because the guy was working with the villain.. Capricorn. Unfortunately not good for me.. because I'm a damn Capricorn! Either way, Capricorn was a good villain and I really enjoyed him and his goons throughout the book.Now there was some mystery in this book because of what happened to Meggie's mom about 9 years ago. Then when she was introduced.. man I had no idea what this woman was going to do. I mean 9 years is a long time to be apart from your husband and kid. So naturally I was rooting for her to stay and be a family again.. but deep down I kept thinking she had this new life and she was going to go away.Overall, it was a good book. I loved that Brendan Fraiser was the narrator for the sneak peek chapter for the second book - I love that guy! Now I can't wait to dive into that audio!!
