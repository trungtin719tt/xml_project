This is one of the best kept secrets out there. This series is amazing and it's my favorite series after Harry Potter. It's surprising and twisting and you are just cheering by the end. Divergent and Hunger Games are great, but this is better. Check it outThis is about a magical creatures reserve run by an elder couple. Their grandkids have to come live with them in the summer and the fun is the kids discovering the magic surrounding them. Each step is wonderful and each book gets better and better. There are fairies all over the yard and the world and so this book is so dear to me. I love it.
