This was as much an existentialist tract as it was a book about the descent of a town into plague, the gradient of the decline increasing exponentially until they reach the pit. There it is death and smoke and groans and every bit the imagined hell of those with a religious consciousness.But the plague has no relationship to religion. The innocent die as much as the guilty. Shady people are sly by night, criminals escape justice, the great and the good die in their beds, the plague is the great equalizer. This is an atheist world where nothing has rhyme or reason and blaming it on fate or an angry deity or questioning why the deities have ignored the supplicants increasing praises, appeals and desperate petitions is futile. Even they see it is pointless and in the end the comforting rituals of death and consignment of the remains have mostly been abandoned. The plague strikes almost all and those whom it leaves, aren't special in any way.Pacing is not something I tend to notice in a novel, but I did in this one, it is outstanding. The pacing matches the descent in hell and the recovery into sunlight and a brisk sea air absolutely perfectly. At the end, after all the pain and darkness I felt relieved and refreshed, an unusual feeling for the end of a book.5 stars, golden ones.
