A treasured memory from childhood, I bought many Dr. Seuss books to read to my children when they were small.I discovered a surprising thing; I thought that I was well read and a literate adult..., reading these books out aloud requires great concentration and voice control (especially with a critical kid listening). However clever you may think you are, reading these books out aloud will improve your public speaking and help you to win friends and influence people :-)Go ahead, have some fun and improve your spoken delivery.I also recommend other Dr. Seuss Books including but not limited to :Dr. Seuss's Sleep Book, The Lorax, One Fish Two Fish, Green Eggs and Ham and I Had Trouble in Getting to Solla Sollew.
