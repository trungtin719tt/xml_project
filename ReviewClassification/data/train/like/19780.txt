I was adamantly opposed to reading a Historical fiction book. Just having the name historic in the genre turned me immediately off. After enduring months of constant badgering to give this book a shot by my sister in law, I caved and began the book. Not only did I fly through this book absorbing every vividly written detail, I was so caught up in the lives of the characters and the beautiful way that Francine Rivers illustrated God's unfailing love that I immediately went out and purchased the other 2 books in the series. Whether you enjoy Christian fiction or not, this book, and it's sequels, is a must read!
