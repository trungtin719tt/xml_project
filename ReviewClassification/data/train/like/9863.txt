4/5stars2019:second time reading it and still a great play! I always enjoy Shakespeare's comedies but this one seems to feel especially humorous to me2017:this was pretty great! I've never read this play by Shakespeare and I thoroughly enjoyed it for the hyjinks and craziness that happened! I loved the fact that thoroughout the majority of this play, since there were not very many female actresses in SP's time, there is a boy, dressing up as a girl, who is dressing up as a boy. Pretty funny stuff here, William. Also the lesbians. Also it was just really funny - I adore Shakespeare's comedy plays!
