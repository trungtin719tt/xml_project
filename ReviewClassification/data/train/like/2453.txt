I don't remember ever reading Dr. Suess (I'm sure I did, only it was SO long ago), so this just put me in such good spirits! I remember how giddy these made me feel, and the rhyming is just so whimsical, no books can compare to these. I'm collecting all of Dr. Suess's work and this was just such a classic, great place to start. I love the art and the story combined!
