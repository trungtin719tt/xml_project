This creepfest was absolutely rivetting.I don't know how I missed reading this when I was younger, but wowser, thanks to theMacHalo Crewfor putting it on my radar for taboo month!All the adults in this need to die in a fiery pit of doom. Self centered, pretentious and pious to a fault I want them all to die, die, die!This story is immensely readable, whilst being heartbreaking and horrible at the same time. Some of the things that happen in that attic.... Eeeep!My stomach was actually upset while reading this, I was nervous, I was afraid, I was shocked and I was horrified. I couldn't put it down.It was like a car crash. I knew what was coming, yet I could not look away.I fucking loved this, blood drinking, rat eating, incestuous relationship and all.Bring on the next one, I'm ready to be scarred some more.4love-it-came-unbiddenStars
