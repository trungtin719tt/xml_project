this was the first robbins i ever read. i loved this book. the story is ridiculously wonderful. his writing style is light and fast. this is easy and fun stuff.i do love how i was introduced to this book (and to the author). the summer before i moved to dc i was living in oklahoma city, living with my best friend and working for an environmental group going door to door collecting money and signatures. we usually traveled from okc to tulsa which also meant a mealon the road. one particular day this new guy was sitting watching all of us eat lunch. i asked why he wasn't eating, and he just mumbled something about not having any money. so, i bought him lunch. the next day, he brought me a copy of this book as thanks. i still have that copy...(i wish i could remember his name.)
