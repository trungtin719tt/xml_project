After reading the reviews here I'm glad to know I wasn't the only kid searching for a way into Narnia.I first read and fell in love with the series in the fourth grade. I read them over and over and over. Sometimes in series order, sometimes in chronological order. At some point I started saving them for Christmas break. I would read them every year at Christmas break. My family, all non-readers, thought this was a bizarre quirk of mine but they tolerated it.When the movie came out I took my family to see it...even my father who grumbled about going to a kids movie. They all fell in love with the story. They finally understood my childhood obsession.When my nephew reached fourth grade I bought the series for him. When my neice gets there she'll get her set too.Even as a child I was aware of the Christian symbolism associated with them. I really could care less. They are great stories on their own. I will read these books over and over my whole life through. They are fantastic, timeless classics.
