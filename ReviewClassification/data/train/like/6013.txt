I read Pride &amp; Predjudice. I've read it millions of times before, so of course I love it.I love everything about the tale- even the characters we are supposed to hate.Sometimes my pity for the Wickhams flip flops between Mr. Wickham and Lydia.This time I felt so sorry for Mr.Wickham to be stuck with such an insipid girl as Lydia.(Sometimes I feel sorry for Lydia that she is too stupid to realize that she will never make her husband happy short of falling into a lot of money.) I always feel a lot of pity for Mr.Bennett.To have a wife such as he has.I couldn't help but think him too lonely a man,him being surrounded by an all female household.And Mr.Collins.All that butt kissing for a free meal.Poor Charlotte. To have to put up with him.I think in the whole story that there are only two happy marriages.The rest just seem to be two people who just settled for what they could get-marrying according to station.The Wickham's is a marriage of delusion.Had divorce been a common practice,and views on age and marriage leaning more towards our point of views today,P&amp;P P would be a whole different story.
