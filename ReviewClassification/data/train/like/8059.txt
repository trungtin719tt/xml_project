take beside the fact that Zoey is definitely a (sorry) ho, P.C Cast had created a great book. I love that the story has something to do with legends and myths, really i found the idea with Kalona really impressing.And maybe because i am a teenager i just adore the easy-going writing style.Those are some plus points.Even if i gave the book 5 star rating that doesnt mean the book was flawless. I am 15 years old and i had a boyfriend, i know how it felt like to be between handsome men, but still i doubt Zoey is normal.My first impression:1. Zoey is a TOO nice girl2. Zoey is freakishly shallow3. Zoey is over hyperactive aggressive and has no women's pride4. Zoey has issue/hyper sex/whateverWhy cant she just break up the imprint with Heath? Why couldn't she think clearly before fooling around with Heath? Why Heath why? (I never like Heath)Obviously, i was very glad that Zoey may had something with Stark.Maybe the reason i gave untamed 5 star is because there were less love thingie, not like in Chosen (i thought i would puke because Zoey was definitely shallow).This book was totally focused on the real issue and i found it very pleasant. This is the best book of the other four.And please, please, Zoey must not be so perfect. Its too cliche. Zoey is the wrong hero. I like Aphrodite more, even the names too cheesy.Throw Zoey, and all her boyfriend to the trash bin then i would give untamed 7-star.sorry for stupid grammar and spelling mistakes, i am still learning.
