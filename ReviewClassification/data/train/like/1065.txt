I just cannot believe what I just read!Totally amazed me with the unusual illustrations!I haven't read a children's book with such kind of illustration depicting the wild imagination of a kid with such innocence.It is just suitable for very young kids.Less words.More pictures.The sequential art is the highlight of this one.But...I just felt it was too short. Just too short!
