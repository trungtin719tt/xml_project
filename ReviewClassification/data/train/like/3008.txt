A beautiful, calming bedtime story. A rabbit child is going to sleep, a grandmother rabbit watches and some kittens play on the rug by the fire. The story is safe, soporific and reassuring. I loved the funny details, like the bowl of mush and the saying goodnight to objects. This is an unusual mix of traditional style illustrations and crazy clashing colours.I borrowed this from openlibrary, an actual copy would probably be even more enjoyable.
