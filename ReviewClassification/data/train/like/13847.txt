Among the top five books I have ever read, and also one of the most important.A poignant and beautifully-told story that shares a painful struggle in Jewish history - one of the many that goes untalked about in modern history classes. This book should be mandatory reading in all highschools. Although it is a novel, it is completely framed in historical facts (I know because the stuff I read was so unbelievable, I had to look it up for myself to see if it was true - I even found publically-available UN documents and British-Mandate-period testimonies that verified the governmental meetings and other events Uris mentions).This is one of the few books in my life that made me cry almost every time I picked it up...to the point that after awhile, I just learned to grab the tissue box whenever I would pick up the book. It is heart-breaking to read what a hard time the Jewish people had. Even though Israel only takes up 1/10 of 1% of the land in the M.E., at least they finally have a nation of their own again, after centuries of persecution and slaughter that made the Jewish population there dwindle to almost nothing.The Jews painstakingly found their way back (well the Holocaust kind of left little choice since they had already been kicked out of so many countries) and some surviors who lost everything literally WALKED to Palestine from countries like Russia and Poland. And just like they always have, the Jewish people used their strength of mind and spirit to keep going, and once again made Israel into the beautiful nation it once was. They built it back up from almost nothing with (literally) their own blood, sweat and tears.This story of perseverance, hope, and what could almost be deemed a miracle is so moving and so inspiring you will feel like cheering at the end. Truly cathartic.
