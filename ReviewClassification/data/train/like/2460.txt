Well what would you do if your mother asked you?ME WHILE READING THISME AFTER READINGI swear I don't know why this made me laugh so freaking hard. I really don't. I mean the story was funny, the rhyming so fun, but it didn't warrant my hysterical outbursts. But I'm not surprised, I always find myself laughing inappropriately. For example;MY FRIEND SWEARS THE THINGS RYAN SAYS IN THESE GIFS ARE EITHER CUTE OR HOT. PHILLIPE FROM CRUEL INTENTIONS IS HOTMEOH STAHP.I'm seriously starting to think it's a disorder.But it did cross my mind,that the reason I find this funny is because I could relate to the story. Everyone can, I think. It reminded me of so many incidents during my childhood years when my mother would go out for a while, and I and my very spirited and fidgety brothers would turn the house into an amusement park. And then hours later when we realize our mother would be coming home anytime soon, enter us in flash mode trying to make reparations to fallen curtains, picking up everything we scattered around and chucking the rest into a cupboard whenever we ran out of cleaning time. I really liked this story, It's fun but a little bit sad that I'm only experiencing Dr. Seuss books now. I'm so going to read this to my kids someday.#Dr.Seussbookbinge
