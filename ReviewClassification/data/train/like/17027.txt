A fascinating read that both fed my appetite for information about WWI and whetted it for information about two countries I knew almost nothing about and the impact they've had on recent history. I was a little thrown at first by the personal nature of what I had initially pegged to be a straight biography of Gavrilo Princip, but once it got going, I was hooked. Part travelogue, part war history, and part biography of both the author and the subject, it's like no history book I've read before. The author's style is crisp but engaging. He teaches without lecturing, he philosophizes without sentimentalizing. By the end, I desperately wished I could have gone on this hike with him, but I was glad for the book that represents the next best thing.I'd recommend it to everyone who likes a good, intelligent history without being too formal about it. Think Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations, but less centered on food and a host less likely to offend or annoy.
