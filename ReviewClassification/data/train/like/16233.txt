Although it was not necessarily the ending I would have written, it was still a happy ending... just the way I like it. All the loose ends tied up in abig, red bow.Along for the Ride details the summertime adventures of Auden, a studious, sheltered girl who just graduated high school and decides to spend the summer with her dad, a narcissistic one-time author trying to finish his second novel, his much younger wife and their new baby in order to take a break from her emotionally aloof, highly-driven mother. Although the details of her life were unique to her, of course, I still found her story to be relatable."Maybe with normal mothers and daughters, it was more straightforward. They have the kind of back-and-forth that left no ambiguity or question, saying exactly what they meant when they meant it. But my mom and I weren't normal. So this, stilted and vague though it might be, was the closest we'd come to each other in ages. It was like reaching out for someone's hand, then missing their fingers or even their arm and hitting their shoulder instead. But no matter. You hang on tight anyway.""And the bottom line is, what defines you isn't how many times you crash, but the number of times you get back on the bike. As long as it's one more, you're all good."I loved this book for everything it was and everything it wasn't. Introspective, but not preachy. Innocent, but not immature. Real, but not pretentious. My only complaint--and this is just a personal thing--is that "Jesus" was used as kind of a curse word several times when "Jeez" (or something else just as innocuous) could have been easily substituted. I think this was noticeable because there was absolutely no cursing at all. None. If it was mixed in among other "language", it might not have stuck out so obviously to me. Just saying.
