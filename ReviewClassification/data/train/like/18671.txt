It's easy to love the book for both the story and the history. But I love it all the more for the characters (except for Calina, I must say I find her rather dull). My favorite is by far Petronius; the arbiter of elegance. He has the most interesting evolution throughout the book: he makes it very clear that he only cares about himself, his own pleasures, his well-being. He doesn't like to be bothered with anything that happens in the dirty world of the peasants. He only cares for Vinicius in the limits of his own comfort. He tries to help his nephew with the woman he loves the only way the Romans knew how: by force.Near the end though, he starts seeing other people as human beings, even though he refuses to live by Christian teachings and spread everyone with love. He even tries to help the persecuted Christians by unsuccessfully manipulating Nero. He shares Vinicius's suffering when Ligia is tortured in the arena. But even if he becomes more considerate of others, he won't quit his principles and he won't acquiesce to the Christian ways, not because he doesn't believe them to be true, but because he can't sacrifice the pleasures of life. He understands the Christians and their desire to redeem their souls, but he loves the decadence and the hedonism too much to give up the gods. Who cares about eternal life in Heaven when you're rich and you can have fun?"Truth lives somewhere so high that even the gods can't see it from Olympus."These are the words of Petronius, in his last letter to Vinicius. In the end, he chooses not to pursuit the truth and to limit himself to his life on earth. The bliss that comes from honoring the gods is, to him, far more important than finding peace in poverty, humility and love for all beings. Nearly everyone makes this choice every day, even if we call ourselves Christians. In Ancient Rome, being a Christian meant so much more than it does today. It wasn't just an abstract concept of religion, it was pure belief and a way of life.
