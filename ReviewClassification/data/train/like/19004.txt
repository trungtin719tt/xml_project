I really enjoyed the is book for the following reasons:1. I learned a lot about the bravery of the Belgian resistance. At times, my jaw dropped when I read about the incredible risks they took to save downed Allied airmen.2. The personal letters between the crew of the Susan Ruth and their loved ones back home brought the story to life.3. Finding and interviewing the German pilot who shot down the American B-17 demonstrates the author's enthusiasm for research.4. This isn't just a personal tribute to the author's father, but a serious attempt to explain the air war in Europe, from the American point of view.In his video interview on Goodreads, the author says he was trying to appeal both to military historians and the general public. I would say he has succeeded with flying colours!
