As many others were, I was deeply saddened when the first 12 chapters of Midnight Sun were illegally released on the internet, not only for the atrocity of the situation, but the hurt and depression that must have sweeped over Stephenie Meyer. When she posted the unfinished manuscipt for the fans, I sat up with my laptop and scrolled the PDF until I finished all 264 pages in one sitting. And what a sitting it was. I loved the Twilight series, and thought I knew Edward's character pretty well, loving him fervently, along with the majority of Meyer's fandom. After reading Midnight Sun I sat back, realizing I had only scratched the surface of Edward's psyche, and I had fallen in love with him all over again, but as if it were for the first time. I fully support Stephenie's decision to place an indefinite hold on finishing this novel - I can only imagine her state of mind after this ordeal and concur that it would not be the best for creativity (maybe morbidity, but nothing constructive). Ignore the obvious spelling and gramatical errors, for it was never meant to be released in this manner, and dive into the passionate world of Edward Cullen like you've never seen before.
