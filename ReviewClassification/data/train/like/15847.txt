It's a huge book - 548 pages - and takes a while to get into - with the Scottish brogue and all - but well worth it. I loved the characters - Renton and Sick Boy and Spud. Even though they do some terrible things, they have redeeming qualities that some of Irvine Welsh's characters do not. I had stopped reading Welsh novels for a while because I found them just too crass, but Skagboys reminded me why I love him.It's a long and meandering book - often you think it's going nowhere - but the detail and ordinariness of the lives prtrayed is hugely fascinating. I especially loved the diaries from rehab section. By the time I got to that part, I didn't want it to end!Looking forward to going back and re-reading Trainspotting now....
