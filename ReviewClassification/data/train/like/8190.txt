Wow, this book got some harsh reviews! I will agree that the whole southern friendship pact was over the top, but I think that Wells was trying to present a rare friendship and an outlandish character in Viviane. These girls grew up without air conditioning and television; they needed some pretty big distractions just to cope with the heat and the boredom!My mother in law grew up in Georgia, and remembers some pretty crazy characters from her youth and some wild stories in her own family. Having listened to her stories, I think the characters are plausible, and the storyline is very engaging. Yes, Viviane was a child abuser, horrifyingly so. But I didn't think Wells so much as justified her behavior as brought Sidda, Viv's daughter, to a place of understanding and forgiveness. Wells did a great job constructing events that led to Viv's alcoholism, abuse, and nervous breakdown. I thought Viv's months in the Catholic school were particularly well done.I stand by my initial rating; I really enjoyed this book.
