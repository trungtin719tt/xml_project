me and teen fiction are now irrevocably bound. what started as some kind of screamin jay hawkins voodoo spell and me helpless to resist has blossomed into something - a magical love like between a child and a vampire... okay, so i still refuse to read that one. but this series is just too good. it doesnt read like teen fiction at all. the characters are well drawn, there is great tension and imagination - i cant rate this highly enough. when i got to the end of the first one and saw "the end of book one" i got mad because i thought this would be one of those things that goes on forever and i have no desire for that kind of commitment. but now that i know it is going to be a trilogy and then stop, i am calmed. her other series (which i havent read) did something like 5 books and stopped, so i appreciate her understanding that when something is finished, it doesnt need to be milked forever. because with the teen market, they will keep buying them if they keep being written. i appreciate her restraint. but the book - i am actually excited to see how it all wraps up. i got this the day it came out, like some harry potter soccer mom, and now i have to wait (again) for the last part. maybe this will preserve my youthful glow. now i gotta go read an adult book, just so i know i still can...come to my blog!
