Another book scratched out of my top reading list..I already read quite a few of the author`s books and this was my last one of his. And was it just as funny as his other books?Yes, it was funny just asCharlie and the Chocolate FactoryandCharlie and the Glass Elevatorto me.I actually listened to the audio read by David Walliams. He did an excellent job, especially with the invented words that the BFG uses and the different characters of the story. It was wonderful done. He actually made the story even more hilarious by his narration.Overall, it's Roald Dahl's story, I mean he's an icon, right? He always has the most funniest, weirdest and wonderful magical stories.
