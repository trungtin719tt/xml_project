This was a very unexpected and enjoyable read for me. Yes, every character had at least one major flaw. Yes, these idiots in Salem made my blood pressure go up more and more with every act. That being said, I did enjoy the overall plot and drama of the play and now have newfound respect for the women and men affected by the Salem Witch Trials.
