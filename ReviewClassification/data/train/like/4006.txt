I read this book mostly in preparation for the 2017 film adaption, but I've always been curious aboutAgatha Christie. She's been recommended to me multiple different times over the course of my life, but I never felt the time was quite right to pick up one of her novels until now.The premise is very straightforward; master detective Hercule Poirot happens to be aboard the Orient Express rail car when one of the passengers is killed in the night. He is then set to the task of solving the crime while the train is excavated from a surprise snow drift.Because this is such a short mystery novel, I believe it's best to go in with as little outside knowledge as possible. In fact, there's only one thing I really want to focus on in this review and that is this.I did not guess the murderer.That is probably the biggest compliment a reviewer can pay to a mystery novel.I didn't even know what the hell was going on for most of this novel if I'm being perfectly honest.Now, call me an idiot if you feel so inclined, but I personally thought the mystery was very well written. Especially given that we discover clues in time with Hercule Poirot &amp; are limited to knowing only what he knows.The conclusion of this novel took it to a place I never would've conceptualized &amp; it was such a fun ride getting there.As for the rest, I recommend you pick this up and discover it for yourself. A very approachable murder mystery novel with a classic feel &amp; unique twist!
