More like a synopsis than a review. Lol. ^^The title of this book intrigued me and somehow demanded me to read the book. My intuition that I will not regret reading this book did not fail me because this book tells of an inspiring and touching story of a young girl, Melinda who lost herself, her confidence and her ability to speak after she was raped by the most popular senior a year ago.Because of her inability to speak, Melinda loses her best friend who thought that she was betrayed by Melinda during her best friend's party when Melinda called 911 but was unable to tell what really happened.For the whole year, Melinda lives her life in fear, silence and isolation, embarrassed of what happened to her. Even her own parents couldn't understand what she's going through.Her only hope lies on her art and on her art teacher, Mr. Freeman, the only person who seems to get her even just a bit. By allowing Melinda to express herself through art, Mr. Freeman sort of helped Melinda to learn to speak, really speak again until she finally finds her voice to speak out the truth that she was raped and that there is nothing to be ashamed of which also saved her best friend from the same ill fate (because her best friend was dating the rapist).Melinda starts getting back pieces of her life together and the story perfectly ends at Melinda's art class as she finishes her final requirement on which she earns an A+ and when Mr. Freeman asks her, "You've been through a lot, haven't you?," Melinda answers, "Let me tell you about it."
