Finally finished! I'm absolutely in love with this series! Took me a bit to read it but loved every second of it. Really loved the pace and execution of this story. JLA's MC are always awesome and interesting, plus the guys are to die for (I'm referring to Aiden btw ;). Seth is great....but Aiden is my favorite for some reason..Caleb is an awesome best friend and he's adorable!This story reminded me of Cassandra Clare's work, which I found really cool!Awesome and highly recommended read. Really can't wait to read the rest of this series.
