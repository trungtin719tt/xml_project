My last book of 2018!When you can't find a new book you feel like reading, why not pick up a book that's just over 200 years old?I can't tell you how many books I have read the blurb of in contemporary romances where it's a "second chance" romance where the guy or girl returns to the "home town" where they are unexpectedly reunited with the one person who broke their heart years before and then by the end of the book there is a HEA. And 200 years ago when this book was written, long before all those contemporary romance author's great grandmother's were even born, this book also followed that same basic romance path. However, the emotional tension found in these pages are a hard thing to find in books written in this century, where the stirring of feelings are replaced with a stirrings of the loins and secondary needless drama to fill out the book. Reading this novel I truly could put myself into the shoes of Anne who finds herself exasperated by her family and friends, wanting more, and not knowing if her romantic feelings are in any way returned. And then that letter! *swoon* Can we go back to a time where men wrote romantic letters instead of short texts with emoticons? I would still like to keep the modern amenities of hygiene, healthcare, and travel, for the record.
