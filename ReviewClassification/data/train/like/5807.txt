Maybe the best thing about Achebe's, Things Fall Apart, is that it give us a look at African culture from the inside, from their perspective, how they viewed the world around them and their place in it. Most of the African novels I've read give the outside view, the colonial or Christian view, which unfairly judges a people and a culture they couldn't possibly understand.The story is set in the Nigerian village of Umuofia in the late 1800's. Since their culture is based on history and tradition, things were probably much the same as they had been for centuries. So when the outsiders arrived, mostly white, mostly European, and in the beginning mostly Christian, the shock was unimaginable and, in many ways, catastrophic.The story revolves around the character Okonkwo, who dominates the narrative to the extent the book could have been titled Okonkwo. Dominate is the right word because that's Okonkwo's way. In village life, with his wives and children, he rules with an iron will. And when the "white man" shows up in the village, you knew that Okonkwo would be the wall of resistance.If you are interested in African culture, historical fiction, good writing, well here is your book. 4.5 stars.
