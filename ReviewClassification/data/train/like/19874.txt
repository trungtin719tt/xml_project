While the second of James Herriot's (or more to the point Alfred Wight's) semi-biographical veterniarian memoir omninbusses, while hisAll Things Bright and Beautiful(which contains the also singly released novelsLet Sleeping Vets LieandVet in Harness) migh very well be considered a trife more episodic and anecdotal thanAll Creatures Great and Small(than the author's first omnibus), it is generally and for the most part as entertaining, as evocative and yes, as enlightening a reading experience (although I guess that I would have indeed both liked and also appreciated a bit more information about Helen, about James Herriot's wife, than that she obviously tends to much spoil her new husband with comfort, with food, with always catering to both his needs and desires, even his eccentricities and peculiarities).And although when I first readAll Things Bright and Beautifulin 1986 (as an appreciated comfort break from required German literature readings during my second undegraduate year), my favourite episodes tended to generally be the anecdotes introducing and featuring Granville Bennett (both Herriot's meticulously detailed, entertaining description of the latter's character and modes of deportmemt, his immense skills as a small animal veterniarian and yes how Granville Bennett, whenever the two meet professionally, seems to get James Herriot absolutely and roaring drunk), what I have found the most enlightening and of personal interest during my most recent reread are the featured stories demonstrating how the introduction of new types of medications (in this case the so-called sulpha drugs) quickly and at that time (during the late 1930s and early 1940s) often seemingly overnight were able to cure bacterial infections in animals that used to be the knell of doom for farmers etc. (and for their livestock, for their animals as well, naturally). But of course, as James Herriot so astutely points out in his anecdotes, the orignal almost miraculous appearing cures did not last, as what he and his colleagues, including physicians, were witnessing was the impact of brand new, bacteria-destroying medications on populations of microbes with absolutely no restistance (and in time, the bacteria, the microbes have by necessity fought back, have produced more and more successful resistances to prescribed, used medications, with the overuse and misuse of sulpha drugs and later antibiotics also creating increasingly serious problems with drug tolerant strains).A winning and delighful combination of humor and pathos, of triumph and tragedy isAll Things Bright and Beautiful(and I certainly and unashamedly did cry when retired work horse Old Badger died due to a preventable tetanus infection, because the blacksmith had drained pus from his hoof without calling the vet to also give him an anti-tetanus shot). But for me, personally, the fact that James Herriot always strives for a sense of balance in and with his memoirs is really and truly what have made these not just enjoyable reads but also total and everlasting favourites (as the entertainment provided byAll Things Bright and Beautifuland the described and depicted physical beauty of the Yorkshire Dales are framed with and by important lessons on not only the joys but also the many problems, the potential tragedies of farming, of animal husbandry for both the farmers and also for the veterinarians treating the latter's stock, being responsible for farm animals' wellbeing, but sometimes and even rather too often not really being able to successfully cure many of the animal diseases that occur, that manifest themselves).
