This was my Bible version from my teens until mid 20's and is therefore covered in colourful stickers and scrawled writing. It provides a good middle ground between versions likeNew American Standard Version(NASB) andEnglish Standard Version(ESV) and versions likeThe MessageandThe Good News Bibleor evenThe Street Bible.The former options are more accurate to the original text so I switched to NASB some years ago, however, if I'm struggling to concentrate I sometimes return to my trusty NIV which makes for simpler reading. I do not agree with those who dismiss it as a paraphrase. However, I would caution those adults who use the latter versions (The Messageetc) as their primary devotional Bible.I am wary of making too much of Bible versions being aware that there are those who subscribe toKing James Versiononly and who think that other versions are somehow irreverent or misleading. Some have become so focused on this as to lose perspective about what is important.My own view is that we should all be reading the most accurate translation that wecan understand and apply to our lives.What is the point in persevering with a dated text using words that are no longer familiar when we have more modern translations that are accurate that we can understand more easily?
