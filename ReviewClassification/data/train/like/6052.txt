I really shouldn't like this book as much as I do. A historical romance? Come on.Frazier's prose is in the tradition of that poetic backwoods style that you might find in some Faulkner or in the films of Terrence Malick and David Gordon Green. Definitely the product of a learned man trying to sound like he's from the sticks, equal parts Old Testament fire-and-brimstone and rootsy colloquialism. His story is ambitious in its attempts to convey feelings of the grandeur of America, smouldering passions that impossible distances can't dull, and the world-weariness felt by every generation as soon as it realized the scope of evil in humanity. And, honestly, he pulls it off.Yes, this is kind of crowd-pleasing fiction, but it's one of the best things to wind up on any kind of bestseller list in recent years. Sometimes you need to read something like this. Maybe.
