This book was very good but much sadder and action packed than the first one. I had some time in between so there is going to be a full long review. I'd had to say that there were much more action. It might have been because I understood the human better than the bad aliens that they were fighting in the first book. Katy is determined to not love Daemon despite their connection. Daemon feels the same way. Katy then meets a new boy at school who understands Katy's condition and problem. Blake starts to train her and this makes the rift between Katy and Daemon even wider. Despite this, the search for Dawson, Daemon's brother, is continued. Toward the end of the book, many known and unknown mysteries are solved and truths are revealed. In this book, Katy develops her powers and uses in them in new ways. There are more arguments and feelings shared between Daemon and Katy which show both their personalities and their feelings for one another. There is a cliff hanger at the end of the book dealing with the situation of a character.
