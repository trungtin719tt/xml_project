This book is awesome. And, like many others who have reviewed it, I didn't read it all the way through the first time I tried to read it. This book is LONG. And it DRAGS. I don't know why, but Clive Barker loves to drag. I think I finished it my third time or so and that's only because I really wanted to see what happened.I have to admit, I hated it at first. It was so slow and boring and skipped around so much that I just didn't want to deal with it, I wanted to read something easier. I'd retain random tidbits and even when I did finally read it all the way through I'm sure I missed lots of details because it's just so long and wordy.It's a wonderful story and concept and I'm always in awe of what Clive Barker's imagination has to offer. That guy is weird, but I love him, I'd love to meet him. The only reason this book got 4 stars instead of 5 is because it is so slow-paced. Clive Barker is an AMAZING writer but this story would've been better suited for a trilogy or something.One day I'm going to re-read this book! I highly recommend it to anyone who's a fan of weird things and fantasy novels as well as flowery prose and abnormal sex. If you can't handle any of the above, don't read it!
