I loved rereading this! It's been a long, long time since I read this when I was a child and it was great returning to the world of the 12-year-old Artemis Fowl - a child genius and criminal mastermind - who has decided to make the fairy world fall down at his feet and give up their gold so he can rebuild his family fortune.I had forgotten a lot of the details about this story so for most of the book it was like reading it for the first time, and gradually in a great way the memories came back to me like how great Butler is and the hilariousness that is Mulch. I have always really loved Holly Short, the fairy that Fowl captures to catapult his plan into action, and secretly always fantasised about playing her in a film version, and this book just helped remind me of all the ways she is great.This book had me laughing, gasping, reminiscing and was a plain old good time and I'm SO GLAD I decided to reread it!!
