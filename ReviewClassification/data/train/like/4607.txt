One of those seminal touchstones from my childhood that I still connect with today. Anytime I read this it automatically makes me happy!!! This series had a lot of influence on me, in various ways (it took me many years to realize this btw). I love the art, wit, humor, devious wryness, cultural critique, imagination, humanism slyly mixed with cynicism, the whimsy. Watterson merges a beautifully skilled visual style with brilliant comedic timing and writing. Apogee of the comic strip here imo. An incredible 10 year run, and he could have kept it going for much much longer but didn't want to grind the thing to dust and become repetitive plus I think Watterson got super sick of dealing with the constraints of newspapers and the increasing shackles and marginalization of comics in that medium...And on a side note I find it fascinating to contrast the careers of Watterson and Charles Schultz. Great talents, interesting to compare the creative decisions/evolutions in their work but also the business/financial/brand decisions. Not necessarily saying either is right or wrong but the juxtaposition showcases some of the dilemmas and choices that face creators (especially issues facing comic artists of that particular era but certain issues still hold true today).
