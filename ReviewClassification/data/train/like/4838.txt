Wow! What a gruesomely disturbing ride Mr King! I must admit, I watched Misery years ago, and I remember not thinking much of it, as it didn't really make me squeamish. In the case of "Misery" I think the book was better, and it took the term "Fucked up" to a new height.Although this was a great read, I found I didn't love this as much as Pet Sematary, but it was still classic King writing, and it kept me pretty unsettled, until the very end.And, talking of unsettled, lets talk about Annie Wilkes. What a woman! She is probably one of the most disturbingly crazy female characters in fiction. I find her layered, and by that I mean that she's a real mixed bag. You really never know what you're going to get. I cannot say I LIKE her character, because, lets face it, she's pretty evil, but she is interesting. The way she lives her life for one. She doesn't fit in to society, so she distanced herself from it on her little farm with her animals- until she met Paul Sheldon. And that is when shit hits the fan, and we learn, incredibly quickly actually, that nobody fucks with Annie Wilkes.I found myself rather on edge with this, eager to know what stunt Annie might pull next, especially if Paul made her angry. There was one scene, and I found myself thinking " Wow, he's not seriously written THAT, has he?" Obviously, the answer to that, was a yes. It's King. There is nothing he won't write about, especially when his words are able to crawl into the very depths of your mind, and set up home there for a while. This was another grand novel from King, and I'm itching to read my next!
