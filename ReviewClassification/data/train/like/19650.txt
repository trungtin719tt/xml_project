When someone asks me what "Imajica" is about, I always find it difficult to explain. It's a complicated book, but very readable, and it's got a plot, but one that isn't terribly easy to describe.I suppose, in short, it's the story of a man who discovers four worlds linked to, but separated from, Earth, and how he goes about traveling through these worlds in order to discover the secrets of his own past, a past mysterious even to himself.And that's really not a very good summary. It's hard to describe. This book, more than any other, causes me to sit back and really think upon it, throughout the duration of the reading (and it usually takes me about three weeks to finish), and at the end, when I've had a chance to digest the weight of the material in this, Clive Barker's best novel, and in my opinion, crowning achievement. I love his recent, and also epic, "Abarat" series, but it doesn't move me the way this story does.After my recent fourth reading of this book, my opinion of it is the same as when I first picked it up, years ago. There are moments of extreme horror and violence which contrast with pages of wonder and genuine, non-terrifying excitement. The sex is graphic, but with nothing quite so twisted as the woman-dog coupling in "The Great and Secret Show," and is genuinely erotic. The characters, from the protagonist, John Furie Zacharias (also known as Gentle), to his longtime lover, Judith, and his new companion, Pie, are fully developed, conflicted, imperfect beings. The villains, including one of Barker's best, a creature called Dowd, are top of the line, and there are moments of real dread in this book.I can't recommend this book enough, particularly for fans of fantasy and the supernatural, who don't mind a bit of extreme bloodshed here and there.
