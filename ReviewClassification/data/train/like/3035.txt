Has nobody read this book? All these years and we are still chopping down trees, creating loads of pollution and happily killing off animals.This has to be Dr. Seuss's most serious book, he tones down the silliness and tries to get across his warning. The illustrations are wonderful, the start is so bleak and drab, all shades of grey and once the story gets told the colours are so vivid they jump out of the page at you, only for you to watch the grey come back as the trees get cut down.Wonderful story telling with a powerful message.
