Chocolat was exactly the kind of novel I needed at the moment. I discarded books left and right, I was in the mood for something literary and after re-watching the movie - I settled on this one. I decided to savor it as one would a piece of chocolate, slowly, letting it melt into my mouth so that I could absorb the flavor better.The book is similar to the movie and yet very different - surprisingly I like both in their own way. It was a beautiful novel, full of magic, luscious descriptions of chocolate and other confections, and human relationships. It was hard to remember that this novel is set in modern times and not back in the day. I think I prefer the movie villain as the book's villain is a bit too typical. Father Francis is everything I despise about the church and the reason I no longer go, a man convinced of his own piety and holiness while blaming everyone for their sins without actually attempting to save them. I especially can't forgive him for Josephine. The bastard knew what her husband did to her and yet he still pleaded for her to go back to him, until the husband shows his colors in public. How's leaving your extremely abusive husband breaking the sanctity of marriage, but beating your wife acceptable? And of course, everyone in town knows and no one does anything until it's almost too late. Sanctimonious assholes.The novel ends on a bittersweet note and yet there is a promise of good things to come. And now I'm curious to read the next novel.
