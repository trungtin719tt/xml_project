Twain takes a hard-hitting look at the dark, seamy underbelly of an American childhood.Who'd a thunk that this small Missouri town could be such a horrifying place to spend one's formative years?So much ignorance and superstition . . ."You got to go all by yourself, to the middle of the woods, where you know there's a spunk-water stump, and just as it's midnight you back up against the stump and jam your hand in and say:'Barley-corn, Barley-corn, injun-meal shorts,Spunk-water, spunk-water, swaller these warts,'and then walk away quick, eleven steps, with your eyes shut, and then turn around three times and walk home without speaking to anybody."Children fighting right in the streets . . .In an instant both boys were rolling and tumbling in the dirt, gripped together like cats; and for the space of a minute they tugged and tore at each other's hair and clothes, punched and scratched each other's noses, and covered themselves with dust and glory.Corporal punishment . . .The schoolmaster, always severe, grew severer and more exacting than ever, for he wanted the school to make a good showing on "Examination" day. His rod and his ferule were seldom idle now -- at least among the smaller pupils. Only the biggest boys, and young ladies of eighteen and twenty, escaped lashing.Rampant nudity . . .After breakfast they went whooping and prancing out on the bar, and chased each other round and round, shedding clothes as they went, until they were naked . . .Failure to report a felony . . .And even sexual harassment . . .Tom clasped her about her neck and pleaded:"Now, Becky, it's all done -- all over but the kiss. Don't you be afraid of that -- it ain't anything at all. Please, Becky." And he tugged at her apron and the hands.(#BeckyThatcher #MeToo)Yikes! What a scary world they lived in back then. Kids today have it so much easier, don't they?
