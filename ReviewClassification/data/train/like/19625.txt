This book helped me to escape from myself.2016 and 2017 were tough years for me. I was always generally healthy, which didn't serve me well when my body and mind seemed to break apart gradually but ever so steadily. I didn't know how to take care of myself. And when I finally managed to learn, I became obsessed. It became a different kind of unhealthy. I needed to let my mind run far elsewhere, but fear kept drawing me back.. until I picked up The Thief Lord (and Harry Potter again &lt;3)This book follows two orphaned brothers, Prosper and Bo, who ran away to Venice, the enchanted land that their mother spoke about in her night time stories, in order to stay together. Here, they join a gang of runaway children - the mysterious Thief Lord as their leader. I enjoyed every single character of this story so So SO much. Even the antagonists were unique and I loved how Cornelia Funke carried them through until the end. And because it's quite a short book, I couldn't get deep back stories from all of them, but they each made a strong impression to fuel my imagination. One expectation that did not get met was my assumption of a lot more magical elements. You do definitely get some magic for sure though, just got to be patient ;)I highly recommend this book if you're a youngster who would like to grow up faster or an adult who would like to return to your childhood. It will take you on such a trip. Venice can do that!
