If I could give this book ten stars, I would. In fact, it makes me rethink all of the other books that I've given five stars, perhaps they don't deserve it...Here's the problem: This book isn't going to have the right impact unless you've read, at the very least, three of the previous Ankh-Morpork Night Watch books. Please, if you have heard about Pratchett and are looking for some place to start, go with "Guards Guards!" or "Mort", and read a few more before you embark on this one. You'll thank me later.Thanks to time travel, we get to go back in time and see many of our favorite Ankh-Morpork characters in the tail end of the bad old days that many would like to forget. And it's no wonder - Ankh-Morpork is ruled by a fascist Patrician who had imposed a city-wide curfew, and, due to his paranoia, is having his "Unmentionables" round up anyone who might be a dissident and torturing them into giving information. Vimes chased a totally Bursar criminal with no morals onto the roof of the Unseen University Library, and through a freak electrical storm, winds up back in the days when he himself was a rookie in the AM Night Watch. The criminal, Carcer, killed the man who Vimes remembered from the time as being his role model, John Keel, leaving Vimes to step into his place and try to guide the events of the Glorious Twenty-Fifth of May to their necessary conclusion. But could Vimes change the path of history this time and spare the lives of a few good men? Or is history doomed to repeat itself?This is my favorite Discworld novel, and that is an incredibly hard title to come by. I find it to be incredibly moving and emotional, and it makes me cry every time. "All the little angels rise up, rise up..."
