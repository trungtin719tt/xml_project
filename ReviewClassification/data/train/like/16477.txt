Are you a cat or a dog person?If you answered cat, this book is for you!It follows the adventures of a house cat who escapes into the woods and joins a tribe a fierce wild cats who regularly engage in battles for more hunting territory.The plot has a lot about nobility and it is easy to see parallels between this story and classic stories of knights and squires such as The Knights of the Round Table.As an English teacher, I have several students who love this book and the entire series it is a part of. It is a fun and fast paced read and I would recommend it to those who are looking for a easy to read, breeze of a story.
