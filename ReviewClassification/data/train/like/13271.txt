"You need your sleep. Roughing it out isn't going to impress anyone. It's just stupid."Ah, Derek. Always so encouraging.The sarcasm is real with this one. ;DI told myself Simon was wrong. I'd never be dumb enough to fall for Derek. But I had. With him so close, my stomach kept doing weird little flips. It wasn't fear. It hadn't been fear for a while.I wasn't horrified and disgusted. What I saw wasn't some guy puking and grotesquely contorting. I saw Derek, in unbelievable agony and scared out of his mind.He smiled, hesitant at first, then a blazing grin broke through that made my heart stop. I recovered and grinned bad and went to throw my arms around his neck, then stopped, blushing. Before I could pull back, he caught my elbows and put my arms around his neck and pulled me into a hug.Okay guys. I'll admit to you that yes, since I first read this books about 3 years ago I've had a crush on Derek. There I admitted it! Are you happy now?!?! He's been my number 1 book boyfriend and I love him. Don't judge me. ;)I loved this series. It will always be my all time favourite! If I had to get rid of all 300 and something of my book and just keep this one, I would. &lt;3"Fight," I whispered, and it was all I needed to say.Read- September 2015 5 starsRe read- January 2017 5 stars
