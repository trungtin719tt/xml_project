With over 200,000 reviews on this modern classic I'm thinking a rating should suffice but will add my thoughts. Growing up during the same time period in which it is set, much was personally relevant about the times recounted in these pages.A bitter-sweet, brilliant, laugh out loud, tragic tale about an epic friendship, beginning in the 1950s and into the Vietnam War era. From my viewpoint too long-winded in sections, yet so worth the ride. It requires patience from the reader as we follow them through their decades of love and loss on a miraculous journey to where the great unknown calls them. But when it was all said and done, I loved most of it. Best savored and appreciated at a slow and thoughtful reading pace. If you were here with me now, you would see the tracks of my tears. Should I live long enough, I will read it again someday.
