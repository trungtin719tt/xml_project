This book has been one of the most influential in my life. Camus uses the premise of a town infected by the plague and quarantined from the rest of the world to explore some of the great philosophical questions. I find his exploration of religion very astute--that God is either not able to prevent evil and is thus not omnipotent or that God is all powerful and thus condones evil. Either option to Camus is a God not worthy of worship.Many people read The Stranger and think Camus is a pessimist, that he has taken the thought experiment that everything is absurd to the extreme and believes in nothing. The Plague was written after The Stranger and is a shining example of how optimistic Camus really was. He may not believe in God or higher meaning but he and his characters cannot deny their love for humanity, nature and the need to help others. The scene of the two friends swimming still sticks in my mind as the perfect example of this.Overall, this book has meant a lot to me and it may resonate with others searching for a philosophy that is not derived from religion or dogmas. It is a powerful story with plenty of things to keep you thinking long past the last page.
