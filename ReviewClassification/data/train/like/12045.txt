"I think when you fall in love, like true love, it's love for life. All the rest is just experience and delusions."What an AMAZING, BEAUTIFUL story!!!I have to say, when I started readingThe Edge of Nevermy expectations were high, VERY HIGH...So when the first part started out a bit slow I was beginning to question if I would really find it as good as everyone else... But in the end it completely met up to my expectations and I ABSOLUTELY LOVED it...When we first meet the twenty-year-old Camryn Bennett, she's just been through a very rough period. Not sure what to do with her life, she decides to run away from home and to breek free from the everyday life she's leading.."So often I sit around and think about life and wonder about every possible aspect of it. I wonder what the hell I'm doing here. Yesterday I thought about why I felt the need to get up at exactly the same time as the day before. Why? What compels any of us to do the things we do when deep down a part of us just wants to break free from it all?"So Camryn decides to take a bus to anywhere, just to get away from it all. And on that bus is where she meets Andrew Parrish. A tall guy with stylish, short brown hair, green eyes, TATTOOS and most importantly an incredible sense of humor (his inner monologues really made me laugh-out-loud sometimes!) Oh and he also plays the guitar! (What's not to like, right?). Together they decide to take a journey on the road to nowhere. But really, what they do, is take a journey on the road to everywhere... Along that journey they teach eachother about life, love, friendship and about so much more."I was taking the long road and Camryn was taking the road to nowhere and it just so happens that they led to the same place."While reading this book I laughed, I cried and I sighed over how wonderful a guy Andrew really is. I went through all the emotions Camryn and Andrew went through and I enjoyed every second of it. It was a remarkable journey, one that I would advice anyone to go through. So to everyone who hasn't read it yet, I would say:TAKE A SEAT, BUCKLE UP AND JOIN CAMRYN AND ANDREW ON THEIR JOURNEY THROUGH LIFE !!!(and grab a box of tissues while you're ahead because you're going to need them...)What this book thaught me is to not dwell on the past and to live life to the fullest because you never know what the next day might bring."Dwelling and planning is bullshit. You dwell on the past, you can't move forward. Spend too much time planning for the future and you just push yourself backwards, or you stay stagnant in the same place all your life. Live in the moment where everything is just right, take your time and limit the bad memories and you'll get wherever it is you're going a lot faster and with less bumps in the road along the way."I definitely loved reading this book and I hope everyone else enjoys it as well!!!Some more pictures that remind me of Camryn and Andrew and their amazing journey:Camryn and AndrewAndrewHis guitarTheir loveFavorite quotes:"The heart always wins out over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets its way.""If you were to let me fuck you, you would have to let me own you.""A woman who knows what she wants sexually, and isn't afraid to express it is so fucking hot, Camryn- Tell. Me. What. You. Want. Or, I won't give it to you.""Just because one person's problem is less traumatic than another's doesn't mean they're required to hurt less.""Two people unable to cry finally cry together and if the world ended today, we would be fulfilled."5 BRILLIANT STARS!!!!
