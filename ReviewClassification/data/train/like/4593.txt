When I decided to readThe Green Mile, I was absolutely, positively 100% sure it wouldnevermeasure up to the movie, and was Ieverwrong.Allof the characters(including Mr. Jingles)are so well drawn that you feel like you are experiencing their lives and feelings right along with them in Cold Mountain State Penitentiary-1932.If I could rate this magical, unforgettable(rip your heart out)story more than 5 Stars, I would not hesitate to do so. What else can I say except......."Time takes it all, whether you want it to or not".
