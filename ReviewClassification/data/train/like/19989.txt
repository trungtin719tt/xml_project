This is some of the best writing I've read on the sentence/paragraph level. I wasn't particularly concerned with where things were going plotwise at first because it was such a pleasure to read Robbins's prose, but I eventually found myself drawn into the story too.This book is silly, clever, thoughtful, endearing, sweet, dirty, poignant, thought-provoking, funny, pithy, punny and charming, etc. The feminism made me proud to be a woman without turning me against men. Robbins is critical and philosophical without being unkind or cynical. [spoiler alert, sort of] I thought he was proselytizing a bit much in the middle, but by the time I got to the end I realized he was just chewing on a lot of ideas, and that his ultimate conclusion was that each of us will have to decide for ourselves how to deal with the many truths and belief systems out there, and that we probably won't ever get it quite right, but the point is to keep chewing.Super enjoyable read, as long as you can tolerate none of it making any sense. ;-)
