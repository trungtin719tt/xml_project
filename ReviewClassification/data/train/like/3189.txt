I really enjoyed the author's very original take on this famous legend. Having Morgaine as a sympathetic character instead of the usual villain of the piece I thought worked very well. Only four stars from me though because I felt the story faltered many times especially with the constant repetitive bickering between characters about Christianity versus paganism. Obviously this was central to the book but there was just too much. And Gwenhwyfar was just awful. I have never had much sympathy for her when the story is told more traditionally but in this I just wanted to smack her! So overall an enjoyable version of the legend, well told with some great highlights but a little repetitive and consequently too long.
