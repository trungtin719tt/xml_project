The first 600 pages of this book are a gripping read. Tartt creates sympathetic protagonists that you want to root for and fast-paced adventures and predicaments in which you want to see them succeed.Tartt owes a great debt to Dickens in the story's plot, characters, and pathos. Theo Decker is shockingly and suddenly orphaned one ordinary day after a bomb rips through the Metropolitan Museum and his mother perishes while admiring her favorite paintings. Of course, she was beautiful, smart, and possessed of a heart of gold. His father, on the other hand, is a charming con artist who has abandoned them to live with another woman in Las Vegas. Theo has high and low adventures (hopscotching from a tony apartment on the Upper East Side with the blue-blooded Barbours to a seedy desert neighborhood in Las Vegas after his father shows up to reclaim him).Tartt is adept at creating vivid scenes and landscapes (her descriptions of Las Vegas' arid beauty are gorgeous), but she has a tendency to fall back on familiar (and sometimes, cliched) stereotypes. Of course, the Barbours are troubled in that particularly WASP-y, repressed way. Of course, his new Russian pal, Boris, reads Dostoevsky and cynically pontificates on life and politics while waving his arms about and drinking vodka. And of course, his eventual savior and guardian, Hobie, comes with an alluring ward who will forever haunt him and claim his love, a la Estella in Great Expectations.I really enjoyed the first 600 pages of the novel. I thought Tartt revealed a lot about modern America and what it means to be successful (or striving) in America today as she unfurled the brisk plot. However, the last 100-150 pages, with its metaphysical and existential pontificating, did little to advance the plot and ultimately caused me to become less invested in the book and its characters. That is unfortunate, since I was rooting for Theo, Boris, and Pippa right up until the very end.
