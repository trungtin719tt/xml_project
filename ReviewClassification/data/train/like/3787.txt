If Harry Potter series were considered heretic by some groups of people, I don't know what will they say when they read Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials as the books do reflect anti-Christianism with God portrayed as vindictive and authoritarian figure growing ..dare I say it? ...senile and need to be ousted (Oh my God)..His Dark Materials is a trilogy beginning with the shocking The Golden Compass, and followed by The Subtle Knife and ends with The Amber Spyglass. And if we disregard the anti-christian feeling, it's a fast paced and fantastically imaginative fantasy story.The heroine is Lyria partnered with a young boy as the solid companion - where they battle dark angels, facing encounters with the talking polar bears and brave many near death experiences in their quest to save the world from Armageddon.It's interesting to read the metaphors and philosophies in the books - in Lyria's world, everyone has "daemons" or in our world "souls" which resemble animals and keep changing until a person reach adolescence and losing one's "daemons" is a catastrophy. Very much like losing one's soul I guess where a person is like losing his essence or being.Then the battle of good and evil and the shaking of our belief of what has always been considered good may not necessarily be good.His Dark Materials delight and entertain as a fantasy novel even though there are some parts which I think wander too much out of the story...however, regardless all that - it's an interesting read.
