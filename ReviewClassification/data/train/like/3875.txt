I've just finished this book and half a box of hankies. Of course we know how it ends, but who has ever explained how it began? To enter the possibly true heart of real people in a setting the New Testament barely hints at, is fascinating and eye-opening. A wonderful book, wonderfully observed, and beautifully written. A slow boiling classic. I think this book is going to stick around.
