This book is perfect for your 2-4 year old. It gives your child permission to disobey important instructions from cute, loveable Grover (who could whoop Elmo in a Sesame street fight).The book grabs your attention from the very first line, with Grover teasing your child's curiosity about a potential monster at the end of the book, all the while begging your child NOT to turn the page. And yet we encourage the child to do it anyway.This "cute-for-now" moment will be stored in your child's memory and, eventually, come back to haunt you when you tell the child NOT to do something and they do it anyway; all the while giggling about how much fun it is to rebel against orders and society as a whole. And can you blame them? After all, you created the monster, and here's a newsflash...it's not at the end of this book, it's in the bathroom making its fourth attempt to flush a sock down the toilet after you told them not to.Enjoy!
