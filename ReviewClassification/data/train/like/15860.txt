Junot Diaz has created a masterpiece here, an incredible tribute to Dominican culture and history, and let's face it. . . what in the hell did you know about Dominican anything before you read this book?Nada. Less thannada.Chances are, unless you're Dominican, a Caribbean history buff or a fan of Julia Alvarez's, you knowmierdaabout Trujillo or his reign of terror or how badly Dominican women have been treated.And, if you haven't read this book. . . you don't know Oscar Wao, and that's a tragedy.This book has flavor, it has history, it has imagination, it has science fiction, and, best of all, it hascojones.Diaz, through his narrator, Yunior, presents to the reader a sassy and intelligent Voice that you never doubt, not for one moment. The stories here are as real as they are surreal. And the characters? Even flat on a page, they have souls.Oscar and Yunior represent oppositional masculine forces that somehow combine harmoniously to create one perfect man. Lola and Beli represent the millenial-old scream of all oppressed women.Oscar Wao is a modern day tragic hero, more lovable than Hamlet, and this book is better than black beans and rice with a side of fried yucca.
