This book is one of the most thrilling and addictive books I've ever read! The incredibly paced plot and the abundant twists and turns made it nearly impossible to put down. Don't be intimidated by the length, it reads very quickly, and you'll be wishing for more by the end. I do have a couple complaints though, that I'm willing to ignore in order to give this book 5 stars. The characters are all very young, so don't expect the most challenging dialogue, and don't expect closure at all from the ending. The novel was also unexpectedly thought provoking. You'll ask yourself many questions, such as "what side would I be on?" "what role would I play?", and the best question, "what superpower would I get?" I vastly recommend this novel to all, and I hope you'll read it.
