This review may also be found onA Thousand Little Pages.I think it's been about five minutes since I read the last word ofBattle Royale. My heart is still pounding abnormally fast, and every few seconds, I have to take a break from typing to watch the French countryside rushing by outside the train window instead.* The view is strangely soothing, and I definitely need some calming right now.So.Battle Royale. Was. Epic. Dare I say it? It was better thanThe Hunger Games, andThe Hunger Gamesis one of my favorites. Both have similar settings: a dystopian government that forces children into an arena and makes them kill each other off one by one. ButBattle Royaleended up as the more striking, more intense, of the two. The novel grabbed me, strapped me to a poodle, and threw me off a cliff. How does a poodle save a person from a fall off a cliff, you may ask. It doesn't. That's why I kind of feel like an insignificant smudge on the ground right now.UnlikeThe Hunger Games, which focuses only on Katniss's narrative,Battle Royalejumps around from one student to another. I didn't find that disorienting or discontinuous. The skipping around revealed quite a lot about each participant of the Program, as the government calls this bloodbath. Such intricate lines bind all the classmates together, and it's so saddening to watch it all fall apart. There are love interests and friendships and histories and their own survival to consider as the 15-year-olds wander around an island with machine guns, scared out of their wits. What a story Takami-san has dreamt up. What a story.And the ending, too. Wow, if you thoughtThe Hunger Games's ending was jarring, you will be totally unprepared forBattle Royale's. Takami-san wrote it with the flare of a pro, although I kind of want to punch him now...The only thing I disliked were the gory scenes.Battle Royalewas a lot more graphic than I'd imagined. So instead of puking up the contents of my stomach, I just skipped the paragraphs describing blood and bashed-in brains. The human imagination is always a lot more vivid than a movie scene. Normally, that's a good thing, but now, not so much.I would say that I'm now a fangirl ofBattle Royale, but given the book's subject matter, I don't think that'd be entirely appropriate. Apparently, Takami-san is writing (or has already written) a second novel. I must hunt it down.*My first vacation in Europe!Book Source: Borrowed
