How can I put into words the magnificence of this book?!I CAN'T!But I'll tell you what, I'm gonna find an old abandoned well and crawl to the bottom, and then I'm gonna sit there for three days with nothing to eat and only water to drink and all I'm gonna do is think aboutThe Wind-Up Bird Chronicleand how it is one of the most beautiful books I have ever read, how I want to read it again right now, how it moved me to tears on numerous occasions, how it's evocative prose sucked me in and held me down... how I had to force myself to stop reading just so I could make it last.And after that I will crawl out into the glaring sunlight and lay down in the tall grass. I will let the sunlight permeate my body and I will feel satisfied because I know that true beauty and true horror exist in this world simultaneously. And I know that the power of the written word still has the ability to take my breath away, to leave me reeling. This book gives me hope.
