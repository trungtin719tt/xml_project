This book was a childhood favorite of mine, and I suspect that my love of metafiction stems from this book. However, as an adult I find this book to be slightly sadistic. Grover BEGS you to not turn the page in order to keep from reaching the monster that will be found on the final page ((view spoiler)[The monster turns out to be 'lovable furry old' Grover himself(hide spoiler)]), building brick walls and such to thwart your progress. However, the fun is laughing at Grover as you ignore his pleas and keep on pushing forward to the end.Perhaps the positive message is to be brave and face your fears though. Either way, this is a fun book and an interesting example of how reader and book can interact. It has become a staple of my own daughters bedtimes.Highly recommended if you have young children. Other titles to check out are the sequel,Another Monster at the End of This BookorHide and Seek: with Lovable, Furry Old Grover (Pictureback
