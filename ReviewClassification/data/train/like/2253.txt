She's really not that bad.Then we really get to know her and I'm likeThen ALL this stuff happens and I don't know what to expect, because now we're at the After part, and I'm excited...Then BAM!And I'm like...Because there is NO WAY that can happen and I'm pretty sure someone is playing a sick, sick joke on me.Then I realize its not a joke, and the waterworks start flowing...And I'm like...And...Then I finally calm down...And I'm trying to stay strong and remember it's only a book so I'm like...Then I can't help myself and go back to ugly crying...Then FINALLY... acceptance.or as close as I can get to it!Then, after all that, I realize... I LOVE THIS BOOK!
