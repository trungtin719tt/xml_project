The Hiding Placeis, next toThe Diary of a Young Girlby Anne Frank, one of the best and most inspirational true stories I've ever read about finding the courage and resilience to outsmart the evils of Nazism in one of humanity's darkest hours. Corrie was a strong woman and this book gives a lot of insight into what she faced.
