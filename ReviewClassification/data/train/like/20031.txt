Having been a fan of Khaled Hosseini's first two books--even before they were published--I am delighted to say that this book may be his best one yet! It's a heart-felt, multi-generational tale that combines many characters and storylines...each one more gut wrenching than the last. I read most of this book in a perpetual state of goosebumps, and the last 20 pages with tears streaming down my face.And the Mountains Echoed--far more complex and multi-layered than his prior two novels--proves that Hosseini is deserving of his many awards and accolades. He truly is a masterful storyteller.
