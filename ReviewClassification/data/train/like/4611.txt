Now what can I say about this but apart from its amazing. The box set is massive (and heavy). Now I will admit I probably read this faster than normal as I have already had a number of the individual books already - however when the chance came along to own this book at a fraction of the cost (and making it cheaper than if I were to buy the rest of the book individually) how could I resist.Now for anyone who has not read Calvin and Hobbes (where have you been!) you will at least recognise the characters if not what they do.Basically you have a six year old boy Calvin, a precocious little boy who's imagination runs wild. Here you share in his world as he is enjoys life while trying to make sense of the world around him. All the time sharing his adventures and observations with his imaginary best friends Hobbes a huge equally precocious tiger.Now this book represents the complete work by Bill Watterson of his Calvin and Hobbes comics from November 18, 1985 to December 31, 1995 and as sad as the fact is that there will be no more you have to admire the fact they have survived so long and stayed so fresh to this day (and no doubt beyond).If ever you want something to life your heart and make you smile the comic adventures of Calvin and Hobbes must surely be considered.
