When I was in grade school, the anime adaptation of Anne of Green Gables was aired here in our country. I instantly saw myself in Anne because I'm talkative, passionate and a bit stubborn then, therefore, it's easy for me to get drawn immediately to the story. I never read any of the L.M. Montgomery's books even how much I adore Anne Shirley and even if how many times I saw the copies of her books in a local thrift bookstore.However, when I saw that there's an available series of this in Netflix, I consider that now is the right time to start reading the original novels. From how much I love the anime series that I've watched when I was still young, I believe that my affection to the story and Anne's character revitalize when I read this classic. I'm quite certain that I will buy the physical copy of the entire book series of Anne of Green Gables because this is a great addition to my library.
