This novel is a unique attempt at combining the power of visual and textual storytelling.Page after page, we follow a string of drawings that speak for themselves, moving the story forwards while zooming in and out to change perspectives. Then we turn a page and find ourselves confronted with text, and we are continuing the story by reading instead of watching, - starting exactly where the last illustration left us. The difference between this novel and an illustrated children's book is that the drawings don't show what the text says - they show the gaps between the written sequences.The result is stunning!You are forced to think your own words while looking at the pictures, and then they follow you into the written sections, creating an idea of the boundaries and connections between literature and visual arts.The story itself is a love song to creative life. Each work of art - a clock, an automaton, a toy, a drawing, a book - is proof of life spent well.Recommended to children of all ages!
