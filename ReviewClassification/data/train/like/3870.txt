I read this because of its ratings here and on amazon and blogs, and I have to say, what a surprise. This isn't my usual book, or so I thought. But it turns out I don't have a usual book, just those that keep me turning the pages, excited and involved. What's going to happen next? How did this writer learn all this stuff? How long did she have to research? Has anyone read the selected bibliography at the back of the book? Damn. I am so impressed. And then to read what she's made of all those books. Cutting through all the complexities so-called scholars make of things, ignoring those who take everything literally, soaring into realms of brilliant idea. Okay, I'm might be going on a little here, but this was some book. Someone here said it read like "some teenager" wrote it. Are they kidding? I'd like to meetthatteenager. Teenagers can barely talk, much less conceive of the ideas presented in this book. As for the story, it's a mindblower. Taking that old Biblical mess, four gospels, four different stories, and coming up with one coherent heart-wrenching tale of people on the spiritual edge in the middle of a world gone mad with ideology and Roman domination. Shades of what is happening right now in the very same spot on earth. What's with the so-called Holy Land? It produces such crazed ugliness and then, once in a while, the sublime. I think this book is sublime.
