All you who are reading these very lines right now, are waiting for a review, an analysis maybe ofJourney to the End of the Night, I bet. Well, I regret to say that I'll most probably disappoint you. In fact -and I don't mean to talk down the admittedly great job some reviewers have done here- I don't think one can properly review this book. You can talk about it or the way you felt reading it but the true essence of it should be experienced through reading it and not some ridiculous review a loser like me will foolishly attempt to write. In other words, stop reading my review, go to the nearest bookshop and buy the damned thing!Before you do that though, I'd like to warn you that it's not a light read. Be prepared to have to stop every five or so pages and stare at the wall with a blank look on your face. Be prepared to feel your mind go numb while trying to process those words that seem to feed voraciously on your brain cells. This book consumed two and a half weeks of my life and I'm proud of every second I spent lost in its pages. If you don't feel up to it however, don't bother with this journey that starts with the atrocities of the WW1 and ends in some lousy parisenne pub. Or does it? Come to think of it, this journey is unlikely to ever come to an end. Afterall, the night is endless and seems to stretch out toward the infinity and beyond our hypocritical, petty lives. See what I'm talking about? Consider yourselves warned.
