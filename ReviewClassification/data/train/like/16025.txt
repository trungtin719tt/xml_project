Harrowing and brutal yet beautiful, like its landscape but crude like the people in it.Poetic movie it made though. And it coined a great term almost everyone uses.More tragic than the tragedy in this novel is that Evans turned the success of this book into his running formula. What's the point of repetitive storylines? Plus, I don't know, British writers writings as Americans bother me for some reason. It shouldn't but it does. I can't think of any American writer doing the same. Yet who am I to talk? Maybe all roads do lead to Rome.
