This book is a whole other beast. Throughout Wolfe uses phonetics to great effect in casting his characters in all their brutal-and-suave-tongued rage. The Haves rave against the Have-nots; the Have-nots rage against the rich. And in the end, every single character, the Haves and Have-nots alike, is no better than the other. The only way you win is to embrace your animal nature, the nature to survive at all costs.I found the character of Peter Fallow dull throughout most of the novel, but as the book was written he was a needed character in order to propel the plot forward. I enjoyed all of other characters, with their chest-thumping and sheer conceitedness. It makes for hilarious reading. The depths of irony that Wolfe portrayed when each character began to inwardly judge the other: brilliance.The writing style can take some getting used to. There are lots of inner monologues, soul searching, coming to terms w/ ones nature and the nature of the world, and the above mentioned use of phonetics can give the reader pause. There are times when inner monologue and direct dialog vie for position on the page, and other times where characters talk over each other and may or may not be carrying on to entirely different conversations. But if you stick with it, Wolfe shows you the method to his madness by using and reusing his techniques until they feel like second nature.If you want to experience some amazing literary innovations this is well worth the read. But you'll stay for the intricately woven plot that has as much inevitability as Shakespeare at his best.
