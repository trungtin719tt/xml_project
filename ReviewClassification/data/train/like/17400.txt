If you want a really good, insightful review of House of Leaves (that I didn't write), goread this one from Aerin.If you want to read mine, here you go:House of Leaves isn't one of those tidy little things that holds your hand and wipes your bottom and tells you that you're special. It makes you work, and what you get out of it depends largely on how much work you're willing to do. House of Leaves is difficult at times, incredibly complex, occasionally pretentious, and(view spoiler)[ it doesn't neatly wrap up some of the biggest questions it raises(hide spoiler)].When I finished it, I thought I was unsatisfied with(view spoiler)[the ending(hide spoiler)], but itlivedin me long after I closed the book. I could not stop thinking about the characters, the puzzles, my various theories about the nature of the story and(view spoiler)[ whether Zampano existed at all, or was just invented by Johnny Truant.(hide spoiler)]Here's the thing about House of Leaves: you can enjoy it simply as a horrifying story that could possibly be true. You could enjoy it as a love story on a number of different levels. You can enjoy it as a whole bunch of puzzles and codes and ciphers. You can enjoy it as a unique reading experience that will make you fall back in love with actual paper books.But however you choose to enjoy it, you've got to just commit to it. Let the book's reality capture you, and ride it out until you finish the book. When you're done, you'll probably find that the House has taken up some space inside you, and you'll wonder if the nightmares will actually come, assuming they haven't already.You'll go back to the beginning, and you'll reread sections large and small. You'll take a magnifying glass to the pictures and you'll spend alongtime reading message boards that haven't been updated since 2004. You'll grab that copy ofPoe'sHauntedthat you bought before you knew House of Leaves existed, and you'll listen to it again in an entirely new way.You'll discover that you live at the end of a five and a half minute hallway....Or maybe you won't. Maybe it won't live in you the way it lives in me... but it's worth your time to find out.
