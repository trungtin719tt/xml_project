Bring back some eggs he said. My daughter needs them for her wedding cake he says....Sounds simple, right? Except this is wartime and eggs are nowhere to be found. The Nazis have invaded Leningrad and Lev Beniov has been arrested and thrown in a cell with a slightly older and more experienced deserter named Kolya. The men are tasked with finding eggs for a powerful Soviet colonel instead of facing the firing squad.Thus, begins Lev and Kolya's journey through the rough and extremely dangerous streets of Leningrad. There they find starving people willing to do the unimaginable to survive. They find danger, friendship, lust, fear, pain and hope.This book is raw and powerful in that it does not hold any punches when showing the hardships of war. People are willing to go to extremes to survive and prove that they are stronger than they look and braver than they think.See more of my reviews atwww.openbookpost.com
