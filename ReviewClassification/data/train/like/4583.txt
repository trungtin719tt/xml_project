So I cheated on my local library last week. I don't think she knows yet, and I feel kind of bad about it. I discovered a smaller library that was actually much closer to my house. She definitely caught my attention, but I never went because it just seemed like the selection was going to be much smaller, and my current library and I have a great thing going right now.But now I'm involved with two libraries and, boy, is my life going great!I found this book at the new library where I couldn't find anything else that jumped out to me. I mean, the fiction section is like three rows, maybe four. That includes every genre of fiction. No mystery, romance, horror... it's all fiction.This is the book I left with last week, and this is now my favorite Stephen King book. This is King at the top of his game. It's the perfect length with all six parts, it ends well, and he doesn't rely on horror or too much salty language to tell a fantastic story.I've always said King is the best when he stays under 400 pages or so and doesn't write about vampires or monsters. He dabbles in the supernatural here, but not for the sake of scaring the reader. He just really, really hit a home run with this thing.I liked having six separate parts combined into one novel. Each new section felt fresh with a new plot element, and King helps reset the scene from where he left off before. The characters are all well developed and none of them are too outlandish or over-the-top. Even the antagonist. That was great.I have a solid love/hate relationship with Mr. King, but I loved this one. Seriously, this is my favorite book I've read from him. Go read it if you haven't already. And watch the movie because it's a classic on its own.And, thank you Stephen King for a beautiful first date with my local library. I hope our future encounters are this incredible.
