This is the most iconic of all popular Christmas books -- and for a reason. This is the first book that named the eight reindeer, and was responsible for the popular "vision" of what Santa Claus looks like today!This book sets forth a poem penned by Clement C. Moore -- a man known in his time for publishing his "Hebrew and English Lexicon" -- for his children one Christmas. I've read this so many times that I could recite it from memory, but I'd rather read this beautiful version which includes illustrations for the poem by Arthur Rackham drawn in the late 1800s or early 1900s.Reading this book on Christmas Eve, just before my children go to bed, has been a life-long tradition. I'm certain to be reading it again this year on Christmas Eve for my adult children who will be visiting!This book is a Christmas must!
