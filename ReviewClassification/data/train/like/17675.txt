This was a YA paranormal romance, which picked up where the first book left off.I liked Ever in this but she was entirely too trusting at times. I felt sorry for her when things started going wrong with Damen though and she was powerless to do anything about it.The storyline in this was about Damen suddenly turning on Ever and wanting nothing to do with her, and Ever not knowing why. There was a new guy at school who seemed to want her even when she turned him down, and things just generally seemed to be going wrong for her. This was an enjoyable story, and it held my attention well throughout.The ending to this was a giant cliff-hanger!7 out of 10
