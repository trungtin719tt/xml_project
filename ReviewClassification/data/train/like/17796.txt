^this is to all the h8ers who don't appreciate some good YA paranormal angstbc this shit was... good??? i've been pretty let down by a lot of YA latelyshatter meso it was kind of refreshing to read something that was nice and entertaining.now let's be clear:this book isn't going to win any awards for like, achievements in literaturebut it was FUN. we have "pure" blooded hematoi (descendent from Greek gods) and we've got, you guessed it, half bloods. both breeds fight daimons which are pure blooded hematoi that have been "turned."yes. this is a lot like vampire academy.but actually, the lore is better!because pure bloods and half bloods only sort of coexist. there's some inherent racism in the system. which definitely comes into play in this book; it's also a subtle thing in VA but was never fully addressed in the way that i wanted to be. i have a feeling that in future books this magical racism is gonna come into play more.me likey real world issues in fantasy in paranormal.that's it for plot. now the good stuff:man meatsthere's a scinty hinty of some super speciallove geometryand i'll be real clear with you: I DON'T GIVE A FUCK WHAT YOU SAY. i like love triangles. but i also think if you hate love triangles that you will still enjoy this.also probably good to mention that our main hoe, alex, is super fun and kick ass with vulnerability. we stan a self aware queen.if you're looking for some freaking FUN paranormal and you've been slumpy, give this a go.PS thank you jess for the inadvertent recommendation, you're the realest.-----------------------------i'm ashamed to admit that i've started reading this...also saddened to say that this is a less exciting, age gap free, vampire academy rip off with worse lore. but... i also have poor taste. so i'm going to continue reading it.
