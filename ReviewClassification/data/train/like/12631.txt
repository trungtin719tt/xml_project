"Buy the truth, and do not sell it,also wisdom and instruction and understanding"-&gt; Psalm 23:23A wholly satisfying read (and respectable look at Puritan life)!(I'm a 23 yr old [in college] guy, and-&gt;) Who knew I'd get so emotionally invested??I certainly didn't.There were several parts when I was legitimately frustrated, angry, and a little teary-eyed (to level with you...).My favorite scenes were quite easily John's return home (the teary-eyes; c'mon-&gt; I'm just trying to give you an honest review) as well as the final pages of the book.Sidenote-&gt; With a character named "Thankful Peabody", how could you possibly go wrong?Sidenote-sidenote-&gt; Goodwife Cruff was completely (and impressively) unlikeable.If I'm lucky enough to have a daughter or two, this one'll most definitely have a space their bookshelf.
