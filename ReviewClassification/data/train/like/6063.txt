I liked that this is a book to be read slowly. Having seen the movie first and having lived in wet country fleshed out the visuals for me. I found myself thinking of Faulkner at times. Not the convoluted story lines but the discriptive nature of the narrative. Of Charles Sutpen and Inman coming from the same culture. And still we see a few remnant elements of the South unwilling to put the War behind.Perhaps Inman's remaining hold on sanity is Ada. As his days of magnetic wandering stretch innumerable and precariously in front of him his grasp becomes stronger. His vision of her settles into his center. The differences between them are from an opposite genesis. She pulls herself to grow, to become an adult, (via Ruby) a recipiant of consequence and consequences. Inman pulls himself to put one foot in front of the other, to remain an adult (and I don't mean reverting to childishness) maintaining empathy and compassion for others in the face of exercising and exorcising a brutally strong will to survive. He sees himself as damaged goods. She sees the harvest."Ruby said that she did, and Ada asked if Ruby thought Stobrod had written the song. Ruby said there were many songs that you could not say anybody in particular made by himself. A song went around from fiddler to fiddler and each one added something and took something away so that in time the song became a different thing than what it had been, barely recognizable in either tune or lyric. But you could not say that the song had been improved, for as was true of all human effort, there was never advancement. Everything added meant something lost, and about as often as not the thing lost was preferable to the thing gained, so that over time we'd be lucky if we just broke even. Any thought otherwise was empty pride."I liked this book. It requires patience.
