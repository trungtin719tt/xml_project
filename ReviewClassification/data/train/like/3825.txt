I'm psychic. Yes ladies and gents, you heard me right. It's true. I predicted everything. I quote myself; "I think that(view spoiler)[Tasha(hide spoiler)]killed the queen. She's just a little too suspect... Plus, she hit on Dimitri, which made me hate her. NO ONE BUT ME (and, ok, maybe Rose too) CAN HIT ON DIMITRI!".This was indeed the perfect ending to a perfect series. It was brutally real and totally heartbreaking in places, but it was never predictable. I loved every minute of it, and it was definitely my favourite book in the entire series. Dimitri and Rose in this... Well. What can I say? My Favourite part? In the motel at the begining of the book. I bet Dimitri didn't seethatcoming. I'm pretty sure at that moment I squeed out loud.I give this 5 billion stars... even if it is just out of five!P.S I would bet my house that the spin off series will be about Adrian falling in love with Sydney. It's such a given. Listen to me! I'm psychic, remember?Later Note: Wow. Adrian/Sydney spin off happened. I actually am psycic- I really need to invest in shares or something...
