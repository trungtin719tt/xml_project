This is one of the best books in the Chronicles of Narnia series! The beginning got me so frustrated, as I can't stand how the ape Shift treated the donkey Puzzle; also how "puzzled" &amp; dumb Puzzle can really be. The climax &amp; the ending is VERY exciting! This really give me a glimpse of how heaven will be like, as I can't stop smiling and laughing in the end. What really surprised me is how the ending is so unpredictable, but is THE best happily ever ending I've ever heard. You have to read the book to find out what it is...! It really shows how wondrous Aslan is and how he always has the right &amp; just punishment for all. Even though this is a fiction, specifically fantasy story, it really tells you a lot about the truths and reality of our own world &amp; heaven.Favorite Quote:"You see," said Aslan. "They will not let us help them. They have chosen cunning instead of belief. Their prison is only in their own minds, yet they are in that prison; and so afraid of being taken in that they cannot be taken out. But come, children, I have other work to do." (P. 169)
