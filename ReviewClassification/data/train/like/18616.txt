While this book will sadly always be bogged down in Nietzsche's unresolved and immature childhood angst, his poetic brilliance is...well, brilliant.The real stride of Zarathustra lies more at the beginning, with the prophet's existence rather petering out toward the end, rather than the usual ascent into spiritual ecstasy with which similar stories finish. Still, I suppose if I read the text as an insight into the mind of Nietzsche himself - rather than an educational, theological journey - then the parallels of the author's and his subject's psyches is very satisfying.I should mention that I am not at all offended by the decidedly anti-feminine sentiment that is ubiquitous in the book. This is precisely because - as a woman, and therefore with a biological predisposition toward empathy and care of another human being - I can see the source of his anger. Most of the men around him died when he was very young, leaving the females to be the rule-setters and law-enforcers of an ultra emo kid. Of course the kid aggrandized the "heavenly destiny" of the male, and the earthly, practicality of the female. Again, it is a very sad fate for this book that it's author should be so bound by his own circumstance. Oh well...To summarize my feelings in total: where I was absorbed, I was completely and utterly absorbed. Where my maturity superseded both Nietzsche and Zarathustra, I merely rolled my eyes a bit and moved on.This is a piece that I would consider an absolutely phenomenal achievement for a scholar at the peak of his career, but that could certainly do with revision and clarification later on in life.Unfortunately, Zarathustra's end was the same as Nietzsche: exhaustion brought on by decades of wild mood swings resulting in a vague form of oblivion. The wildness was exhilarating, and fortunately compensated for the occasional trough.
