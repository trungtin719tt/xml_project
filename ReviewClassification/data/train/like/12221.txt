this book was amazing. the ending was bittersweet, i cried. Marie Lu knows how to make you feel for a character. the ending. Day. Oh my gosh just so surprising. Day/ Daniel was such an inspiration! just wow. and June was such a strong character, she was even a strong willed character in her weakest moments. Just go get this book! its worth every penny!
