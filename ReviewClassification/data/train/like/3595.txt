Oh My ---I think I need to read this again........Maybe I was on drugs the first time I read it.................(wait: I didn't do drugs --even during the 60's while living in Berkeley .....I was a straight arrow)! Maybe that was my problem........Help.............I must read this book again!I have my reasons --I'm leaving it at that!
