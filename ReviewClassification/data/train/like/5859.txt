You have to believe. Otherwise, it will never happen.Man,oh man,what a story! The illustrations brought it to a whole new level.We have Tristan, half fairy thanks to his father's infidelity.In a fit of youthful passion Tristian promises the beautiful Victoria tobring her back a star.But to do that, he has to crossthe Wall. Since he's young, dumb and full of love for his sweet, he takes off with nary a thought.And thusbegins his harrowing journey.tHe crosses the gap in the Wall and into the land of fairy. While he may not have gained what he sought, he returns with something far greater.The art provides a fantastic enhancement!There's something about having pictures on nearly every page that brings this book to the next level.Very rarely someone comes to Wall knowing what they are looking for, and these people they will sometimes allow through. There is a look in the eyes, and once seen it cannot be mistaken.Very rarely does a quote send me looking.After reading this story, I paid attention to stone fences around pastures and farms, hoping to find an entrance to the Wall.You have to believe. Otherwise, it will never happen.Anyone who believes what a cat tells him deserves all he gets.Blog|Instagram|Twitter
