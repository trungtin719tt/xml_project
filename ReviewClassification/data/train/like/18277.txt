An unforgetting read :)It's kind of impossible to explain the sensations you experience while reading this novel, because it's that kind of story that feels so wrong, and yet you can't stop reading it, be obsessed about it, love it, hate it, hunt every word with frenzy so you can find out what happens next..I had one of the most complicated relations with Frederick.. a hate-love-hate kind of situation. I know, you will say"What can one possibly like at this character?". He is a psiho, a crazy man, weard and broken. But I felt sorry for him sometimes, thought his lonelyness made it this person.. I believed he needed so desperate to be loved, admired, and that he will change at some point, make the right choices, repair all the damage he had done unwillingly.. But I was wrong, because he didn't learn nothing, and in the end, he was the same bastard.I loved Miranda so much, her power, her struggle, her personality. I admire her, she is an impressive character, a strong and yet sensitive woman, an atist.. She lost her freedom but not her judgement. Being captivated didn't changed her that much..It was perfect that the book had two POVs.. That the first half is narrated by the collector, and the other by Miranda.. This novel wasn't as I expected, I am a romantic and I wanted a love story, but that would have been, besides of wrong, predictable. And John Fowles doesn't write nothing predictable, so I find it perfect the way it is, even with the unexpected, heartbreaking end.This book is a hunting psihological thriller, that had an impact on me..
