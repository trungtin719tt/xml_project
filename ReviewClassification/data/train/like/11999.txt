TBR jar pick for January 2016It's easy to underestimate the Beats now, in this era (of which the better parts, one might argue, they helped bring about). It's easy to dismiss it all as "attempting to shock" and "deliberately aggressive/anarchist/lewd/[whichever other titles have been slapped on this collection over the years]". They're Holden Caulfield, they're Jim Stark, they're Don Quixote tilting at windmills.But the truth is that the Beats, that Allen Ginsberg, that Howl, was revolutionary at a time when poetry could spark a revolution - and at a time when such sparks were as much dangerous as they were subversive. The truth is that Ginsberg's audacity was not only ahead of his time then, but is also ahead of its time now.And there's something incredibly disheartening about that. But where the cultural value of this collection is concerned, it is also incrediblyreal.Because while some notions Ginsberg seems to deem the wildest of dreams have become a reality we are accustomed to today, others are ones we have yet to achieve. And ones we have become frightened to express. And this poetry, at its core, has not only retained its value, but also its very real implications. Despite an occasional cue taken from Baudelaire, Ginsberg's poetry was not l'art pour l'artisme. It was an art for the sake of change. Or - rather - art with the hope of change. It was art meant to provoke, meant to halt, meant to reflect the society until eventually the society reflected it the art in return.And we aren't there quite yet.And part of it - the part that laments an individual getting lost in a (harsh and unyielding) system - is the part which might well retain its relevance forever.
