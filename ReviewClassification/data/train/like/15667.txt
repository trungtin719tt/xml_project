I enjoyed this book quite a bit, but it's also probably my least favorite in the series so far. I've been (slowly) reading the series in publication order so, if my friends can be trusted, it's supposed to keep going up in terms of quality from these first installments. It's hard to pass up Equal Rites, which I really had a fun time with.Having said it's my least favorite, it's still good. Terry Pratchett is generally delightful and I just found the other books better. I looked forward to getting back into this book each night, which says a lot.The character of Death is so good and really all the characters in the book too, but Death takes the cake, especially when he tries out other occupations or just generally ... living...I'll keep slowly making my way through this series. Every now and then I'm back in the mood for another so here's to Sourcery in the next month to two years!3.5 out of 5 Stars (recommended)
