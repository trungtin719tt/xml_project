I re-read this book for the third time last night, it's been a few years since I last read it, and I was reminded of how much I enjoy it. It's hilarious!I've always enjoyed this book and wondered what it would have been like to have actually lived with the Gilbreths.(view spoiler)[Isn't it sad that although their dad pushed them through grades and made them skip he never got to see any of them through college or get married?(hide spoiler)]
