I am a fan of anything to do with the Roman Empire. I find it endlessly fascinating how much of their systems of law and politics we continue to use and the amount of their language that is still a part of our lives.As the intention must obviously have been, seeing as the point of view is from Claudius writing a history, this book is heavy on the facts and chronicles of events. Though it is written with a personal opinion on the characters, as Claudius is their contemporary.I found the style of story very successful. It was engrossing and captivating, however I did find myself getting a little confused about the family tree after a bit. Definitely a great way to soak up a little information about the Romans and while away a few afternoons of summer.
