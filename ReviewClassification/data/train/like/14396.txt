I was an avid reader as a child and still remember picking up my aunt's copy of Christy on her bookshelf. I don't remember the thickness of the book, or how old I was, but I do remember reading the book to the end and feeling slightly disappointed at how the romance ended... it wasn't clear enough or passionate enough to my childish mind. I remember taking the book to my mom, showing her the end, and asking her. Does this mean that she marries _____? And Mom, bless her heart, not having read the book, didn't know. She did read the book after that and bought her own copy so it is on her bookshelves.I never could get the girls interested in any of Grandma's old books, but when an opportunity to review and promote Christy for the 50th anniversary came open I jumped. It's a classic. My girls NEED to read it. But my fifteen year old got scared off by the thickness and the first person point of view. My twelve year old is a reluctant reader.So that means I get to read the book out loud to my daughters. And we are, a chapter a day. The girls stop what they are doing, listen to the story and at the end of a chapter beg for another, but i don't have time to read all day long -- and especially not out loud. I caught my reluctant reader picking it up and reading ahead (until she got scared off by some of the old words, and big words). Both girls are falling in love with Christy as I did, and now they want to watch the DVD which is on our shelf, even though I remind them the movie is always different than the book.They, like I did, are falling in love with the young Christy and are amazed and shocked and humbled by her adventures, struggles, and experiences.With this new release, Christy is available to a whole new generation of readers and I'm sure they will get as much enjoyment out of it as the original group fifty years ago got.Grab your copy of Christy now. This will also make a great gift for a reader on your holiday list.
