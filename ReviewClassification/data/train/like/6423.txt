What makes a book last and last, continued to be read? I want to know because, if at all possible, that's the kind of book I'd like to write. Here's a book that was first published in 1959 and which I read when I was sixteen and now fifty or so years later I read again. It is the story of two friends, Gene and Phineas in a New Hampshire elite boarding school as War World II rages and awaits them. The forces of evil played out in the macrocosm of Europe and in the microcosm of a boy's soul. I read this book again because when you read a great book for the second or third time, you can afford to slow down and see how the author does what he does. What I wanted to see most of all was how envy and guilt and goodness and forgiveness are shown, portrayed, painted carefully by craftsman, in the way the characters speak, in the particular sequence of their words, in the way they walk, in the movement of their eyes and even in the architecture of the buildings and in the icy New England landscape. Nouns and adjectives for emotions are rare. The word "envy" was used once. I wasn't told how people felt, but I could see and feel what they were feeling without being told. This, this is why books last. And not just the way they are written but also the truth they convey, truth immediately recognizable and understood, as simple and concrete as a tree and so complicated that words cannot fully explain it.
