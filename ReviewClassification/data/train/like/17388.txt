I loved the whole idea - the clash of two fantasy worlds. And I LOVED Tsuranuanni, it's just a fascinating place - no metal, Ancient Chinese culture, giant ants...anyway, it's all good stuff.But what I loved most, was watching something happen to Feist that it seems like he didn't entirely plan. I dunno, I could be totally wrong. Maybe he planned from the start to have Arutha kind of monopolise the story and make his other two main characters look...fairly boring. Okay, Pug wasn't boring, but he was so powerful at the end, I lost interest. Tomas WAS boring. But Arutha...During the first half of the book he was just this background character. He was there, but he seemed a largely decorative figure, you weren't even sure he was gonna survive their snowy journey (although he was named, so...). Then at some point, he just stands up, coughs, and kind of goes "I've got this, I'll take it from here." And suddenly he IS the main character. And that's...FINE. More than fine. I am such a fangirl...There's a reason the sequels focus on our dark, sardonic Prince, and not on the wizard boy.
