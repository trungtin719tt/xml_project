When in high school I read the Iliad and Odyssey. After completing them I had to run down Virgil's Aeneid. If you've ever read these books the word pictures of this epic story (Greek myth and then Roman) will I believe be somewhat burned into your mind. I doubt you'll ever have clearer ones. Though written centuries ago the epic tales of mythological gods, goddesses, and heroes will stay with you. For me also the "shift" from Greek characters to Roman (especially in the case of the mythological deities) was extremely, what(?) interesting(?). That might be the word. the way Homer sees Aphrodite and Virgil sees Venus are, different. Maybe complimentary would be an applicable word, though it seems to me that they had at times radically different views of them. Where I went away from Homer picturing Aphrodite, Ares and their allies in a more negative light, Virgil seemed to see that particular party in a more sympathetic light.As one view of the "heroic" mythical past this is an enjoyable and (dare I say it?) worthwhile read.Also I must admit, I always enjoyed fanciful type literature (and stories). As a kid it was harder to find stories of swords, daring do magic and mayhem than it is now and mythology served quite well. Like a lot of people (including Tolkien and Lewis) I preferred Norse mythology, but Greek and Roman would do in a pinch.So, think about it, erudition and high adventure all in one book, what's not to like? It's a win/win.
