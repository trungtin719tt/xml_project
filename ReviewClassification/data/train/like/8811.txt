4 1/2 *I still can recall watching the original Brideshead on Masterpiece Theater, along with most of my friends at the time. Being enthralled with the actors, performances and story. Charles ryder will always be Jeremy Irons for me. Now I've finally read the book behind that performance and am not at all disappointed.As I settled in to read, I was immediately struck by the language, the period phrasing and speech, and became a bit doubtful as to whether I was actually going to enjoy this book. However, doubt disappeared very quickly each time I resumed reading. Almost immediately I was back in the story, back with Charles and Sebastien or Julia or Charles' rather odd father or the many members of the Marchmain family. As always seems true, there is more depth in the book than what I recall from the film, more to ponder in my relationships with others (though I know no one with such an estate or title). That's what good reading is about and why some books become classics. They tell the tales of friendships won and lost, conflicts over ethics and morals, love and sometimes hate or simply love abandoned.Recommended for readers of classics, period writing 1920s, 1930s British
