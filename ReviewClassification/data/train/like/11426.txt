I am FLYING through these books!Okay now it feels like the movie and the book are two completely different things. Again, I'm not complaining. I love both of them but I do admit that it was hard picturing all the 'new' scenarios since my mind kept going back to the movie ones.Can we just take a moment to appreciate Newt? He's the sanest and smartest person among all of them. Such a sweety...ugh I love him.Oh also... Minho's character's a bit unrefined..borderline rude. I mean I know I sound like a kid 'O my gosh he ish sho rood' i just think the movie Minho is better. This one...not so much.
