When I first read this book several years ago, I was terribly impressed by1) her writing style, which I really like - I wish I could write like that2) the interesting plot of a single girl who had avoided teenage pregnancy through her young life only to end up with someone else's baby3) the relationship she has with her mother, who believes her daughter "hung the moon in the sky" and can absolutely do no wrong. I think it would be wonderful if my daughters came out of their childhoods not pregnant, and with the assurance that I think they are so wonderful.
