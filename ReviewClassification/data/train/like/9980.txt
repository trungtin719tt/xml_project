This was a thoroughly enjoyable, fresh-feeling book about 18 year old Sabriel and her quest through the land of her birth. If more YA was written like this, I'd read more of it. Of course, I should point out that this book was published in 1995, well before the genre was Twilighted and, as such, there were no uber emo teenagers angsting over their melodramatic love triangles. And thank the universe for that! Instead we get a sensible and somewhat awkward young heroine who is afraid of the dark currents swirling around her, anxious about her abilities to meet the oncoming challenges, yet nevertheless determined to deal with any obstacles as they come. Along the way she finds help and opposition in equal measure but the focus always remains on her journey. She is young and inexperienced but she's smart enough to ask questions and to accept help when it is honestly offered - no obnoxious false bravado from this young lady."Fear and realization of ignorance were strong medicines against stupid pride."The story was a little slow to get moving but the writing style felt so smooth and comfortable that I didn't mind. The magic system was intriguing, as was the whole matter of dealing with the Dead, and the description of the Nine Gates painted quite a picture. It also presents a reality where a more traditional fantasy land, known as the Old Kingdom, shares a border with a more modern world - complete with cars - known as Ancelstierre. I still have some questions about how that whole situation evolved and I hope that the answers will come in the rest of the trilogy. And speaking of that, now that I know that these books are narrated by Tim Curry, I plan to finish out the trilogy in audiobook format.P.S. I freaking LOVED Moggett!!
