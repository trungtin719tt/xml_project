At first I was going to rate it 4.5 stars, but that ending made me smile so much and I think that was what I've been looking for in this saga. I wanted a PJO book to end leaving me with a warm feeling in my heart and I didn't get it until this book &lt;3. I love Nico so much. Also, I really like Poseidon :').So 5 stars!
