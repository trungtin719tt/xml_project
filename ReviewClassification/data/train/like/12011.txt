I read this years ago as a child and just finished re-reading it with my 7-year-old son. It actually touched off a lot of interesting discussions about what has changed and what has stayed the same in the years since the book was first published in 1967 (my son piped up with all kinds of objections throughout the book, like "what about the motion detectors and the lasers around the art?"). Of course today admission is no longer free at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, no one is allowed to bring in backpacks and instrument cases, and it took me a good 20 minutes to explain to my son what a typewriter was and how it's different from a computer keyboard. Given these dramatic changes in technology and security, it's even more to Mrs. Konigsberg's credit that her book has endured throughout the decades, remaining as relevant and compelling as ever to each new generation of children and inspiring their interest in museums and art history. There is a terrific issue of Museum Kids available for free download on the Metropolitan Museum of Art's web site, written for kids, that includes an article written by the author about how she was inspired to write the book, as well as follow-up information to help kids find the different exhibits described in the book. It also tells which exhibits have been changed or removed, including the restaurant fountain which now resides in South Carolina.
