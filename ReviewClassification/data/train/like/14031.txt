Ahh. This book was awesome. I really really enjoyed the first book, but I think this book was a lot better! I can't wait to get the next!!If you're reading this on your phone, there are spoilers ahead, so beware!(view spoiler)[ So I kind of guessed that Trey was a vampire hunter. We kept hearing about these hunters over and over... And after the first book, I kind of wondered if maybe all of those deaths were just Lee and not hunters...After Trey started getting those bruises I wondered if there was something more... Then after Sydney's attacker reacted the way he did, I figured out it was him. I'm really nervous about how the hunters act towards the Moroi and what will happen in the future books. They better not hurt Adrian or anyone like that.Naturally I've been waiting for Adrian to tell Sydney how he felt for some time now. Who else picked up on how Jill was acting to Sydney was actually coming through the bond? I thought it was pretty funny how she just kept talking about how beautiful she was all the time. I loved the night of the Halloween dance, her "teaching" him to drive (who else guessed he was just pretending? ), the self defense class, and of course the last chapter of the book. I think it's so adorable that Adrian paints. The lily part was so cute! Obviously I was thrilled when they finally kissed and he confessed his feelings. But I dont think any of us were that surprised with how Sydney reacted. She's been terrified of vampires her whole life. Just because she's friends with them now doesn't mean she's going to be okay with them making out with her.... I'm sure she'll get over it soon. ;) or at least I hope.Who else was super bored with Braydon? I think he was an awesome FRIEND for Sydney, and they definitely have a lot they can talk about, but everyone could see there wasn't any passion. Not like the way it is with Adrian. I thought it was hilarious when he broke up with her for being "irresponsible" LOLI feel about for Jill and her love life again. Once again the book is over and she's still not with the right guy. I guess it would have been just TOO easy if her and Eddie had gotten together right away. I'm kind of tired of Angeline though...What does everyone think about Sydney's weird blood? Is it connected with her being able to do magic maybe? Guess we'll find out later.. I know she's terrified of anything magical but I think it's pretty awesome that she can make amulets and things.(hide spoiler)]I can't wait to get the third book! I'm away from home at the moment, and won't return until tomorrow. I had no idea I'd finish this book so quickly or I'd have brought the third as well...
