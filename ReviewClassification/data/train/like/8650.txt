This is my Book Of the Month- February 2017, with GR group- Horror Aficionados.I love watching horror movies and enjoy reading horror books even more. In horror genre, 'Ghost Stories' are my favorite genre and this book just'Fit to a T'.Exorcist is one of the few horror movies that actually shocked and horrified me. And I was really excited to read the original book on which this cult classic was based.If you found the movie scary, the book is grosser and more horrifying in some ways.Maybe it's because the readers imagination is more vast than anything that can be shown on screen....There are few scenes that had me completely grossed out but this book is a definite page turner.The ending is something that I knew about (because of the movie) but still reading it gave me the chills(view spoiler)[ The sacrifice of Damien's life so that the evil spirit leaves Regan's body but in the end the spirit is not destroyed or we can't be sure it has been and will not attach to anyone else. At least it did not enter back into Regan's body is the only positive light in the end....(hide spoiler)]If you like ghost stories this is aMUSTread book....P.S- Have you read any good ghost story books. I would love some recommendations from this genre.
