The ratings and reviews for this book are mixed, and I can understand that because I am balancing some love/hate feelings myself. But it's compelling in it's unique way, and it's certainly tragic.The story is about a fanatical Baptist preacher from Georgia who takes his wife and 4 daughters on a Christian mission to the Belgian Congo in 1959. If that'snot the perfect recipe for disaster then I haven't seen one.The history of this part of Africa, especially the political history, is so convoluted that it defies understanding. And the methods used by some of these Christian missions is also quite baffling. That's certainly the case here.The book is written from 5 points of view, the mother and the 4 daughters. They are the ones most adversely affected by the move, the culture shock, but mostly the influence of an abusive, and severely misguided father. The views and personalities of these characters are so different, it's hard to believe they are part of the same family.The genius of Kingsolver's writing is her ability to bring all this together into a believable and interesting plot. It's a difficult an disturbing read, with characters that have flaws, and events that leave the reader heartbroken.4 stars.
