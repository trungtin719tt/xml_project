I've wanted to read "Mary Poppins" for years now. My mom read me many classic children's novels when I was a kid, and then I discovered some on my own in later years, but this is one that somehow slipped through the cracks. Not that Mary Poppins hasn't been an important figure in my life, thanks to the magic of the movie. I just always pictured her as a smiling, rosy-cheeked, singing, magical lady who looks like Julie Andrews! I was somewhat prepared for the differences between the book and movie given some reviews I've come across (including some that really shocked me, such as those claiming Mary Poppins is a Satanist!) so I braced myself. What I found in the book was a different sort of charm from the film--a different sort of Mary Poppins who was more severe, sarcastic and egotistical, who doesn't sing and who never says "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"--yet was still very well-loved by the children she nannies, and still managed to help them see the magic in life. Read on if you want my thoughts on specific chapters and more detailed comparisons between the book and the movie but it will contain SPOILERS...Only a few chapters in the book match scenes in the film and I must say I think Disney and the script writers were wise to choose what they did."The Day Out" The idea of going into a chalk picture is so charming and exciting and lovely--and it is so beautifully realized in the film (though I never was a fan of the fox hunt!) I think it was really too bad that this is the one adventure in the book Jane and Michael DON'T get to go on. It was absolutely a "date" between Mary Poppins and Bert. But, woe is me, this was the ONLY chapter in the book to feature Bert. And, gosh, I had a HUGE crush on Bert in the movie when I was little--he was SO nice and funny and creative and nice to the kids. The Bert in the novel sells matches and doesn't dance around on chimneys or play a one-man-band. And he's only in that one chapter. Sad!!! (Though perhaps a TAD more realistic as I don't think nannies had more than half an afternoon a week "off" and it really was quite a coincidence that Bert got to go along with them so often in the film.)"Laughing Gas" This is the one where Mary visits her uncle and he is laughing so hard he floats into the air and they have a tea party in the air. This is another chapter that just so appeals to the child's imagination and I thought it was well represented in the film."Miss Lark's Andrew"--the little dog--also makes an appearance in the movie. I thought the chapter in the novel is quite the "message/moral" chapter but it's a good one; I love how pure-bred Andrew sticks up for his mutt friend against the protestations of his snobby owner and helps the mutt find a good home :-)"The Bird Woman"--I must say this is one part of the film that always bummed me out as a kid. The bird woman, no matter how happy she seemed feeding the birds, was so dirty and ragged looking, it just made me sad that all she did all day was sit and feed birds. And the song is sooo melancholy, IMO, even if it's lovely and a lullaby. So, I rather prefered the chapter in the book.That's where the book and movie similarities end, by and large. (Unless the film incorporates aspects from the sequel books.)Regarding the chapters in the book NOT featured in the film, I thought some were more successful than others."The Dancing Cow" -- a bit boring for me"Mrs Corry" -- despite the charming ending with hanging the stars in the sky, was really rather creepy and weird, with the witchy lady living in a gingerbread house and having fat children (I couldn't help think of HANSEL AND GRETEL)"Christmas Shopping" -- lovely with the stars and Mary Poppins' generosity."John and Barbara's Story" -- achingly sad but so lovely and wise"Bad Tuesday" -- so well-realized in terms of how one can just feel like an awful, angry grump all day from getting up on the wrong side of the bed; and I would have loved the visiting-animals-around-the-world bit as a kid"Full Moon" -- I think this is where the "Mary Poppins is a Satanist" comes from, haha! And, I admit, it was a very, very odd chapter. I was not really a fan and yet, I could appreciate elements and might have liked it as a kid. It's very cool how the animals through a birthday party for Mary. The part with the people in the zoo was very weird and creepy, to me--then again, I think maybe Travers was trying to say how it's not so nice to keep animals in cages, either and I totally dig that message. I wonder if that is why she used snakes as the party-leaders, too--because they ARE so badly viewed by most people and she wanted them to be seen as nice and interesting creatures who love Mary Poppins and whom she loves in return? In any case, it was a very bizarre chapter but I certainly don't think Mary Poppins is a Satanist!!!I think the movie was more magical than the book in a lot of ways--I LOVED the scene where the children snap their fingers to make the room tidy, for example! And I like the family element that the movie highlights--a workaholic dad and his kids who long to spend time with him, realizing what is so important in life and going off to fly a kite together--even if it's a little cheezy, I love it! And Mary Poppins, despite her "spit-spot" stern turns and obvious self-satisfaction (the part where she sings to herself in the mirror--"Cheeky!"--haha!) seems genuinely warm and caring and fun. I'm not sure the Mary Poppins in the book is ever overtly warm or fun, but she is certainly caring in her way and she IS magical in a deliciously mysterious sort of way and I found her endearing. It's so funny how she loves to go shopping because she wants to look at herself in the window reflections--and she is so pleased with her appearance, yet she gives away her favorite gloves to someone more needy. And how she leaves the presents for the children when she goes away. She really does love them and understand them even if she is strict and often condescending and sarcastic. I think the reason she is tolerable in those moods is that the children can see right through her--they are never really afraid of her or embarrassed by her--they know the good in her and nothing else bothers them.read with the Children's Book Group October read -- "classic novels"l
