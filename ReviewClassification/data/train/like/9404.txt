This is one of my Christmas favorites.This story is about a boy whose friend has insisted that there is no Santa, and who is struggling to retain his belief in the "magic" of Christmas. While abed, awake and alert for the sound of a bell from Santa's sleigh, he hears a different sound -- that of a train... a train heading for the North Pole.It's a short book and I don't want to reveal too much, but I will paraphrase a line from the book the line that most speaks for me:Though I've grown old, I haven't let go of the magic -- I still believe!
