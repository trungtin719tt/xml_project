One of the best Newbery books I've read. The characters are super distinctive and Raskin is very witty. An example:Turtle forgot the rules of the court and hurried to her mother."Who did you see, Mom? Who? Who?"(Terrified by the who's, Madame Hoo slipped away.)(view spoiler)[Madame Hoo had stolen the other witnesses's valuables to save money for a return trip to China.(hide spoiler)]5/5 stars.
