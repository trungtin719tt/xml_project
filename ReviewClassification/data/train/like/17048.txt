A STUDY IN SCARLET!!! First group-read for the intact official Non-Crunchy-Sans Pants- for no reason that I can figure out...but none-the-less...NON pants wearing GRs classic reading group.[image error]I read A STUDY IN SCARLET waaaaaaaay back in my younger days- and remembered very little of it. To be perfectly honest- I remembered the title...and reading it- but nothing else. Whether it is my memory...or the fact that it wasn't memorable can be argued- but I liked it. A LOT.[image error]Setting:221B Baker Street, London- 1881A mutual acquaintance introduces: John Watson -physician, and Sherlock Holmes- detective consultant, to each other- both men in need of a room-mate. Thus starting a friendship and working relationship that will most definitely be a formidable pairing.[image error]At first Sherlock's personality is somewhat off-putting (not unlike Dan 2.0's)...but as Watson settles in- he gets used to the detective's unusual ways.Plot:[image error]Scotland Yard detective Gregson asks Holmes to assist him in solving a recently committed crime...and in turn- Holmes asks Watson to accompany him. They travel to an empty house in a London- and there they observe a crime scene that includes: cab prints in the street...footprints in the yard...a dead man who has been poisoned, and the word RACHE- in blood on the wall.[image error]The game is afoot!!!
