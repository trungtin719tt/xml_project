Hello, distinguished review reader. What a nice coincidence stumbling into you here on this expression of thought.Odd chance, you say? Well, I have to be honest with you. I actually planned this for quite a while. I'm playing the long con game with this review.I set up a profile on this site, joined some groups and build a network of friends. And all leads up to today's review.So, I kind of tricked you to lay eyes on these lines of lies.All that I learned from my days with the Gentleman Bastards and their leader, Locke Lamorra. Do you happen to know him?You've probably met him already, but didn't recognize him, cause he was in costume. Maybe he already tricked you into giving him money.He's from the city of Camorr, a beautiful Venice like metropolis, where alchemical lights of all colors are reflected by the famous glass towers in the center of the city.Locke and his friends work their operation from a secret hideout in the bowels of an old temple. But don't bother trying to find it, you would never be able to enter it uninvited.A while back, Locke told me about the Salvara game he and the boys had planned. This would bring in a huge amount of money for the gang, but it wouldn't be the helluva story it is, if all the plans would just work out perfectly. Complications arise everywhere and the Gentleman Bastards are suddenly in all kinds of troubles.What I like about Locke is that, when he tells a story, he tells the whole story. After every part, he illustrates some aspect of the story by giving you a relevant glimpse into his past or Camorr's history.So, long story short, I decided to sign up with the bastards to trick more readers into visting their world.See how they reacted:"I write reviews, cause my train of thoughts after reading a novel can't stay in the station," said Calo."Liar!""I write reviews to impress the ladies with my insight and cleverness!" said Galdo."Liar!""I write reviews to get children to read again," said Jean."Liar!""I write reviews to trick readers into spending money on books," said Locke."Liar!""I write reviews, cause I want people to hit the Like button," I said."Bastard!"
