Everyone loves Calvin and Hobbes. I do, too. It's not just funny, it's also very wise. Tongue-in-cheek philosophy and sociology. Usually the best part of the newspapers that choose to publish it, newspapers that in turn got better per definition than newspapers who don't.But what aboutDonald and Hobbes?Funny, and a little bit scary. Take a look for yourself. :-D
