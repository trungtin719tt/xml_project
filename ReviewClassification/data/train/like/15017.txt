What a cruel, cruel ending... If I were to wait a year to find out what happens to Mac next, I'd be royally pissed right now, because as much as I liked the book, I think this kind of ending is unacceptable and disrespectful to the series' fans.Faefeveris a very dark book and it starts out dark too. I missed Mac's happy-go-lucky attitude and flirtations with Barrons in previous installments. The only relief from the doom we get in this book comes in the form of MacHalo and Druid Voice lessons.Like the previous two books -DarkfeverandBloodfever, there is not much resolution to any big problem/mystery, but there is progress. We learn more about how Unseelie came to life, who imprisoned them and why the walls holding them together are now crumbling. We find out the nature of the Book and what makes it difficult to get a hold of it. We get to know what the Lord Master is.The Fae world is getting more and more complex. There are more players both on human and Fae side, and all characters are interesting in their own way. I am actually quite surprised that an author who previously wrote highlander bodice rippers created such an amazing mythology.But in spite of all these positives, I thinkFaefeveris the weakest in the series structure-wise. It is hard to say what exactly the main story arc of this novel. There is a series of events, many of them dramatic, but the story is unfinished. The ending is vague, the narration stops mid-scene and it calls for a good wrap-up.I am extremely attached to the series now, to Mac and Jericho, and the entire world of Fae, sidhe-seers and Rhino-boys. I will be startingDreamfeververy soon and hope it will not leave me hanging in angst, waiting for the final chapter of this story -Shadowfever- which comes out 6 long months from now.
