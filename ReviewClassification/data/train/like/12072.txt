This book is not for everyone. Readers who don't enjoy The Alchemist of the same author may not want to spend time with this book.I reckon Paulo Coelho's books are not for those who are used to reading non fiction books and more into reason than imagination. But for me, this is an awesome book, full of life, love, and dreams.The book is about a young and beautiful girl who seems to have everything in life, a good job, a good place to stay, parents who love her, boyfriends. Yet she finds life tedious and her heart is full of bitterness. And she decides to kill herself. And she is sent to a mental hospital where weird things happen.It's difficult to understand the logic of the story if you are a "highly effective person", you haven't got the feeling of leading a boring life, doing what people tell you to do, and not living up your dreams. But if you do, you will find the book expressing your hidden voice, a call to freedom, to difference and creativity.Paulo Coelho wrote the book based on his experience living in an asylum in his adolescence. And I found the ideas here thought - provoking:- Some people choose to stay in a asylum simply because they don't want to deal with the outside world full of laws and rules and responsibilities.- Everyone is indeed crazy, but the craziest are the ones who think they are absolutely normal.- You should allow yourself to be a little crazier.It's the right book for me at this moment of my life, trying to escape from routine, figuring out my next step and doing some weird things and seeing where life will take me to.
