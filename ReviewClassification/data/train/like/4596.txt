What a masterpiece!Stephen King has done a lot of scaring through his books but never has he broken my heart like he did with The Green Mile.Even though there were elements of horror, after all, we had an electric chair called 'Old Sparky', this novel felt more like a tale of fantasy at times. I'm sure most people have seen the movie version and in this case it was very true to the book. Still, this poignant piece of horror classic will go down as one of my favorites. This book was flawless and deserves every star!
