Haruki Murakamiwrites novels whose length can put off at first glance. With nearly seven hundred pages,The Wind-Up Bird Chronicleis no exception to the rule. Yet, one understands from the first lines that one will have no difficulty in swallowing it, as one is aspired by the semi-existential and half-existentialist atmosphere that surrounds it.Once again it is a question of following a narrator whose banal life slowly but surely slips into the Symbolist surreal. At first it's only a matter of lost cat and bizarre anonymous phone calls, and then emerge one by one strange characters: a prince of artful media, a young teen dapper and mischievous, two medium sisters to blur aspirations, a wounded veteran of the Sino-Japanese wars... All as many destinies irreversibly changed by the way of the spirit.With his fluid and pure style, the author carries us along in the meanderings of the soul and the sinuosities of history with disarming ease. He delivers us an altered truth that we adopt without any reticence. After all, as he himself says, truth is not always in reality.
