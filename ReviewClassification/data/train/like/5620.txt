This was one of my all-time favorite books when I was a kid. In the story, Grover begs the reader to stop turning pages because each page brings us closer to a monster at the end of the book, and Grover is afraid of monsters. He tries to nail the pages shut, he tries to tie the pages down, he even builds a brick wall. But somehow the reader always turns the page.My mother used to read this book to me, and she was great at doing funny voices. I remember laughing so hard as she acted out Grover becoming more and more hysterical about the monster at the end of the book. (Children's Spoiler Alert: There is a monster, but he is a friendly one.)Somewhere on a flash drive I have a video of my mom reading this story. A few years ago, I showed her the book and asked if I could record her reading it. She performed it perfectly, and it was a beautiful scene.I have so many happy memories of my mother reading to me before bedtime. I am grateful for this book and for those memories. My sweet, brilliant mother. It is tragic that her brain has now been so damaged by cancer that she has trouble speaking and reading, but cancer can't rob me of those times.Like Grover, I wish I could nail down some boards or build a brick wall to try and stop what is inevitable. I just hope there will be some friends there to help me through the scary parts.November 1, 2015
