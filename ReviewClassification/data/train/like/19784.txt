I had tried reading this book several years ago (after I truly loved Redeeming Love), but couldn't get into it. Too many characters with unfamiliar names, the setting and violence was unsettling. I'd been told by several to try again, push through the first chapters. I knew I'd end up reading it, but didn't know when. A few weeks ago, I picked it up again and was reminded why I stopped the first time...but based on several trusted people encouraging me, I pushed through. By the third chapter I was enthralled. The story was unlike any other I'd read, and yet so familiar to me. I became attached to Hadassah...and many others. I'm writing this through big tears in my eyes and I'm torn between starting the next book or letting myself completely mourn some of my 'friends' I'd made in the first. I won't wait long to continue reading, though. I'm officially hooked on this trilogy.
