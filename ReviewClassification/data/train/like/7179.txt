Such a brilliant, devastating work. I haven't read enough drama, but I see how fittingly Arthur Miller has invented set-pieces (that include flash backs and dreams) so that we understand what make the characters tick. Everything depends on what they speak. There is no possibility of an omnipresent voice like in the novels and yet how beautifully Miller brings out the inner life of the salesman and his son Biff! We see the subjugating power of illusions and how utterly difficult it becomes for the salesman to face his reality. When Biff musters courage and in a fit of frenzy charges at his father, we witness the life-long denial finally culminate into a tragedy, the signs of which the title of the book portends from the very beginning. The words from Biff shoot like an arrow and break our hearts: "Pop! I'm a dime a dozen, and so are you!" Continuing further, he says: "I'm not bringing home any prizes anymore, and you're going to stop waiting for me to bring them home!" But we know these words are badly needed. The salesman has to face them before his final departure.In this microcosm, I guess, is the universal story of every father-son conflict (I know I am in a danger of generalizing too far, but I feel that way right now). We could change their profession, we could change the era the story is based in, and yet its soul will remain the same.Also, all the people he thought he had won with a smile and a shoeshine - they didn't attend his funeral.
