To say this book is just a book of murder is to confine Patrick Suskind's words to banality.It is a story of love and obsession. Of one destined to be a captive of the senses.Jean-Baptiste Grenouille is a slave to scent. As some people are captivated by the scent of roses or lilacs, so Jean-Baptiste is captivated by the scent of women. In his dementia, in his lonely mind, he seeks to forever hold this scent of innocence and beauty, so much so it drives him to the brink of insanity, forcing him to commit the utmost atrocities as his mind takes him down a path of darkness from which he will never return. Perfume is a story of the dark recess of the mind, where some madmen dwell for moments, and some dwell forever.
