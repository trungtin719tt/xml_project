Loved this book so, so much. Wish the world could read it, if just once. It's quite difficult not to be stirred by it; the narration welcomes you, like an old friend with a warm blanket and cup of tea. It has a quiet, very human dignity to it - a story as old as Arthur's needs such humanity in order to resonate and be remembered, and White succeeds. Arthur's innocence and patience as well as his frustrations endear him eternally. Lancelot and Guenevere, too, were brilliant and foolish and lovely. Lancelot's struggles in particular made his book an unexpected joy; I finished the Ill-Made Knight the fastest. I loved the philosophy and reasoning as they were included from time to time; they always came about at the right moments rather than appear didactic. The very last chapter broke me, and was the perfect culmination of everything the book is - wonderful and sad, bittersweet and hopeful.It's not a book that should be read in one sitting (or even just once). Like a friend, like an idea, it should grow with you and be revealed and re-visited over time. It isn't preachy, and it isn't boring. It is human through and through.
