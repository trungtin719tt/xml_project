Myriad smallish problems with this one... but several surprising &amp; multifaceted splendors as well!This is an unexpected tome that merges speculative fantasy with true historical events. It does something remarkable in having a target audience that vacillates between YA &amp; the nonFiction prone; in other words, if you are a READER, this one is for you (it's got something for Everyone!).The sex gets racier and racier, but the adventure starts growing tepid. The antagonist is for sure memorable as a, what? serial rapist. But oh, dang, how both women &amp; men, all sexes, wish to have a dual life!I've since ordered the sequel. These books have something Thorn Birds-like in their literary audaciousness. Outlander: it's actually pretty hard to hate!
