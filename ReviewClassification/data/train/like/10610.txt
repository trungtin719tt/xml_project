This was my third read and first listen, and it'sstilla five star read for me. Part of it is my love of Jane Eyre but part of it is just that it's clever, witty, occasionally cheeky, touching, fast-paced, adventurous FUN.The parts of the narrative that cross over with Jane Eyre are done with a great deal of love towards that particular book. Because of this, they feel not only real, but like you're meeting old friends in new and unexpected ways. It couldn't have been done better and I had happy tears in my eyes several times.I highly recommend this book to everybody (and did get my in person group to read it...) for just an action-packed, fun read. I'm sure I'll read it many more times.
