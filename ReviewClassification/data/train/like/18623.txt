"Have you ever said Yes to a single joy? O my friends, then you have said Yes too toallwoe. All things are entangled, ensnared, enamored; if ever you wanted one thing twice, if ever you said, "You please me, happiness! Abide moment!" then you wantedallback. All anew, all eternally, all entangled, ensnared, enamored--oh then youlovedthe world. Eternal ones, love it eternally and evermore; and to woe too, you say: go, but return!For all joy wants--eternity."Someday I'm going to go through my Nietzsche reviews and write something substantial. For now I'll insert my favorite quotations every so often.
