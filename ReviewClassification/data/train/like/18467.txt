Book 25/100 for 2015This was such a cute book! Although this was a pretty long book for a contemporary, it covered the lives of Rosie and Alex from ages 5 to 50 and I remained interested in their story the whole time. I loved these two characters but at the same time I wanted to smack them over the head several times for being so stupid.As for the writing style, it is written in the forms of letters, emails, chat rooms (hahaha who even uses those even more?) and instant messages. This took me a while to get into because at times I felt like it was difficult to understand how much time had passed since the last section and sometimes I felt that I couldn't fully connect to the characters. However, I eventually got used to the writing and it actually made it a quicker read than if it was just plain narrative prose. Also, the epilogue wrapped the story up so well!I had so much fun reading this book and I can't wait to watch the movie with Lily Collins and Sam Claflin (even though I hear it is pretty much nothing like the book).
