I absolutely loved this book! The romance aspect of it was magnificently done, although the exciting, albeit large, book ended way to soon. David and Dr. McNeil were great, but also horrible. For older readers, this is perfectly fine, (in my opinion) but for younger readers, the description of sexual affairs is probably not appropriate. It certainly didn't take away anything for me, though.
