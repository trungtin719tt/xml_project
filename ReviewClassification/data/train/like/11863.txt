Love means you never have to say sorry.That line makes famous from this book. I am quite surprise how short is this book. Even it is short, it is a very beautiful love story. I can see Nicholas Spark takes some leaf from this book. Beautiful honest and not so dramatic.Love it. I wish I can see the movie now.
