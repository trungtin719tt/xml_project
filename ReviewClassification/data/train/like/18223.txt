Re-read: April 20163rd time readingShe knew that the initial feelings associated with love were almost like an ocean wave in their intensity, acting as the magnetic force that drew two people together. It was possible to be washed away in the emotion, but the wave wouldn't last forever. It couldn't -- nor was it meant to be -- but if two people were right for each other, a truer kind of love could last forever in it's wake. At least, that's what she believed.Single mom Denise Holton is driving home one stormy night with her 4 year old son, Kyle. They had been at Duke, because Kyle was having yet another evaluation done. He had been misdiagnosed many times, with the doctors finally settling oncentral auditory processing disorder ( CAPD ). It could be somewhat described as dyslexia of sound...language is all jumbled up for him, for some unknown reason. He has the language ability of a 24 month old.On their drive home, a deer darts into the road, causing Denise to jerk the wheel. They crash headlong into a tree and Denise loses consciousness. She comes to when her car is spotted by volunteer fireman Taylor McAden, who's in the area looking for downed power lines. That's when Denise realizes that Kyle has left the car and wandered away, in the middle of a terrible storm, with nothing around but swamp. Basically a parents worst nightmare, to have their child missing. With Denise unable to search herself due to her injuries, Taylor helps to take charge of the search for Kyle.(view spoiler)[Luckily, Kyle is found by Taylor, safe and sound within a few hours and is taken immediately to the hospital where Denise is so that mother and son can be reunited.(hide spoiler)]Once back into the routine of their normal life, Taylor and Denise happen to encounter each other again and have an undeniable attraction to each other. Taylor though, is living constantly with guilt over something that happened in his past. Because of that guilt, he can't bring himself to fall in love. He's a charmer and seems drawn to troubled woman, rescuing them from the difficulties of their lives, but as soon as they want something more serious from him, he withdraws. Can Denise be the one to rescue him back?This is one of my favorite novels by Nicholas Sparks. It includes Sparks normal recipe for success...small town setting, beautiful woman who is mostly unaware of just how far her beauty goes, hardworking man, a chance encounter turning into love.I think the reason that this one affects me the most though, is because I can relate quite a bit with the MC, Denise.Like her, I too am a single mother ( though I have two ). Like Kyle's, the biological father is not involved. Denise has basically given up her life as she knew it to devote her time to her son. For the duration of this novel, she works as a server in a local diner...I had my children young and because of that, I made the decision to put off my own education until they are older, because I wanted to be able to devote as much time as I could to my children. So I too am a server/bartender, because I can essentially make the money I need without missing the important events and milestones that mark their lives at this point. Like Denise, I've now got a wonderful man who is good to me, but more importantly, is good to my children. Luckily our relationship has progressed without Taylor's demons haunting us.I can relate to Denise with how hard just life as a single mother can be. And the fact that her son has a learning disability makes me realize how much harder it could be. It really makes me appreciate my children, both their good and bad sides, that much more. So this novel has always really affected me. Makes me cry every time.This is the novel that made me fall in love with Nicholas Sparks writing. It was a 5 star read the first time I read it, and it remains one every time.
