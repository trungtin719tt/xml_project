I can't forget her story. It's like a precise etching tatooed on the center of my brain. Her pain is my pain, her fears are my fears, her life...becomes mine. I take every word from her illustrated existance, using it as my own bible to crawl through this enraged wilderness where the grass is made of needles, the trees are crawling with serpants, and the water is too tanged to drink....I taste the saltiness of her tears as they stream down her face, burning, leaving behind scars of inevitable pain. I feel every emotion that blisters her soul. I look deep into her eyes and see the rips in her heart. I touch the engravements on her thoughts. Astrid...I'll never forget your story.I first read this book when I was seventeen for an advanced writing course and it touched some part of me so deeply that I wrote this passage in my journal about it. Since then I've read this book countless times. The story never gets old and the writing is always refreshing.Simply put: The most beautiful piece of fiction I've ever read. Janet Fitch has a truly authentic writing style that incorporates soft hues of poetry into the story. This book will remain on my shelf FOREVER!!!
