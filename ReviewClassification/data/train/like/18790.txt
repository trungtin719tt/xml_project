Wow! My head is reeling. I spent half of this novel in suspense, almost holding my breath, hoping that everything would turn out OK.The Winter of Our Discontentrevolves around Ethan Hawley, a Harvard educated descendant of a wealthy family, who works as a grocery clerk to support his wife and two children. He is complex and fascinating - likable, flippant and so very frustrating.Nobody in the small Long Island town of New Baytown is quite what they seem, and the lines between right and wrong keep shifting. I'm still not sure how to interpret the ending. So I will be pondering this novel for days or weeks. In awe.
