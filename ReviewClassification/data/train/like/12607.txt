Remarkable to think this was DiCamillo's debut novel. With short chapters that gently build towards the right resolution, Winn-Dixie tells the story of a young girl who wants to understand why her mother has chosen not to live with her or her preacher father anymore. As with most of DiCamillo's books, this is a story about healing and love; about the relationship between children and children and adults and the importance of each one listening openly and valuing the other.
