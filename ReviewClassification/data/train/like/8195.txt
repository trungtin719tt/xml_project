This ties To Kill a Mockingbird as my favorite book ever. I've read it 4 times. The movie does it NO JUSTICE whatsoever. I loved the bonds of female friendship, and it was cathartic for me to read it and realize that my mother had a life completely apart and separate from me before she had me, which formed who she was. I was able to do a lot of forgiving when I read this book.
