Updated 12/10/14Oh, poor me, drowning in mysteries. It's still fun to read, even knowing who is what and does what why. It actually shows how well planned this whole series had been.First I want to thankKatfor recommending this series to me. So far it's been exceeding my expectations and I hope it will continue doing so.In this installment MacKayla Lane continues her search for Sinsar Dubh, a powerful Unseelie artifact containing the deadliest Fae magic. She is recovering from the ordeal she experienced at the end of the previous book and at the same time has to face the aftermath of her actions - Inspector O'Daffy is getting very interested in finding out more about the Dark Zone and why Mac is not going back home; Malluce's death is still uncertain; Rocky O'Bannion's brother, Derek, surfaces to poke around in Mac's business; and finally, a mysterious specter keeps following MacKayla around giving her creeps...In my opinion,Bloodfeveris even better thanDarkfever. The Fae world is getting wider, Moning gets us deeper into the lore which is very exciting. We get to know Mac much better and I like her quite a bit. I like her humor and her upbeat personality, I enjoy seeing her grow and change and learn about her abilities. Death-by-sex Fae Prince V'lane is even more mysterious and his intentions toward Mac are unclear. Same applies to Barrons, who is a total enigma. The Mac/Jericho chemistry is off the charts! I simply LOVE these two. Jericho is slowly but surely climbing up the list of my favorite fictional hunks, but he'd better stop roughing up Mac if he ever wants to get to the top of it, because I don't care for this kind of thing.All in all, a great book. It doesn't have much of a resolution in terms of the main story arc (which is not a problem for me), but the minor story arc is as interesting, intense, dark and edgy. I am planning to get my hands onFaefeververy soon.
