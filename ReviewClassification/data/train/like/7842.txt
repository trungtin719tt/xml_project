4.5 starsThis book is nothing short of spectacular. It is insanely well-researched, and it's impossible not to be charmed by Mark Watney's hilarious sense of humor, orjeez-MY-brain-is-filled-with-absolutely-useless-information-impressed by his smarts, ingenuity, and spirit.I will say that after a few chapters, I started skimming some of the more technical parts of what he was doing to survive. I normally love this stuff, and certainly I absolutely DID enjoy much of what was here and sincerely appreciated the amount of research and experimentation that went into his Mark's scientific calculations. But there is a lot of it, hah, and I started feeling a little antsy, even with the irrepressibly funny narrative. SO MUCH MATH.Fortunately, the POV then switches and we start seeing what's happening on the ground and other places. The action-packed plot is streamlined and exciting, the characters are memorable, and overall, the writing is immensely engaging and entertaining.Highly recommended if the summary intrigues you at all, and obviously a must read if you're a fan of science fiction or survival stories. Andthe ebook's only $2.99right now! That's a fucking bargain for the amount of awesome crammed into these pages.So impressed this was a debut--I hope we get many more books by this author in the future. And this is going to make one hell of a movie.
