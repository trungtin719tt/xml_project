Macbethis Shakespeare's darkest play not only because of the restricted palette of its images--shades of black varied with bright red blood--but also because, in the play's world of warfare and witchcraft, its hero is half-damned from the start.Inured to violence, prone to superstition, Macbeth struggles with the hags' predictions in the depth of his soul. But his wife, fiercely ambitious, never struggles. When he is haunted by his imagination, she is steadfast: preparing everything, looking after the details, urging him on. It is only afterward, when he is thoroughly damned, coldly vicious, that she finds she cannot wash Duncan's blood off from her hands.Among other things, this play is the portrait of a good marriage. If, that is, a good marriage can be made in hell.
