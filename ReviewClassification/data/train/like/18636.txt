At the end of1984Winston Smith asks O'Brien why the party acts the way it does. His answer always pissed me off: "Power for power's sake." That's not an explanation. That's a tautological cop out. It's like Orwell was content to warn us about what a totalitarian state would look like without exploring more deeply why it got there. Thanks George.Darkness at Noonexplores this question more fully and in a more honest way. According to Koestler the Soviets were basically a bunch of Raskolnikovs. They believed it right to commit atrocious acts in the name of an idea, namely scientific socialism. They believed the people of their own time would not accept this idea (because they have been shaped by socioeconomic conditions to consider morality which leads inevitably to the status quo, which is slavery) but future generations would see the rightness of their acts. Rubashov, the protagonist, can't see a middle way between considerations of decency and morality and the logic and reason of the Revolution, so he must choose either to betray his principles or go along with his own physical destruction. This is a much more interesting situation than what we're given in1984, with its shallow Manichean setup.
