This book is so significant in attempting to understand the profound effect that war has on an individual. All quiet on the western front is about a man who has just left school, and with his classmates, he is sent to the front line to endure the horrors of war. I have always had an interest in the first World War, as I was never really taught anything about it in school, it was always the second World War that was covered,but yet the first is so important.What I liked about this book in particular, is the way in which we hear the thoughts from each soldier, regardless of nationality. War affects people in different ways, and has such a physical and psychological impact on a person, and this is described in poignant and powerful detail in this book. This was a grim, devastating read, and it definitely toyed with my emotions, but there was something that prevented me from completely loving it and giving it five stars, and I'm not even sure what that was. Even so, I am definitely glad I read this classic.
