The more I read user reviews ofThe Arabian Nights, the more convinced I am that people are just posting negative things to be contrary. How can you not love this collection of stories?Common complaints:1)It's racist -- Yes, the work itself, by today's standards, could probably be considered racist. This work was originally written many thousands of years ago. Keep that in mind and get off your high horse.2) It's misogynistic-- I disagree. That which would be considered misogynistic falls into the category of that described above. Attitudes towards women were considerably different back then. Get off your high horse. Also, the entire book revolves around a woman who outsmarts her captor. Depicting a woman of such high wit and education is hardly misogynistic. The stories themselves are full of women who outsmart the men who suppress them. If anything, the women inThe Arabian Nightscome off as being considerably more worldly than their male counterparts.3) Too long-- It is true that the work is quite long. I might have been better served breaking the book into chunks. Read a few stories, read something else, come back to this so that I could read a few more stories. This strategy might have relieved some of my own "tedium" since the stories get considerably longer as the work progresses. I read the whole work in one stretch. Yes, I got a little antsy to get to the end. But it is a book of stories. It can be split into sections. The book's weight and heft should not be an excuse to pass this one by.Not all of the stories are fantastic. Not all of the stories are even interesting. But this is a seminal work in the history of published writing and its influence is well-earned. Highly recommended.
