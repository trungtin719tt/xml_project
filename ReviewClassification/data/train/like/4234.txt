Though female characters are almost completely nonexistent in this story, I find myself enjoying this book all over again; this could easily be the fourth time I've read this book. There is a certain comfortable, uncomplicated rural Britishness about this story. With all its class divisions and expectations firmly in place, and not questioned at all....Dear Mole and Rat boating along the river on a lazy summer afternoon, Badger's stern, codgery self, and absolutely unrepentantly silly and vain Toad stealing cars entertained me and had me wishing a little that I could visit Mole's tidy and well laid out little home, listen to one of Rat's poems, and have breakfast at Badger's warm, comfortable and wonderful home in the Forest; (Badger's home also felt to me like it was a model for Tolkien's Bag End.)I was also pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed the audio from Librivox.
