This has become one of my daughter's favorite bedtime stories. At the moment she calls the book "Baby bird". She really enjoyed this book since the first time I read it to her. Throughout some parts of the books she laughs and gets sad when baby bid cannot find his mother. She loves it so much she will even attempt to try and read it to her baby doll. I would definitely recommend this book to toddlers and young children. I remember enjoying this book myself when I was younger. It's just an all around great little story.
