I enjoyed this 3rd book in the Ice and Fire cycle where we see Martin's writing mature and his character development deepen. There are lots of memorable moments here and it is mostly the subject of S03 and part of S04 of the associated HBO TV show. I preferred it to its two predecessors but enjoyed the last two books even more.
