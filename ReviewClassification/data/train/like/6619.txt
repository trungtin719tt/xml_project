WOWThis is my usual reaction after reading a Nicholas Sparks book. I adore this Guy's writing .Some may say his book is predictable,But even if it is, i enjoy it .In Dear john , Savannah and john love each other .I thought they were gonna end up with each other but fate had other plans with John going to the army .I loved the character of John,he is not perfect which makes him more real,whereas i cannot say the same about Savannah .At times i thought she was selfish . I found Tim's character very endearing too,(view spoiler)[Even though i was sad for John Tyree , i am happy that Tim ended up with Savannah(hide spoiler)]And like everyone says, "Distance relationship never works" not even in a novel
