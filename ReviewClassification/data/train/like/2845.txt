Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lotBut the Grinch who lived just North of Whoville did not!The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.But I think that the most likely reason of allMay have been that his heart was two sizes too small.Come on, you know the story.In Whoville, live the Whos, an almost mutated sort of munchkinlike people. All the Whos love Christmas, yet just outside of their beloved Whoville lives the Grinch. The Grinch is a nasty creature that hates Christmas, and plots to steal it away from the Whos which he equally abhors. However, things dont go according to plan.It's a short story that teaches the values of love and community with wit, humor, and flawlessly constructed rhymes. It also shows the true spirit of Christmas .Then the Grinch thought of something he hadn't before.Maybe Christmas, he thought, doesn't come from a store.Maybe Christmas, perhaps, means a little bit more!Aww.Everyone;
