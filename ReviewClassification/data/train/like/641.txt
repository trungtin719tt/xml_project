True confessions time: I've read Romeo and Juliet at least once, maybe more (probably it was in one of my college English courses) and mostly thought, great poetry, but GAH! silly kids! idiotic people! I've seen it on stage once or twice -- one production cast Romeo's family entirely with black actors and Juliet's family with white ones, to bring the feuding a little closer to home, I guess. It was interesting, but still, didn't really move me. Though I'm sure I teared up during the final scene, but hey, I'm easy to manipulate emotionally that way. Books and movies make me cry All. The. Time. It's not a major achievement.And then I saw the movieShakespeare in Love(on cable TV, years after it was in the theaters). The movie has Joseph Fiennes and Gwyneth Paltrow doing numerous scenes from R&amp;J together, not to mention a little Dame Judi Dench on the side, which always helps, and I totally ate it up. It hit me right in the heart. Gwyneth Paltrow! IKR?So all of that is to say that yes, Shakespeare is a genius, but sometimes it just takes the right set of actors in one of his shows to make you love it emotionally as well as intellectually. Which reminds me of my favorite actors ever in a Shakespeare production, Oberon and Puck inA Midsummer Night's Dream... but that's a different story.
