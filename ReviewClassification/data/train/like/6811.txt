I really liked this book! I just finished it. About the middle of the book something really shocking happens. I would have never guessed it happened. I almost came into tears some parts of the book was so sad. This is totally a girl book! Romance- Not bad romance. Relationship. Once you read the book you get why The Last Song is such a good title! And why it's The Last Song. The reason for why it's called The Last Song is sad. I decided to give this book a try because I saw the preveiw for the movie and it looked good. I also gave this book a try because Nicholas Sparks wrote one of my favorite movies. A Walk to Remember. Good movie!-Girl movie.
