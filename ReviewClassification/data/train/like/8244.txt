T.S. Eliot has written some of the most thought-provoking poems I've ever read. He is brilliant, just brilliant.You will definitely love Eliot's poetry style if you enjoy the works of Emily Dickinson and Edgar Allan Poe.Some of my favourites:I. The Burial of the Dead.April is the cruelest month, breedinglilacs out of the dead land, mixingmemory and desire, stirringdull roots with spring rain....And I will show you something different from eitherYour shadow at morning striding behind youOr your shadow at evening rising to meet youI will show you fear in a handful of dust.
