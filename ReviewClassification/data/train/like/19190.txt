I read this when it was first published. Just read it again in its new form. It's as fresh and punchy as I remembered it. Actually I liked it more this time. That's the funny thing about books. They're different each time you read them. A BIG RECOMMENDATION for those who'd like a great read about San Francisco and Chinatown and historical mysteries and brilliant color and characters.
