2018 re-read -- dang, it's just as amazing and addictive as when I read it the first time. This time around, I thought about all the ways in which things are still the same or how injustice has transformed. Cassie and her fam are so heartwarming and funny and I love them.I partially re-read this because Angie Thomas said it was one if her childhood faves and the Logan fam definitely reminds me of the Carters.I thinkRoll of Thunder, Hear My Cryis the best book title ever btw. I remember this book from 5th grade, but didn't read it until I was 24. It just stays with you and so does the story and the family and the setting and all of it.
