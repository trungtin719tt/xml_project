I am completely blown away. The Glass Menagerie is a perfect mirror of the dysfunctional American family: An overbearing, yet well-intentioned mother abandoned by her lover; A son filled with Hollywood-style dreams of adventure but living a life of monotonous toil; A defective daughter who has little interest in anything, besides the glass animals she collects--week and frail as herself.The way Tennessee Williams pits all of these characters against each other, and how all of their desires come together and blow up in flames is simply perfect. It starts slow, but for a play so short, it doesn't even matter. Once it gets going, holy cow.
