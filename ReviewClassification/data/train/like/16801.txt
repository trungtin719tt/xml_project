This book surprised, impressed, and in some ways baffled me. What the heck is Shawn Michals doing on an island, where it is revealed he's had a mysterious past? No matter. The story itself pulled me in, as did the character development and the maturation of the Ben Peller/Shawn Michals/Rusty Loury character. No spoiler alerts here, but I was very impressed with the ending. Maybe this character's journey will continue in another "trilogy," but even if this journey is over, I look forward to see if Peller has more books in him.
