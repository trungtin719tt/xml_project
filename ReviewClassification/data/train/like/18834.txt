What a fun read, not great literature but a smart, enjoyable story of relationship awakenings. This had been on my TBR list for a long time because I'm not really into chick-lit, but, I think this was more than that. Just an overall good story of two estranged sisters trying to move forward in their lives after experiencing a pretty rough childhood. It was not sappy at all but there was a pretty feisty apple tree involved and some very quirky characters.As always Susan Ericksen did excellent job narrating, her voices were distinguishable and fit the characters personalities. I recommend this for those looking for a light, feel good read surrounded by small town, Southern hospitality and a bit of enchantment thrown in for good measure.
