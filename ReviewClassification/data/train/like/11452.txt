I'm sad.And I really really really liked this book. It was so AWESOME and full of action and love and grieve and ME CRYING IN MY BED HUGGING IT.This book made me realize that dystopian books never end well enough for me to be happy. This ending was a little like Cassie Clare's Clockwork Princess: A sad happy ending. And I REALLY liked the ending, but oh, it made me cry so much. I think what June decided at the end was really noble, but I don't know, also a little coward? I think Day and her would have overcome all the pain of the past eventually, they would've healed each other. And UGH, then when I saw how many years passed between the last chapter and the epilogue, I WAS FLOORED! SO MANY YEARS! Yes, the ending gave me hope. AND YES, I think Day deserved the chance June got him, BUT BUT BUT--- *le cries again*All in all, I loved this book and I loved the series. I think I'll be rereading it in a few years.
