The best experience I ever had reading a book. I recommend reading it in the winter, but whatever. The winter I read it was the coldest &amp; saddest winter I have ever experienced. The book, taking place in the late 1800's, reminded me that some things cannot ever change with the times: Struggle. Heartbreak. Love. Adversity. Fear. Uncertainty. The human inclination to survive. To name a few. That said, though, this was not a depressing book. Somehow, it gave me an unexpected and strange kind of faith in myself, and perhaps, in the universe in general. Also, Charles Frazier is the only writer who has ever made me attracted to him without meeting him or seeing him. That's saying a lot, in my book.
