Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas To YouSO I HAVE A FEW NOTES ON THIS ONE:-at the beginning, Voldemort says to Wormtail, "I will allow you to perform an essential task for me, one that many of my followers would give their right hands to perform..." OMG J.K. ROWLING FORESHADOWS EVERYTHINGGGG-when the Weasley men come to Privet Drive through the Dursleys' fireplace is just.... priceless. Yet ANOTHER scene that I wish had made it into the movie.-We get to meet Bill in this book (way earlier than in the movies, I might add), and Mrs. Weasley is very disapproving of how Bill looks. I love that Bill stood up for himself and was like NOBODY GIVE AN F HOW I LOOK, AND NEITHER DO IIIIII. It was a nice thing to throw in there.-Dobby is also in this book more, and seeing how different he is was really fun.-Harry and Ron fighting made my heart hurt so much.-All of the drama at the Yule Ball just made me SQUEEE because it's so obvious that Ron and Hermione like each other and they just don't want to admit it and GAH. THE FEELS.-I also love how much Hermione stands up for what she believes in, which you can particularly see in this book. She wants justice for the house-elves, she won't let Ron get away with being an idiot (like when he says he just wants a pretty girl to go to the ball with), and she is especially confident in this book as well. Malfoy and many other people are constantly teasing her, but she is completely above it, and for that I admire her.-WHEN HARRY IS LISTENING TO HAGRID AND MADAME MAXIME AND HE SEES THE BEETLE? IMAGINE IF HE HAD JUST STEPPED ON IT? WOULDN'T THAT HAVE BEEN GREAT?-I completely forgot about the part where Harry sees Barty Crouch on the Marauders Map! He was so close to finding out something big, but then things got crazy and he didn't, but WHOA. SO CLOSE.-Cedric's death hit me a lot harder than it ever has before... He was such an amazing person, and I wish that he could have survived so him and Harry could have been buddies.-VOLDEMORT FORESHADOWS HORCRUXES IN THIS BOOK. TWO MORE BOOKS UNTIL HARRY ACTUALLY LEARNS THOUGH.ok so I think it's safe to say that this is one of my favorites in the series for sure. Probably in the top 3.
