Not sure what to say about this book except it is a fast moving good read that I really enjoyed (five stars!).It's set during an interesting period in San Francisco history, so you learn so history just by reading the story (but it's not a history book!).It's historical fiction, but that does not really matter. It's easy to get a feeling for the times and it does not seem like you've ended up in some foreign world.Full of drama, humor, pathos, and fascinating characters.I guess that is it. If you are looking for entertainment... read it.
