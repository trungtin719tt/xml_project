The Far Pavilions is one of my all time favorite books. I stumbled upon it in a book store because one of the employees had marked it as a must-read. I picked it up and was absolutely enthralled.This historical fiction is reminiscent of Margaret George's books in its character development, dramatic plot line, and, clocking in at more than 900 pages, length. There are battles, romance, and palace intrigue- a little bit of everything. It's one of the few books that I've read more than once and that's saying a lot as I tend to not re-read books. I love it and always recommend it to people who are looking for excellent historical fiction.If you loved The Far Pavilions, I'd recommend reading anything by Margaret George, The Red Tent by Anita Diamant, and Gone With the Wind by Margaret Mitchell. (I wonder why so many Margarets are amazing historical fiction authors? Weird...)
