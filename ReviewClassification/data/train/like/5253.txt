Paradise Lost: the failed divorce of an unhappy marriage?Adam and Eve lived a comfortable yet boring married life that pleased Adam well, but Eve was unhappy with the inequality in the marriage: Why is he enjoying conversations with angels and proximity with God while I stay at home preparing dinner? She enjoyed the love of Adam but gradually she became ever more disinterested in Adam and would rather talk to her own image mirrored in lake.Then one day the unhappy housewife encountered sexy, intelligent Satan in the form of a serpent who encouraged her to eat the forbidden fruit which would elevate her intelligence and make her marriage with Adam more equal. After tasting the fruit herself, she felt that "Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe" so she brought the fruit to Adam who was devastated by his wife's transgression but chose to side with his wife over God, side with domestic happiness over socio-political duties.But soon Adam regretted the transgression and blamed it on Eve:"Out of my sight, thou serpent, that name best befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false and hateful...O why did God, creator wise, that peopled highest heaven with spirits masculine, create heaven with spirits masculine, create at last this novelty on earth, this fair defect of nature, and not fill the world at once with men as angels without feminine, or find some other way to generate Mankind?"After a "Men Going Their Own Way" monologue, Adam recognized that Eve was all he had now, and they decided to repent and stick with their old lifestyle in hope of a better life. Despite mutual dissatisfaction, the marriage continued, but the abyss between them was evident: "They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow, through Eden took their solitary way."Family is a microcosm of society in general, and it is through the dissolution of the institution of a family that humankind lost paradise.
