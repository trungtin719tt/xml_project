Wow, there's a lot about this novel that I hadn't remembered. Like, basically the entire plot, other than the bare-bones outline.I'm going to stick with 4 stars here. Review to come.Initial post:Next up read fromUrsula K. Le Guin: The Hainish Novels and Stories.* This one I read back in my college days, so my memories of it are pretty hazy. The unusual sexuality of the people on the planet Gethen, or Winter -- sometimes androgynous, sometimes male, sometimes female -- has stuck with me, but the plot has gotten lost in the mists of the years. So this'll be almost like reading it for the first time!*I received a free copy of this collection from the publisher for review.
