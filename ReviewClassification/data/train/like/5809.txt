How to attempt a balanced review of Things Fall Apart:1. The book is serious. Themes and issues dealt in the book are far more serious than many other books written by the contemporary authors of Achebe.2. The colonial abstract takes an altogether different turn as Achebe explores that colonisers not only colonised the land and properties but also the minds and hearts of the native people.3. Racism has been dealt very aptly and also religious hypocrisy - different churches for the people who have converted.4. The plot might seem relaxed and lazy (almost) if you ignore the themes and issues. However, the plot is more than enough to keep the 'readers' engaged.DO I recommend the book - yes, of course!
