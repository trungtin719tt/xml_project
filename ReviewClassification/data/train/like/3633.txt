"Tell me exactly what happened. Did you do any heroic acts?""No," I said. "I was blown up while we were eating cheese."What can I say that hasn't already been said?Yes, the man/woman stuff is awkward as hell, with all the "Darlings" and "Say you love me" coming off as so much bad movie dialogue.But, I loved hearing all the characters give their opinions on the war. The action sequences are compelling, and frequently disturbing.And, Henry's repartee with Rinaldi is absolutely priceless!Plus, considering this is a story about war, the book had far more laughs that I was expecting, so here's to you, Papa!I truly enjoyed listening to the audiobook. John Slattery, who is perhaps best known as Roger Sterling fromMad Men, did a fantastic job, and made the book come to life.
