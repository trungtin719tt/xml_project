It always wonders me how we, as an adult, still like children books. That's to say 'I still love them'. When I open a children's book, it seems as if I never fully grew up. I like formost the illogical thinking in it and by that the humour. Peter Pan is one of them. As a belgian I didn't grew up with the famous english children books. So now I want to discover them. My goal for the coming months is to read or reread some famous or less famous childrens books. I am certain I will not be disappointed.
