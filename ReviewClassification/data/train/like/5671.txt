It was such a lovely story! I enjoyed it since beginning to the end. Now it's over, I'd watch the movie soon.I thought of a few of my girl friends while reading it. Without realising, we help each other. Quite often it's just few kind words that we need. To know that someone believes in you, someone roots for you and encourage you - it helps us trudge through. Or simply not go crazy. That's how I'll summarize Ninny Threadgoode and Evelyn Couch's friendship.I loved the world of Ninny which she brings back from memories and so vividly describes to her friend, Evelyn. Must read for those who like old-time charm.
