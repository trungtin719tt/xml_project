This book is a quiet read. Even the drama has a hot, sleepy, summer feel to it. Have a lazy long weekend to just curl up, this is a small and in someways sad, read.I teach this book to my students for lots of reasons. It lets us talk about metaphors and similes. The language is not complicated but it is artistic. I use it when working with predicting texts. Also, and maybe mostly, it's great for some of those big questions if you're having your students reflect upon life and family. What would you do if you could live forever? What about your family? What is a family? Who is a hero and who is a villain? Good choices, safe choices, right choices or bad choices and why? etc., etc., etc.
