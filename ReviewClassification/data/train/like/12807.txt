I had to return this to the library before I could fully finish it, but it gave me some real "food for thought" as they say, when it comes to writing. Borges breaks every writing rule in the book, "Show don't tell", "Center on your protagonist" "Begin with action, not exposition" and shows that the rules are for neophytes to "tolerable-up" their writing, not for a master whose rare gift transcends any finger-waggling from stuffy rule-makers. Borges writes like a fascinating dinner party guest who has been everywhere and seen the most amazing events, recounted in loving, glorious detail and all the more wondrous for being from the point of view of someone humble. He is also so well-read himself, you'll feel there isn't a subject in the world he couldn't discourse on delightfully. I've been taking some risks with my own writing since I read this and I'm grateful to him for rubbing some of the didactic sheen off my eyes.
