This was a delightful, original read to me. This really gets to the core of what reading is about for me - imagining possibilities that we wouldn't otherwise know. This book not only imagines what it would be like to occupy a different person's body every day, but in doing so also shows you a glimpse of life through soooo many different eyes.My favorite thing about this book is that the protagonist is agender - specifically describing themself as not quite male nor female exactly. Which also makes A's romantic plot a queer love story. Even though the language that the characters use to describe sexuality/gender is clumsy, and would turn me off by itself, the added context of A's description of their gender makes this a subtle but definitively genderqueer read for me. I'm really happy to have this kind of representation.
