What fun! An alternate history universe where people are so invested in literature as to fight over it, such as the damnBaconians saying he wrote Shakespeare's playswhen it's obvious that he couldn't have (Thursday cogently argues this at one point.) &amp; whole societies devoted to various authors. There are no planes, just 'gas bags', but there are cars &amp; guns. Other things vary, such as Wales is a separate Communist state &amp; the Crimean War is over a century old &amp; still going strong. England also has quite a number of Special Branches keeping the peace.Our heroine, Thursday Next, is a member of Special Branch #27 for literature. She's self-effacing, has an extraordinarily complicated personal life, a pet dodo (version 1.2), a father on the run from the Chrono cops, &amp; a slightly mad inventor for an uncle. (The dodo complicates her life very little.) She's veteran of Crimea &amp; was a cop for a while, so when Acheron Hades starts threatening literature, she's tenacious in tracking him down &amp; setting things back to rights despite all.If you're familiar withJane Eyre, you might think you'll know what happens. Well, you'll have a clue, but it probably won't happen the way you think. I chuckled often as the plot twisted wonderfully. Very well written &amp; read. I'm planning on listening to another soon. Highly recommended.
