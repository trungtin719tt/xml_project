Let it be known that, despite seeming evidence to the contrary in the form of my reviews, I do indeed have a sense of humor. True, it is a small and desiccated thing, unusual in its feathering and tending towards the qualities of the morbid and the sadistic. However, it delights in incongruity to the extreme, and what makes it laugh will win its love forevermore.This book could have simply tickled my fancies to the bone and nothing else and would still have won me over in a complete state of adoration. Instead, it made me cherish each moment of delicious hilarity ever the more by counterbalancing every one with insight of the deepest sincerity and resignation, to the point that if there had not been a humorous note to it all I would have been left as many of the more viciously truthful pieces of fiction have done: riotous, rumpled, and severely disturbed. That particular state is all very necessary to personal growth, but really, is it too much to ask to be able to laugh while painful pieces of existential clarity are being thrown at you pell-mell? I don't think so.What are these dreadful words of wisdom about, you ask? Gender, for one, that whole massive construct theorized by and for the dominant of the binary, one which we need not name but will simply point out that the majority of them would improve by sustained bouts in the shoes of the other side of the equation, preferably in a dress so as to take full advantage of that marvelous pursuit of 'cross-dressing'. The pettiness of power in the name of 'truth', the omnipresence and inclusive existence of many of said 'truths', the fickle tapestry of memory, the bendings and breakings that each and every time period wreaks on its inhabitants, the rapid interplay of opinion and perception and the brief and oh so few movements when the two coincide in empathetic harmony, the decriers of the current age whose ancestors bemoaned the invention of writing and whose descendants will frown on marvels that we modern denizens cannot even imagine.Most of all, majorly of all, that invention of writing and all that it truly entails. The chaos, the heartbreak, the absurdities, the ridiculous conceptions of meaning in every word and phrase, the overwhelming realities of making a living off of one's prose, the absolute demands that writing makes on the writer, the cutting up and laying out and stitching up of the soul in every slice and spot of ink, the exhilaration, the wonder, the joy. All of it, wrapped in some of the most gorgeous prose the world has ever known.For once the disease of reading has laid hold upon the system it weakens it so that it falls an easy prey to that other scourge which dwells in the ink pot and festers in the quill. The wretch takes to writing.Oh tragic day, that I ever took up a book and began to think. Oh rapturous pleasure, that I ever took up a pen and began to write. Oh unknown future, that I have yet to see unfold before my eyes and beyond my soul, if nothing else, let me laugh. Just a little.
