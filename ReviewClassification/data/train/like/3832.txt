SLIGHT SPOILERS(and excessive Twilight references)I will start with my usual and often spotting of unusual things on front covers of books. Here on the cover of Last Sacrifice we have whom I am assuming is Rose Hathaway. Well my dear - YOU NEED TO PLUCK YOUR EYE BROWS. Sorry, Im a stickler for hairy eyebrows.Today instead of a review, I will give somewhat of a speech. Some dedications if you will.I have waited what seemed like an eternity to read Last Sacrifice. I cant believe its now over *sniffs*. Its hard to believe that this was only the second series that I ever picked picked up. Second being after Twilight. First impressions - I didn't like it. But I continued reading the series and fell in love.TO DIMITRII love you. You have it all. Height, beauty, body of a god, fighting sills and the hottest female guardian hanging on your every whim. But someone needed to give you a firm back hand! You were stubborn with Rose and took WAY to long to realize that she was everything that you wanted.TO ROSEYou are the most kick arse chic on the planet! You saved the day AND got the hottest guy in the sack *HIGH FIVES*TO ADRAINI thought you took your break up with Rose horribly. You went ape shit on her. But then again I guess that is a normal teenage boy reaction, right? But come on! Even Jake fromTWILIGHTdidn't chuck that big of a tantrum when Bella ultimately went back to Edward.TO LISSAOr should I say ' Your Majesty ' - huh, talk about captain obvious.I would like to round up my 'speech' with a few small words.I know that like Edward v Jake there are also Dimitri v Adrian fans. But also like Twilight the story would always come down to Rose and Dimitri. It was ALWAYS about them, and they deserved their HEA.P.s Only thing that got me down was the ending with Adrian and Rose. I would have liked more of a understanding between them. It was abrupt and harsh and once Adrian left, what happened then??
