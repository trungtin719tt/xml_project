I picked this book up at this particular moment for a reason. While I've really liked, even loved, several of the books I've read so far this year, I haven't really felt blown away by anything. I was looking for something that was going to blow me away, and I thought this book might fit the bill. Luckily for me, I turned out to be totally right.This book succeeds completely on two levels. On the one level, if you want to learn about what was happening in Sudan in the eighties and nineties, this book will tell you pretty much everything you need to know. But fortunately, for all the information that's imparted, Dave Eggers doesn't forget that his book must also work as a novel, and it does. It really, really does. The book is longer than it looks--more than 500 pages--but they go by swiftly. I can't remember the last time I got this absorbed in a book; I would forget my surroundings entirely, and given that I was reading a lot of it on rush-hour trains and crowded train platforms, that's really saying something.I think my experience of reading this book made me understand what people mean when they call something an "instant classic." That term has always seemed like hyperbole to me--after all, the whole reason books are considered "classics" is because they stand the test of time; there's nothing instant about it. But I truly believeWhat Is the Whatis going to be one of those books that's still being read decades from now. There's really no excuse for not reading this at some point. Very highly recommended.
