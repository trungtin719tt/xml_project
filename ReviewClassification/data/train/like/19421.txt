Eleven year-old Melody has cerebral palsy. She lives in a world of silence-- unable to talk or write. Although she is extremely intelligent, her classmates and more than a few teachers, see her as simple-minded. When Melody receives assistive technology that allows her to communicate, she finally proves to everyone that she is smart. Melody longs for acceptance, but events beyond her control throw Melody into conflict with her classmates. Touching and honest, the resolution of this conflict is realistic, and does not end perfectly for Melody.From the first page, Melody's thoughts and experiences show that language wields the power to free, crush, or illuminate the human spirit.I am predicting many awards for this book in the upcoming year. Read it before everyone else finds out about it.
