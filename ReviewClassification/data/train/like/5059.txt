This book is everything I ever wanted. It's a book about a book and lovers of books. It's very self-affirming for me. Now I don't feel like a COMPLETE goober for 1) smelling books 2) learning Elvish or 3) bringing at least 5 books with me everywhere I go.Note: just because I don't FEEL like a complete goober, does not mean I am not one."Inkheart" is the first in a trilogy. "Inkspell" is already out, and "Inkdeath" will be out in 2008.You may not love "Inkheart" in and of itself; however, if you are a lover of books, I find you will at least appreciate the characters and the sentiments within the pages if not like the story as a whole.
