I love this book..............My earliest memory of this book is my mom reading this aloud to my two year old self, and crying as she finished the last few pages. Now im the one who starts crying whenever i pull the book out and stare at the waterworn pages.Anyone who's read this book knows the words that the mother is constantly saying to her son as he's sleeping-I love you foreverI'll like you for alwaysAs long as I'm livingMy baby you'll be.My mom made a tune for those words, and I cant imagine those words without the song. It was my little lullaby when i was younger.
