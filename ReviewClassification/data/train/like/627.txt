WOW. WOW.... no really, just wow. Could not put it down... and I CAN'T STOP THINKING ABOUT IT!One of my favorites books this year, no question about it!I've been trying to write this review for the last two hours... and nothing is coming to mind but "AWESOME" and "WOW" and "WOW".... did I say wow? I apologize that this review is going to be incoherent, and mostly fangirly, but that's the state of mind this book has left me in! I'm in shock of its spectacular-ness. Is that even a word?I'll admit it, it was the cover that first drew my attention.... I read the summary and my first thought was, meh. Yes, I'll admit it, meh. Then I started hearing all the hype. When I went to a signing, in March, a few bloggers were talking about how fantastic it was. I'm always leery of hype for some reason.Needless to say, I picked it up, and I'm SO GLAD that I did. You should pick it up too!There are many things that make this a great book. The story, the characters the writing. It wasn't just one thing that stood out to me, this was a perfect mesh of all the things that make a book unforgettable.When I talk about connecting with characters, this is the type of book I'm talking about. I don't mean, connection in a way of relating to them. I mean connection in a way that these characters meant something to me, that I felt their pain, their happiness, their despair. I cared what happened to them. That's what connection means to me. Divergent gave me that and so much more.What a talented author. What an unforgettable book.If you didn't buy it yesterday, go get it today.
