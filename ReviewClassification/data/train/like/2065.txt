All the stars!Loved, loved this book!I'm not sure what to say in this review that hasn't been said by others. I was blown away by how great this book was. It was so much better then the movie!The slow progression of insanity with Jack Torrance was one of the best things about this book. I loved the overall menacing presence of The Overlook. I loved how the hotel becomes more violent and threatening to Danny and his family the longer they stay there. It was so gripping and overwhelming as the story unfolded. You just couldn't quit reading!I enjoyed Danny's struggle as a kid with understanding his 'gifts' and how to use them in a positive way.Danny, don't you dare go into room 217!This whole book was just awesome! This review doesn't give this book justice for how great it is. I recommend this book to Stephen King fans and horror lovers.One of the best books out there! GO READ IT!
