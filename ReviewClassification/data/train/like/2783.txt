I am surprised by how much I liked this one. This was my first Nicholas Sparks read and after years of it being recommended to me I finally gave in.I expected a by the numbers, cliche, love story. And it was in a way, but the characters were great and so the journey was great. And sad.You know where this is headed from the very beginning in a way, but it still surprises you at points.And no, I did not cry... I think... Maybe... Manly tears only...
