White Oleanderfollows the story of Astrid, a young girl who is shuttled from one foster home to another while her mother serves a life sentence in prison.I'm reading this for the second time, and it remains one of my favourite books ever. It is as beautiful and dreamy as it is bleak and raw. The Los Angeles setting is gorgeous, blissful, and yet terribly unforgiving. I was so totally immersed in this story from start to finish, and I would think about it longingly when I was off doing other things - which is what I love most about reading; it's such a wonderful feeling when you can't wait to dive back into the world between the pages.The characters in this novel are ones you won't forget; terribly flawed, and yet I remained sympathetic towards all of them. Janet Fitch has a talent for writing in a way which allows you to thoroughly comprehend what each character is going through, regardless of how different your own life may be.I highly,highlyrecommend this novel, especially for those who love character driven stories, or if you're looking for something different.White Oleanderis truly remarkable.
