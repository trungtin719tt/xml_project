Some time ago, I remembered seeing a portion of theFahrenheit 451film. So, I knew something about the story before reading the novel. However, I discovered far more than I expected.My thought was that the firemen in the novel burn books with no idea or knowledge of their contents. However, in the case of Captain Beatty, this turned out to be false. He knows what is in books (many books) and can quote them at length. His mindset is a reminder that knowledge can be rewarding but also unsettling. We can suppress our unsettling doubts or seek to resolve them.All in all, the novel is a great read. It incorporates some of the themes found in later dystopian fiction and films. Highly recommended.
