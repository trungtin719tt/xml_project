Yes, I know this is Dreiser and I have heard all the caveats against reading him...His mundane style and his need of an editor...the pounding over the reader's head with his points...I was unprepared for the power of this prose to be sure.But the story overwhelmed me. The character of Clyde became real for me. I have known so many people like him...young, vaccilating, dreaming of better things, chafing at the position in life to which they have been placed by an accident of birth and susceptible to flattery and vice because they are bored and weak and run down by a drab life. This book was written in the early 1920s and the portrayal of the human condition is certainly not dated.There are many who will write a more detailed, lucid and knowledgeable description of the merits of this book (or the demerits). I will simply urge those of you who have never read this classic example of 20th century realism to give it a go.Clyde is not a hero. He can be despicable, irritating and frustrating. By why don't I detest him? This is a question I still ask myself after finishing the book months ago. I found myself rooting for his character to, literally, get away with murder (and the murder of a very nice person, too.) The last portion of the book is especially gripping as we learn Clyde's fate.An American Tragedy was an emotional rollercoaster. As Clyde's story unfolds we are witness to scenes of drab poverty, lavish luxe life, the cheap thrills of brothels and booze ups in the big city, the bucolic amusements of mid 20th century rural life, the power of lust and greed, but also of faith and love and the fact that we have no choice but to go on until the end...whatever that end might be.This book was a panarama...the story of a life...and one worth reading.
