Excellent book!Grinch hates Christmas and he has this wonderful, awful idea of pretending to be Santa Claus and to steal all the decorations and gifts and Christmas trees and their food for their feast from the Who-ville.You see, his heart was two sizes too small...But the good thing is that nobody is Who-ville cared that their decorations and gifts and Christmas trees and their food for their feast were stolen. They were just happy because they could sing together.And that made Grinch's heart grow three sizes! Wow!
