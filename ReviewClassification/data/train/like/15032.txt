This book had some ground to make up to begin with because after checking its copyright date, all I could think was, "It's a book...about a magic apprentice...in England...written after Harry Potter." And that meant that I was skeptical, although not to the degree that I thought the main character would be named Barry Cotter or something.Well, there is one big way in which it's like Harry Potter......I stayed up all night reading it.This is a FANTASTIC book, one that suggests that Harry Potter books don't have to be just a phenomenon, but could be a genre as well, as long as there are people out there who have the capacity, as Jonathan Stroud does, to create new worlds. While Harry Potter may always be on the top of the heap (better protagonists), don't make me choose between Dobby and Bartimaeus; it will only end in house-elf tears.Now, Stroud's magical rules, the key to success in the genre, are simple, spirits control magic, magicians control spirits. Now, if Krazy Christians thought Harry Potter was warping little kids' minds, then I'm surprised they haven't caught on to this series, with its pentacle circles and summoning "demons."The plot works, though between action, it can slow down considerably, but the magical scenes are pretty fantastic, and, while HP has managed to sadden me on occasion, this book was the first that scared me with its monsters.But the jewel in the crown is Bartimaeus. While I imagine writing books can be hard for some people, writing a character like Bartimaeus must make Stroud love his job. Barty's sarcastic, powerful, arrogant, informative, and all in all, seeing the magical world through his asides and footnotes makes the book. Unlike early Harry Potters, Stroud does not provide explanations of magic with a lengthy paragraph. Instead, our teacher is the salty djinni, who wise-cracks his way through our magical education.All in all, his character would be worth the read, but all of the magic created by Stroud delights. You'd be surprised how original someone can be post-Hogwarts.
