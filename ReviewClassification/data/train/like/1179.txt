Jacob Jankowski is now in his 90s under care in a home. His mind travels back to the time he copes with tragedy when he loses his parents in an accident. It forces him to drop out of college while studying to be a Vet, and jump on a train. As it turns out he has landed in a circus train. What follows are his experiences in the circus. There is Arthur who is merciless and self centered. His wife Marlena whom Jacob follows in love with. Then there are the animals, especially the elephant Rosie.The circus environment is well researched and very realistic - be it the way animals are trained to perform, including cruelty many times or how the performers make their living....However the story line is very predictable and the characters are not too well etched. You do feel for the elephant Rosie though.This book had incredible promise with it's circus scenario but falls short with characterization, story and pace. But it is still worth a read without having very high expectations.....
