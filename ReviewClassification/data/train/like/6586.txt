This series keeps getting better and better! i think what makes this series so enjoyable for me is the fact that I love the narrator in the audiobooks. I feel like if I didn't have that like for him I might not enjoy the books as much but I love them dearly.The world this author has created is so intricate and detailed and every character is so well written and developed that I applaud his writing.I think Eldest is still my favourite so far of the 3 I've read, but I really enjoyed Brisingr.(view spoiler)[One little tiny problem I have with this series is the inclusion of Rorin and Katrina's romance.(hide spoiler)]It seems really out of place to me. I don't really like the inclusion of it and to be honest I don't see the purpose to it. I just find myself not caring about it as much.Love this book though and I am starting Inheritance right away!
