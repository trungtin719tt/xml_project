Such a wise-cracking djinn, such a tiny, jerkish upstart. You will absolutely devour this book. It's hilarious. Told from the very different viewpoints of Bartimaeus ( a smart-aleck djinn who has lived thousands of years and has nothing to show for it but an I rock you don't attitude) and Nathaniel (12 year old jerkwad apprentice whose lifelong dream is to be a huge im portant government official and have millions of obedient djinn slaves at his fingertips. Bartimaeus isn't making it easy for him) this book is a full of humor and helps us to know the true meaning of friendship a little better. Even if the friends sometimes hate each other for a while. This unlikeliest of pairs will do their best to undermine a conspiracy against the fat, lazy, corrupt government and share a few moments that will make you laugh out loud in the process.
