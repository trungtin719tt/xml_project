I'm surprised that d'Artagnan and his three friends in so many people eyes are heroes and "good" guys. Because they are not. Author has made cruelty, crime and sinful deeds OK if its done by "inseparable" friends and cloaked it in heroism and gallantry.I had a lot what-the-heck moments. Almost every chapter.The book is full of "Duma's occasional lapses of memory"However the story is interesting and the book is a true page turner.
