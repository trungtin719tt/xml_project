I am spoiled at the moment with my literary discoveries !! I once again enjoyed George Eliot's Middlemarch, a pavement of nearly 1000 pages, a fantastic story of a small village in England where the destinies of several locals meet and where from the very first pages we embark In a great adventure!The novel focuses on several couples: Dorothea Brooke and M.Casaubon, a boring ecclesiastic, followed by Dorothea and Will Ladislaw, whom we follow throughout history; the unhappy marriage of Tertius Lydgate, an ambitious but touching doctor, with Rosamond Vincy, a vulgar young woman wishing to arouse the admiration of all her neighbors; finally, the couple Fred Vincy/Mary Garth, whom I most appreciated ...In addition, the characters are all more interesting than the others, offering a variety of characters among the individuals that the reader has the chance to meet ... Personally, I preferred the character of Dorothea Brooke, so endearing through her choices, the difficult moments of her life, her generosity to the doctor Lydgate for example, and finally, access to happiness at the end of the novel ... I also liked all the male characters, including M. Lydgate, Will Ladislaw or Fred Vincy.Finally, George Eliot depicts the society of her time down to the smallest detail, which allows us to participate in some animated discussions, or to take part in scandals upsetting the village and its surroundings ...So I loved this wonderful novel by George Eliot, which despite some flaws (though very rare) is obviously one of the greatest of English literature.
