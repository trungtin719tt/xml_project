Possibly my favourite Bronte novel, the semi-autobiographical story of Lucy Snowe - strongly resembling Jane Eyre - who takes a post teaching at a girls' school in Brussels, there she meets with wilful pupils, an overbearing head teacher and also the possibility of love. Beautifully written, haunting and engrossing novel, which deserves to be as widely read as 'Jane Eyre.' Although devotees of romantic 19th century novels may find the ending problematic.
