I think I may have enjoyed this book the most so far. Sookie is finally beginning to figure out that she doesn't need a man around to be happy. She's showing some independence. Now, if she could just stay out of trouble! Sookie has to go to New Orleans to go through her cousin Hadley's stuff that was left to Sookie after her death. Quinn is back in this book and I just adore him. He gets caught up in Sookie's problems though, and finds himself kidnapped and beaten along with her. Sookie finds out a secret in this installment and it blew me away as well. So sad. And it took me awhile, but I figured out who was behind the attacks against Sookie. The author once again introduces many new characters who are all great pieces to the puzzle. So unique and interesting.
