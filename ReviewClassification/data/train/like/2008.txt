Reread: 2015Because some Non-CrunchyCoolClassic Pantaloonless friends thought I read it wrong...Turns out, Idid. This was a really good mystery!{insert long-winded apology with much groveling}Happy, guys?The story goes a bit like this:10 strangers each get invitations fromsomeonetheythinkthey know, to stay on an island resort. Hells yeah! Sunshine &amp; sea air!Well,resortis a bit of a misnomer.It's really a big house on an island. Still, it's famous for being a party place, and nobody in the group turns it down.BIG MISTAKE.Almost as soon as everyone is gathered together, a recorded voice booms out through the walls and accuses each of them of being a murderer. And not just...YOU'RE ALL MURDERERS! Nope, whoever it is appears to know specific details about each death, and why these particular people were responsible.Of course, everyone immediately starts proclaiming their innocence!Wha..? Noooo! That person died accidentally! I was never even a suspect! Who dares...?! Harrumph &amp; bluster!However, within minutes one of them falls over dead.Suicide? Or something more nefarious?!As the body count rises, they have to face the facts that these aren't accidents. And with each new death coinciding with a children's rhyme that's tacked up in each room, all signs point to a self-appointed executioner in their midst.After they get organized and take a peek around, they realize that they are quite alone on this island. Their mysterious benefactor must be disguised as one of the guests, and is more than likely...the murderer.Dum, dum, duuuuum!The tension ratchets up with each body, and the guests start turning on each other in an attempt to ferret out the killer. Eventually, they decide they just need to calm down and survive till the police can get to the island.Good plan, right?But what if there isn't anyone left to tell the cops what happened?So whodunit?I ain't tellin'.Psst. The epilogue is really important.
