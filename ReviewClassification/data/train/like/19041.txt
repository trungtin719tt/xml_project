Continuing my friendship with Anne with the third book in the series, I had the same surefire calm vacation experience as I've done reading the ones before. There's not much to be said about a new Anne book - other than the fact that if you've enjoyed one of them, you'll probably enjoy another too. There was only one thing slightly off in this one for me - it's supposed to be a book about Anne in college. And yet - Anne's college goes by without... any college. I feel like we don't hear about it at all. It's just her life during the summers and her house.(view spoiler)[And what's this about killing dogs and cats?..(hide spoiler)]However, I have to admit that the romance isabsolutely perfect!I'm not a romance reader, so I thought Anne and Gilbert's love story to be done absolutely perfectly in its modesty and minimal approach. It's just so heartwarming, true and cozy. Just what I would have imagined for Anne!This review does not feature on my blog, but if you want more recommendations and bookish posts, please visit:My Blog|My Bookstagram|My Bookish Twitter
