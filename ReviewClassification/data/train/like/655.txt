Years after I read this masterpiece, it is still chilling.Golding spins a yarn that could have been told centuries ago, primal human nature unmoored from civilization does not take long to break away and devolve into a feral thing.As good today, and as haunting, as it was when it was published in 1954. This should be on a list of books that must be read.** 2018 addendum - it is a testament to great literature that a reader recalls the work years later and this is a book about which I frequently think.
