*** 4.40 ***I read this in one breath... Mercy and her battle for survival after some of her choices, which are never well thought out but always deeply felt, kept me up most of the night. This time it is the Fae friend who is in trouble and Mercy's devotion to those she calls her friends once again lands her in some deep and dark waters... Some times literally... This same loyalty is what makes me fall more and more with this character - she is everything I think a good UF leading lady should be - emotionally strong, loyal, smart, but at the same time not invulnerable, quite disadvantaged when it comes to magic and physical strength when it comes to her very powerful enemies... Well, with every book the stakes on her safety are raised and she takes more blows both physically and emotionally... By the end of the book we wonder if she will ever be strong enough to live through her latest adventures...I do not want to give anything away - the fun of reading these books is the tension that comes with not knowing how things will progress.. . The books continue being written in the classic Urban Fantasy stile and I do believe they get better with every new issue. Patricia Briggs is a gifted story teller and I like diving in the pool of her creativity despite it not being as flashy or frantically paced as some of the newer books out there... I am a fan and am impatient to finish this review and get into the next volume. So, as always, happy reading to all!!! :-)
