O man, I still think about this just about every time I button a shirt. I believe it influenced my decision to avoid having a large family.Y'know, it's interesting growing up in a town of 1100, with a mother who didn't buy many books because, after all, we did have a free library. Sure, I guess the adult section was well-enough stocked to keep her busy in the time she could spare from the three of us. But there are *so many* children's books I missed out on. And so many I read over and over again. And also some adult books I found to read and reread, like this, andRobert Benchley,Emily Kimbrough, andJames Thurber, etc. I wonder if this will hold up now that I'm approaching empty-nest....
