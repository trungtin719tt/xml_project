This is one of those classic epic historical novels that were churned out in the 60's, 70's and 80's. One is reminded of The Shogun, the Robert Elegant novels, Herman Wouk, James Michener, to name a few.Here the location is India during the Raj in the 1800's, adventure, battle and forbidden romance, with history of the times thrown in.They don't write them this way any longer, or perhaps I just haven't come across one.If you enjoy historical fiction don't miss this one.
