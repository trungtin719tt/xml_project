I wasn't sure what to make of this book at first, because I typically don't read children's or middle-grade literature, whatever category you would slot this book into. I also didn't have really any idea of what it was about, but the beauty of the book itself made me decide to give it a try - and I as not disappointed!The book follows a young orphan called Hugo Cabret, who lives inside the walls of the Grand Central station in Paris, mending clocks and stealing toy parts from a local vendor. When he is caught by the toy vendor, he becomes enveloped in a mysterious world of automatons, movies, and magic.What I loved about this book was the second part, which is where it really kicked off for me and captured my full attention. I adored the inclusion of cinema and old film photos/drawings, which was something I wasn't expecting at all, and I loved the fact that I could engage in both my love of cinema and literature while reading one book. The illustrations that Brian Selznick does himself are also really well done - they are all done in pencil, so at times it can be a little hard to see what is going on, but the facial expressions of his characters are beautiful, and he beautifully represents the streets of Paris and the busyness of the station itself.I would highly recommend everyone check this book out, even if it's not normally something you would pick up. It's a work of art, so get the physical edition, and just allow yourself to be enveloped in a magical, fun-filled story. You won't regret it.
