im just rating this 4 stars because of its complexity, but not for the contents of the book, witch can rightfully be called a piece of art, this has to be the most complex read i had in years, it's a beutifully explained book on evoulution of especies by natural and human selection, it is incredibly detail and meticulously explained, for maximum enjoyment you must know selections and natural order to fully understand this book as well as geography and different science studies, the variety of especies mentioned in this book is very wide and unless you have a picture of each especies or variety you would be fairly lost, this not a book to take easily as i wrongly did at first but it's an stupendous read if you love science, it is very heavy and will challenge you to finish it and is up to you if you do it, for me it is a really complex read but a fulfilling one in the name of science.
