Welp. I did it. I finally diddly-dun-did it. I caved. I got a hold of the complete audiobook set read by the lovely Stephen Fry and dove right in. (Sidebar, I haven't had the slightest desire to actually read these past several months; audiobooks have become my solace lately.)As someone who only saw the movies--never having grown up with the books since I wasn't a reader as a kid--I was surprised how very few differences there were between the books and movies. The books felt like much more in-depth and immersive experiences while the movies were the equally gorgeous yet more condensed visual counterparts.There's really nothing else I can say about a series that has achieved such legendary status. I was always curious to find out if it really was as incredible as it had always been gushed about to me and, well, yeah. It is. This series is the real deal.And Rowling is most definitely the real deal. Bow down, bitches.
