Loved it! There was so much intense action and emotion in this book that reading it was exhilarating for the most part of it. The story is constructed very well, the simple and slick writing doing its part in making the book a joy to read. The initial build-up to the actual story, the story of White Fang, a wolf-dog, was amazing. I felt immersed in the world the author so wonderfully created.This story mixes in a lot of dialogue and arguments that we generally come across when there is a discussion between people on the topic of animal rights. The author sort of plays on these arguments and sentiments as he weaves them into the story of wolves, their lives and their interactions with human species. There were a lot of moments which were profound in regards to the humans' relationship with wild animals. The author makes a curious and probably a symbolic choice of telling us that the wolves see humans as Gods, as in, humans are far more superior than themselves and that humans can do things the wolves dare not dream of. This choice makes a noticeable change in the effect the story has on the reader and for me personally, makes the underlying theme even deeper than it already is.The story of White Fang itself, from its birth till the end, was a gruelling, touching and fierce journey and most of its trials and tribulations are a result of the insensitive cruelty of man, to whom he surrenders and gives his fealty. Many a time I found that someone around me was cutting onions, so I had to close the book and my eyes for some time before resuming. This story was as epic as it was endearing.Heads-up to animal lovers: There is a lot of animal cruelty in this tale and it's painful to read. But the good thing is that it also shows, very beautifully, the special bond humans and dogs share - love and loyalty.
