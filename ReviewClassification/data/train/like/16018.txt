i would never have expected to like this novel, but i LOVE it. I liked the movie a lot, but it isn't one i'd watch again, especially. The book is really well written, very intelligent and full of real emotion. It's very moving without making you feel depressed. Evans obviously did a LOT of research before writing this book, the kind of research you do with real people, not with library books or online searches, but he mixes all this information in with the storyline so skillfully that you feel like he MUST have been a Montana cowboy at some point...Anyway, this is a lovely book and is especially wonderful for mothers and daughters. I read it while my mother was in her last days, and while my daughter was/is sick with a mysterious ailment; and even though I felt (as I always do with movies and films) that the parents and children resolved their insurmountable problems too easily... at the same time, i was happy and encouraged for them that they did. I mean, i really felt like they were real people. Also, his descriptions of an angry teenager (which are paralleled by his descriptions of angry, petulant horses)are spot on.He also is very funny and tosses out little descriptions or word combinations that make you laugh, and which surprise you because you were otherwise so caught up in the emotions of the story and the beauty of the landscape he paints.****I wrote most of this review before I'd read the last few chapters, and i'm sorry to say it does deteriorate quite a bit at the end. Where everything else in the book feels very "true," the end is kind of unsatisfying and lazy. Nonetheless, it's still worth reading!
