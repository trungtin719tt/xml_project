Flow Down Like Silver is a story set in ancient Alexandria when the Mediterranean world was at a cross-roads between traditional beliefs and philosophies, and the newly dominant Christian faith. The star of this remarkable novel is Hypatia, among the most accomplished and fascinating women in history. Her story, told by another of my favorite authors, Ki Longfellow, captivated and intrigued me. I did not know much about early Christianity or the Roman world of this period, before reading this book, so I learned a lot. It was great to be absorbed in a page turner, and come away feeling like I had learned something as well.
