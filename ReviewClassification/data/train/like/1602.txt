I finally decided to bite the bullet and pick this series up. I'll be honest, I did not expect to enjoy this as much as I did!So easy to read and Rose was a spunky, outspoken heroine and I love that Richelle Mead wasn't afraid to make Rose so sexually confident and confident in herself too. It was SO REFRESHINGFull review to come (maybe.)
