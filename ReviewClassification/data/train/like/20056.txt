One of the most unique and engrossing novels I have ever read!The Warded Man tells the story of Arlen, Leesha, and Rojer and how their lives end up intersecting. We meet Arlen and Leesha when they are only eleven and Rojer when he is only four. They live in a world ravished by demons every night. Humans are forced to live behind protective wards or die terrible deaths at the hands of these demons.I have to admit it was hard to believe the book was over 900 pages long. The pages seemed to fly by as the story unfolded and drew me in. I could not help but become attached to the characters. The idea behind the novel is simple enough but how Peter V. Brett puts it all together is simple amazing. He weaves a story that becomes more and more complex as you read it, until finally, at least for me, it almost becomes real. I couldn't help but feel the fear the characters feel each evening as the sun begins to set and they find themselves rushing to get behind wards to protect themselves from the demons rising as mist from the ground. It is simply a terrifying image that cannot help but raise goosebumps.Be warned, once you start you will not be able to stop reading it!Definitely a 5 star read!For my review of the other books in this series, use the links below:Book Two:The Desert SpearBook Three:The Daylight War
