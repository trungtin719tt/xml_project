"Promise me, that you won't fall in love with me" says Jamie Sullivan to Landon Carter at the beginning of the novel. Nicholas Sparks might as well be telling me that because I picked this book based on my friend Patrick who has been insisting that this is the best Sparks. You see this is my 6th Sparks. I stopped after readingSafe Haven(2 stars) because I got tired of his Hallmark-kind of storytelling. So, I decided to give Sparks another try with a big doubt whether I would like this. This is the reason why it took me more than a month to finish this book. I started it and after few pages, I stopped.Promised that I would not like it. Too cheesy for my taste.Then started all over again then stopped again.Where was I? I forgot the story already.Then for the last 3 days,as I wanted to please my friend Patrick,I read without stopping and Ireally liked it.It's an easy read and the characters, though caricaturish, are sweet and lovable. I mean, the world is full of treachery and duplicitous people but here are Sparks' characters that are their total opposites. This book is totally an escapist work but I love it. It changes the panorama of how we view the world say from dusky and smuggy to sunny, clear with pink-tinted gloss. It's nice to escape to reality and this book is a nice way to do it.Reading Sparks is like eating at McDonald's. Of course I read more cerebral and serious books than this. Those are the healthy stuff or the steaks or those hard-to-pronounce French cuisine or those burned Meditterean veggies or those real raw treats in a Japanese resto. Despite having all those choices for good books, I still pick, once-in-a-while, a Sparks. We know what to expect and we can't deny that we like it. Just like going to McDonald's. We always see it our our way to work and we know that it is not healthy. But still pass by to have a quick fix for our hunger and we cannot deny that we like it.
