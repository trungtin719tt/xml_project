Amongst the few book I readafterseeing the movie (part 1) and I must say I liked having those extravagant pictures in my mind while enjoying the whole story.It was a very compelling ride! I loved book 1 &amp; 2 more than book 3, but not by much. It was the first series I'd read in ages and got me really hooked to books again - so for that alone I amverygrateful.The story was always gripping, didn't have slow parts and I was involved from start to beginning. I empathized with the characters easily. I'm realizing only now that my smartphone's notification sound is Rue's whistle - and I read the series 2 years ago!I don't specifically watch out for the Young Adult genre, being over 40 myself, so I decided on reading this after having liked the movie and didn't mind at all. It has happened to me since that I only realized a book to be YA afterwards. I find myself ignoring this categorization.
