Re-read 01.09.2017From 3 to 4 stars.The first book I read from Christie wasThe Big Four(1927), but starting from that was a huge mistake, because it's vastly different from the usual Poirots. Luckily,Death on the Nilewas next in line, and it confirmed once and for all that my time wouldn't be misspent reading Christie, just like it wasn't misspent watching the television adaptations for a long time before I moved on to her books.The plot ofDeath on the Nileis the only one I can remember vividly, in part because theAgatha Christie's Poirotadaptation is one of my favorites, so I've seen it several times. After nine years, the plot seems even more brilliant than the last time (not to mention that I really love how the novel is set in Egypt). It's the ultimate concept of presuming something is true just because it looks like it is, but we all know how one can't trust anything Christie shows us.When you know the murderer and the role of each passenger, it's also interesting to spot all the details where one can actually get an idea who the culprit is. As always, though, the details might not be hidden between the lines, but they're definitely obfuscated enough so that it becomes extremely hard to see the true meaning of certain scenes or words.Sidenote: I've recently decided to start collecting certain books from certain publishers (like Hodder's Stephen King paperbacks and classics in Everyman's Library editions), because I feel like my money is better spent on carefully selected books than impulse purchases, andDeath on the Nilehas the honor of being the first of HarperCollins's Agatha Christie facsimile editions on my shelf. Very pretty, I have to say, and I'll be posting about it onInstagramlater today.- - -10/09/2008I should have known I like Christie because her stories are just simply wonderful old-fashioned crime puzzles that make you turn the pages and sigh when everything's finished. There's not much action or focusing to the crime solver's personal life which is fantastic and in a lot of ways works better than the plots of formulaic contemporary crime novels. Also, the time in which the murders are set is part of the appeal to me. For a long time I've adored the tv movies because you could actually see the lovely costumes and the stories came to life. Now I'm really pleased to have finally decided to read the original books.You might also want to try one of my favourite games, theOrient Expressboard game if you want to train your "grey brain cells" like Poirot.
