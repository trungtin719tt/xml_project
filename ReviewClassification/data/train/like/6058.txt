I read this book before the movie was planned (at least to my knowledge), and I loved it from the beginning. It probably isn't the type of book you can read with lots of distraction around you, it requires a quiet setting where you can immerse yourself in the beautiful writing. Set in the beautiful Blue Ridge Mountains the story of the Civil War is told as it relates to the lives of those who live in this rural area, and the devastating effect it has on everyone. However, the story is much more about love, forgiveness and hope than just the despair of the seemingly endless days until Inman returns.
