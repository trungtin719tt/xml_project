On my quest for procrastination from readingthat book, I stumbled upon The Very Hungry Caterpillar onYouTube. In this video, Eric Carle himself is reading the story.This is not my first time with the caterpillar. I used to read it a lot when I worked with children. I like that it's short, that it helps them learn numbers and the days of the week. Now that I think of it, I did not have this for my son when he was small and learning to count. Shame on me.
