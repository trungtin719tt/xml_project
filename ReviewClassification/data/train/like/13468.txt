---Wow...just where do I start? Honestly, I was not sure whether I was going to read this book or not. I took the book home from the library 2 weeks ago, read a few gory pages and then stopped. I then read that this debut author, Andrew Davidson, was given a $2 million dollar advance on this book, and I had to read it to see what all the hype was about. I am so glad I did.The Gargoyle, is a story about redemption.This book is not for the faint of heart. The story begins with a horrible car accident which burns, disfigures and cripples the narrator, whose name we never learn. The accident was caused by an alcohol and drug induced hallucination. There is graphic depiction of what goes on in a burn unit (it is stomach churning to say the least). If you can make it through the first 40-50 pages, the best is yet to come.Before the accident, the narrator was a young, handsome porn star who spent his days seducing beautiful women, and getting high on drugs and alcohol. He did not feel anything and begins hating himself and those around him. It's only after he has lost everything that he begins to gain an understanding of beauty and compassion, and actually sees his life as better after being disfigured and starting over. While our narrator is recovering in the hospital, we are introduced to Marianne Engel (never just Marianne??). Marianne Engel is a woman with a mental disorder who is convinced she has been alive for the past 700 years and that she loved the narrator in another life. As she spins tales for him of love, he finds the possibility of redemption. The narrator must determine if his new found love is real or delusional.The redemptive nature and the well developed characters more than make up for the queasy stomach I briefly endured. RECOMMEND.
