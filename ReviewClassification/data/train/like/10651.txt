I'll use this one review for all the books of this series I've read (just to save time)and that's inclusive of 1-10. I truly enjoyed them, some a little more than others, but that's probably more of a reaction to my over indulgence than anything on the authors part (I was averaging three or four a week around school, yeah too much, kind of like a kid having too much candy and getting ill) These books are creative, action packed, display the gospel credibly and made me care about the characters. The plot is based on a specific end times view (I forget which one, to be honest when I was reading them I wasn't to interested I just wanted to keep up with what was going on in the story) It has a lot of characters and as the books progress it can get a bit confusing for some people to keep tabs on who, where, what and all that jazz. If you like ridiculously long series, Biblical perspectives and a fun cast of characters these are definitely for you! (just pace yourself, and don't repeat my mistake. Just because they are all in print doesn't mean they need to be read in the same month!)
