Update (August 2017): Oh y'all. I never updated this with my latest collection pictures. Well... ya girl managed to find ARCs of Graceling, Fire, Bitterblue, Jane, Unlimited (purple), Jane, Unlimited (white)... and UK Bitterblue.Aaaaaaaand I bought the lovely Italian version of Fire! Plus the Catalan version of Graceling. Gorgeous, right? Don't tell my wallet. D:********It has been YEARS since I read this book. I read it back in 2009 (or maybe early 2010?), before I was blogging, when I was a wee little teenager. I'm now a blogger/reviewer, and I've been trying to track down the ARCs for Cashore's books. I got Bitterblue's (it's the most recent, and many people still had their ARCs of Bitterblue), but Fire and Graceling ARCs are incredibly rare and difficult to find. BUT.BEHOLD.*crying*I just need to find Graceling's ARC! I say "just need to" like it's a simple task. SIGH.I read this book four years ago (ish), before I was reviewing/blogging. Still my all-time favorite book. If you asked me to recommend ONE book, or save ONE book from a fire, or keep ONE book of mine forever, it would be this one.:)
