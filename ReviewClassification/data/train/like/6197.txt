Warning: Extremely Long Review and Childhood StorytellingWhen I was ten or eleven, I was sitting in the playground at summer camp, minding my own business and reading this book, when one of the playground supervisers came and asked me what I was reading. When I showed it to him, his eyes got wide and he took the book from me. Then he went to the trash can and started ripping it up, page by page. And he washed his hands afterwards, "to get rid of the filth." It was alibrary book. He was just going on and on about how young children shouldn't read about witchcraft because they might want to become witches, etc. etc. If you've read the book, you know that Dahl doesn't exactly idealize witches. Well, when my dad came to pick me up, he let this guy have it (yay Dad!) and I got a popsicle. So the story ends well, but I always remember this incident when I see this book. And because of that, this book is what I think of when I consider censorship and how detrimental it is to our society. I barely remember what happens inThe Witches, but I love it simply because of what it represents to me.
