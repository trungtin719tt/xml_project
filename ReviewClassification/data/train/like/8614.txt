I finally saw how it all ended. After almost 20 years it feels amazing. I thought CS Lewis' interpretation of the end times was beautiful. The story was definitely more focused and serious in tone than many of the other books but I have to tell you that I loved it. Overall, I would probably give it a 4.75 stars! :)
