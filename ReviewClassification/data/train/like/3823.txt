CAN NOT WAIT FOR LAST SACRIFICE.....Loveeddd spirit bound sooooo much... i was gutted when it ended. the last chapter was an amazin clif hanger lol... i felt like it was kind of like an insight to the next book and kinda what it has to offer ... i definitly think abe will get her out of jail at the court because they wouldn't continuously mention the fact he is like a big bad ass and has all these connections ... hes like the moroi verson of the godfather... i think dimitri will finally snap out of his trance and realise that rose doesn't care about what he did and yeah he was evil but not by choice... and then they will finally possibly be together... (fingers crossed).. i also think that theres something fishy about Tasha Ozera throughout the books i kinda thought she was a pointless character but i think she could possibly come out in this book and could possibly be Rose's enemy... and maybe shes plotting against rose in some way.. why would she vote to have rose as her guardian knowing that shes Lisa's???... And i was thinkn... how did someone kill the queen and get away withi it when shes constantly guarded at all times by guardians??... were there no cameras at the court for the queens protection like there was with the prison??... how did they not get caught on the camera or how did they get in and out of rose's room withouth being caught on the camera??... Maybe its someone who knows the guardians and they dont see as a threat..Tasha Ozera by some chance?... I really have alot of questions i want answered and i cant believe i have to wait until december lol... DEfinitly hope the spin off series has suhin to do with adrian hes such a babe lol... but not for rose ... as shes in love with the beautiful dimitri... awww richelle mead you smart women.... I LOVE THESE BOOKS... twilight do not get a look in when it comes to these books... i think it would ve amazin if they made VA into a TV series.... **one can dream**
