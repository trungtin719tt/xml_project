This is an emotional,heartwarming story of three impaired individuals starting withDenise Holden, a single mother who is struggling to raise her four year old sonKYLE, a cute boy who suffers with delayed speech disorder(an auditory processing syndrome). AndTaylor Mc Aden(the flawed hero,dealing with his demons),the volunteer firefighter who rescued Denise and Kyle in a heavy rain storm,when their car crashed on the edge of a swamp.So far,I think this is thebest novelI've read ofNicholas Sparks,because this book revolved around a little boy who needed special attention which the author had brilliantly crafted.He formulated a well-planned mother and son relationship that deeply touched my heart.He also did a great job portraying a mother's determination and dedication to help her son and for that,I gave this book a 5 star rating.I should've deducted a star because I still didn't like the idea/style of the author taking away one important character in the story,but what can I do? But then,Sparks captured the essence of love,devotion and sacrifices in this book.Not to mention the fabulous secondary characters,particularlyMitch,Melissa,andJudy McAden. So I guess,these facts about this book is worth for the rating I gave.^^
