This is one of Sidney Sheldon's most exciting works; the story of the lovely female protagonist (as usual!), Tracy Whitney who bounces back against all conceivable odds to become a very successful...thief. Specialist in stealing expensive jewelry, largely. Her life is exciting earlier on, even though she only has an average job, and is about to get married to a respectable, comfortable man. But then disaster ensues as her mother is forced to commit suicide, and Tracy herself is ruthlessly framed and incarcerated. Life is of course hell for her in prison, but thanks to some fortuitous events, she is pardoned, and free again! But (polite) society is unwilling to accept her back, and she finds herself increasingly embracing a life of crime. She surprisingly surpasses herself in this path and carries out a series of brazen, incredible thefts around the world. Yet we warm to her always, and it hardly matters that she destroys some hapless people along the line. Like the director of a prized museum, Machada. "It was agreed that the prudent course of action would be to get rid of the painting as quietly and as quickly as possible. The dark-suited mine filed out of the room silently. No one spoke a word to Machada, who stood there sweltering in his misery..." We might as well bear in mind that the whole brilliant story here is a fantasy. Tracy's successes essentially hinge on the idiocy and fatuity of others including international police who believe she is a one-woman global gang of thieves...how she outwits the museum to garner a prized painting can never happen in real life, and what self-respecting crooks would entrust a multi-million diamond to a homing pigeon???
