The undiminished, unending nightmarish brutality of this novel might become an exercise in repetition and gratuity, were it not for undiminished horror contained in its subjects, taken both narrowly (the holocaust) and more broadly (the bottomless capacity of humans to inflict atrocities upon other humans). Early phantasmagoric and folkloric aspects and presentation as a series of episodic 'fables' creates an expectation of the hope/fear rhythms of a fairytale, but the first side of that equation, instead, is rigorously denied, along with any chance of reading pleasure. That said, it's an impressive novel, particularly in how the horror extends into the post-war peace -- for this child protagonist, there will be no return to pre-war wholeness or stability.I was reading some other reviews of this one, particularly Paul Bryant's where he outlines the book's failure to be credible despite its impressive force. I'm not sure how the book was received when it appeared (besides by Kosinki's accounts of being attacked for it by people who took it very very literally) but I don't even think realism is the intent here. This is inconceivably the true experience of any one character. Instead, Kosiniski seems to be drawing from the undeniable factual devastation and cruelty of the period to construct a horrific symbolic widescreen tableaux of people acting horribly towards eachother (this obviously extends well beyond the acts specifically directed at the protagonist throughout), in Poland or elsewhere. In this aim, it seems to capture something all too disquietingly real.
