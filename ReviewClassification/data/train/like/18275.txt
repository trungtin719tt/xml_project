I wonder how much this book influenced Thomas Harris'The Silence of the Lambs, what with the insect/butterfly collecting, kidnapping and keeping a woman in a dungeon plot, etc.Ferdinand is lonely, under educated, repressed, impotent, and psychotic. He also collects butterflies. He kidnaps Miranda, a beautiful art student (who he has been obsessed with for some time) in a carefully prepared dungeon. He doesn't want to rape or torture her - he wants to convince her to love him. An impossible (and very creepy) situation! She is obviously another of his "collection", a trapped and beautiful creature.The first part of the book is told from his point of view, and the second part is told from hers (thanks to the fact that she is keeping a secret diary), then it switches back to his point of view. I loved this technique - seeing the same timeline from the two characters. It added a depth and complexity to my experience. Both characters can be quite unlikable at times (surprisingly, Miranda annoyed me more with her pontificating about art). However, her diary entries became quite introspective(view spoiler)[ She actually grew as a human being to the point of feeling pity for her captor, and developed self awareness to the point where she admits that she would never regret the kidnapping happening (even if she never escapes) because she has become a better person because of it!(hide spoiler)]. The ending is... wow(view spoiler)[ I am SICK that he let her die! Talk about being impotent in every possible way. And his intention to continue his 'collection', what a chilling way to end the book, with the reader knowing with dread what lies ahead for the next girl.(hide spoiler)].Written in 1963, this book paved the way for many psychological thrillers in a similar vein. I'm interested in reading more by this author.
