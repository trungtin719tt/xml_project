I read this one in a rush thirty-some years ago so I'd have it finished before our book club met to discuss it, and now have revisited it via audio. I'm glad I did; I didn't appreciate nearly enough that first time around. It's a sequel to Ender's Game, but I'd say upon reflection that Ender's Game serves more as an introduction to this, the main feature. It continues from that story, but adds so much more in exploration of religion and responsibility in relationships and depth of culture that it seems a whole new universe is being introduced. Card deserves more recognition as a master of the genre than he's ever received.
