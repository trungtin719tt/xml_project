Binge reading? Me? Nah...&gt;_&gt;Ok, so to refresh the memory of recent events, I watched the final Hunger Games Saturday without a clue who the fuck any of those people are. I read Hunger Games #1 yesterday, and loved it. Now onto book 2.Loved it too, is it any surprise? It's awesome! I actually know more and more people from the movie now!So now that I've expressed my love for the book, allow me to rant.I HATE THE CASTING. Not all of it, of course, but Peeta, in particular. I'm sure Hutcherson is a fine actor. He's decent looking, that's not the point. The point ishe's not right for Peeta.I loved Peeta in the first book, my love for him continued in the second. He's just sogood. So pure, so nice. Self-sacrificial and genuinely well-meaning without being a martyr, and the on-screen portrayal of him ISN'T HOW I PICTURED HIM AT ALL. ARRRRRRGGGGGGGG!!!!!!!!!/endrantLet's talk about the love triangle. If you guys know me, you will know that I absolutelycan't stand love triangles.99.9% of the time, they're useless. They add nothing to the plot, and they're only a device used to portrayl how ULTRA FUCKING SPESHUL AND BEAUTIFUL AND PERFECT AND DESIRABLE THE MARY SUE MC IS.There's a love triangle in this book, and it was perfect.If a book has to have a love triangle, this is how it should be done. Gale is her long-time friend, almost a brother, for whom she naturally develops genuine feelings for. Their relationship is based on mutual respect; they take care of each other. They don't underestimate one another.Peeta is a tool. I don't say that in a bad way, likehe's such a tool, man. I mean that he is a tool for Katniss' survival. Their "love" for one another ensured their survival in the Games. Despite Peeta's long-time crush on Katniss, she doesn't return his feelings, and in fact, held him at arm's length, under deep suspicion until he proves himself.So yes, I approve of this motherfucking love triangle. And I more than approve of this book.
