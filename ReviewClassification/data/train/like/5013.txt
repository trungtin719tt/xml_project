Well call me surprised. Shocker of the century! I actually loved this book. I could not put it down. I was scared starting it due to what I thought would be inevitable romance but it was pretty minor in this one. But OH MAN did I wanna throw Adri to the wolves. What a terrible human. She got my blood boiling so friggin much. Also, cyborgs? Mind control? Moon people? Get outta here obviously I'm gonna like this book. All seriousness it is just well written. Cinder is a great character and you find yourself really associating with her plight, which kept me engaged. I can't really think of anything that bothered me about this book. But yea, wow.....never would have thought I would enjoy this as much as I did. 5 stars, A+, some other arbitrary ranking system maximum etc etc. Read it!
