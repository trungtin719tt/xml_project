I don't know what Ben Peller was smoking when he wrote this book, but whatever it was, pass it my way! This third volume in the "To Live" trilogy is both very trippy, and very relevant. Shawn Michals is back, but another awesome strong female character named Bina is introduced to help him on this final story of his journey. Unnamed islands, dueling political parties, fantasyLAnds where dreams and nightmares come true... this book has it all and then some. It all comes together, pieces of a puzzle that create a grand design. Bravo.
