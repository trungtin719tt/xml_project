This book is everything I LOVE LOVE LOVE about historical fiction. This was such an enjoyable read. Every time I put my book down, I was eager to get back to it. I am a huge fan of Jeffrey Archer. I have enjoyed everything I have read by him. I always know what I'm getting when I pick up one of his books. I have 2 more to read in the next month.This story of Kane and Abel had me hooked from the beginning. I loved the descriptions of the people. I could see them clearly. Some of the connections were predictable, but I didn't care. I also liked the ending. It was kind of sad for me, but I felt it was appropriate.
