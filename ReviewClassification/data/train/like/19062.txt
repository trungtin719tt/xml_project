HILARIOUS. An AWESOME story. Anyone who has a family, or wants to have a family, will love this book. Especially people with a lot of kids in their family (my mom) or very eccentric dads (me).This is the true story of a family of twelve children, whose father is a motion study expert and believes that what applies to workers in a factory also applies to children at home, and vice versa.Mykle and I are reading this together right now, and we cannot turn a page without him busting up laughing.The only thing I hate about this book is the cover on my copy, which is a picture from the movie "Cheaper by the Dozen" starring Steve Martin. I HATE this because the movie and the book are completely separate stories, and the image of one should NOT be used to endorse the other; the one and ONLY thing that the family in the movie has in common with the family in the book is that they have twelve children. That is IT. The rest of the movie is 100% Hollywood, and it SUCKS. I would gladly trade my like-new copy of this book for a run-down older version with yellowing pages.
