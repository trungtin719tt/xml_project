I am the kind of person who has never read 'MBs' . yes.. the. 'Mills &amp; Boons' mania. Infact by the age I realised what they are and how essential they were in the growing years of a girl's life, I never even felt like reading them. So you can imagine how I feel about love stories, the candy floss romance, boy meets girl &amp; they start dating &amp; before they knwo they fall in love and then the problems start. So here I have summarised 99% of the love stories written - sometimes the only difference is that problems happen before they fall in love other than that I find them all the same. Its not as if I don't believe in love but its just that I cant digest all the same sounding romantic dialogues &amp; so predictable outcomes or events. It just gives me creeps &amp; I feel that all this is so weird only meant for the teenagers who have just gained puberty and belive romanc eis what happens in Yash Chopra or Karan Johar movies.So when one of my very good friends asked me to read this book, I was so skeptical of wasting my time. But looking at the size of the book I felt I can atleast do this for a friend. The book was a smooth sale. Thankfully I had not watched any of the 100s of movies made on the book, but this being an aged book had been adapted over time in zillion of forms in movies or TV. I liked the book and enjoying reading it but it did feel like read or seen before, but I so cant blame teh book or the author for the same.The book is new as ever and even if i read it now, it would give me the same feelings as it did then. Unlike my friend or friends I did not cry at the end neither I felt sad or horrible. But it left a nice feeling of reading a book that shows love so fresh like a morning dew. Feelings so natural of two normal individuals and not just puppy love of heroes. That not all love stories have a happy end, but they have a happy journey. It felt like a love story of us, the way it happens and the way we understand it and feel it.So all those romantics in heart you cant miss this.And all the not so romantics you definitely cant because romance is an element in all our lives in whatever form and whatever age. You can judge it, leave it, avoid it but you cant ignore it.
