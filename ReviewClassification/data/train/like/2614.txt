I just re-read this book and got so much more out of it than the first time. The symbolism &amp; parallels to basic Christianity stuck out.*turkish delight is our human nature, prone to addiction, selfishness and wrongdoing*Peter said about Edmund, "We should go after him. After all he is our brother." Even though he had just betrayed them and was causing grief they didn't mistreat or disown him.*The very mention of Aslan's name caused certain positive feelings to come over them all they didn't know why. But it made Edmund feel guilty.*After Ed was returned and his siblings saw him for the first time Aslan said, "Here is your brother and there's no need to talk about what's in the past." They forgave their brother. Aslan neither excused him nor condemned him.*They all knew better than to go into a wardrobe &amp; shut the door as the book mentions a whole bunch of times. We regularly do things when we know better.*The professor makes them think and questions their disbelief in Lucy's story. This is something the movie totally leaves out. "Who would you usually believe, Lucy or Edmund?" etc. Edmund shows the worst side of human nature, to betray &amp; let others down.*I love that Father Christmas comes giving gifts that represent the gifts &amp; talents we each have to help others with and to overcome evil with.There's more but I have to go! Loved the book. And the movie.
