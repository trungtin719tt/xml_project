What a great and cute addition to the Harry Potter series! Fairy tales from the wizarding worlds which very much look like our fairy tales, but which are unique as well. I especially loved the tales about the hairy heart and the three brothers, and now I'm quite eager to watch the upcoming movie as well :) If you love fairy tales and if you love Harry Potter, I'm pretty sure you're going to love these tales as well!
