Re-read August 2015This is one of those stories that makes you stop and think "What if." It is very much Christian fiction that focuses on the Book of Revelation, starting the Rapture and tells of the story of those left behind. Although, even just for story value I think non-Christians can possibly enjoy this as well so long as they accept this does not follow their beliefs. It is an interesting story unto itself.The book is told primarily from two perspectives. Cameron "Buck" Williams-a famous journalist looking for the next big story (boy did he get it here) and and Rayford (Ray) Steele, pilot. They are on a plane flight when suddenly a large portion of the passengers are gone. But it is not just on the plane, it is around the world. Many just disappear! As the two look into things through various connections they realize that it is the Christians and all children who are gone.There is also a lot of intrigue going on with the United Nations as powers unknown make their move. From political secrets to war and religion. Secrets, murder, loss and love can all be found within this book.There is a large cast of characters that seems to grow as the book goes on, so at times it might seem a bit overwhelming. This is my second time reading this. I actually read the first few books in this series years ago and remember that by the 4th book I wanted a list to keep track of characters. Now I was much younger than so maybe my mind can follow better now, but just in case, I am taking notes on this thrill ride!
