This book was one of a dozen or so books that I added to my TBR when I first joined Goodreads in January of 2013. It's also one of my favorite movies, so it's a shame that I'm just now reading the book. The audiobook narrator did a fantastic job giving different voices to the characters. The movie played in my head the entire time, except for a few parts that weren't in the movie. I loved this book so much!
