This novel was absolutelyterrifying, especially because it somehow seemed soreal.While reading, I was constantly guessing how the whole thing was supposed to end, because I really couldn't come up with a possible and fitting solution. But of course,Stephen Kingknew what to do! He left so much room for an individual interpretation, which is why this is one of my favorite endings to a bookever.I talk about how much I love King's writing style in every single of my reviews of one of his books, so I won't go into it again. You just need to know that this book contains the exact type of writing I adore so much and makes me such a huge fan of his works.There aren't as many characters involved in the story as there are in many of his other books, but they all were well developed and independent, and they all left an imprint on me.I didn't know all too much about the plot beforehand, but I think this was perfect for the story to have the effect on me that it had in the end. I found it so hard-hitting and depressing. I already know that I will definitely reread this book at some point, but I will have to thoroughly mentally prepare myself before I do so.
