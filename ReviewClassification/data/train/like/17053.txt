Marvelous to see how the rules of detective fiction/noir are placed so meticulous and clear in this, the first Sherlock Holmes novel. Halfway the locale turns exotic--Holmes already knows who the culprit is--and, fittingly, the motive is but half the story! What a feeling of pervasive excitement the mid 19th century had with these cerebral, albeit universal, yarns of suspense.As slight-yet-surprising as James Bond's first foray, Ian Fleming's "Casino Royale."
