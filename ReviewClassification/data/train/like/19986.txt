Even Cowgirls Get the Blues offers a hitherto unexplored form of fantasy which is wild, unpredictable, hilarious and beautiful. It is no surprise that Tom Robbins once again seduces the reader with his ever-intentive ways of expressing life and emotion through words. It is a surprise, however, that this most obscure story about a hitchiker born with abnormally huge thumbs is so deeply compelling. Who could have dreamt up such an idea except for Tom Robbins?Even Cowgirls Get the Blues is simultaneously sensual, sexy, cutting and beautifully graphic. It is about crushing the boundaries surrounding art and genius. It's about celebrating beauty in rarity instead of forcing conformity. It is about being a specialist among specialists and remaining proud even if you're part of an endangered species. It's about magic versus mysticism. It's about religion versus truth. It's about life, plants and women! I'll end this review with one of the many snippets of wisdom that resonated with me in particular."There's nothing wrong with nature being dumb and ugly because it is simultaneously, paradoxically, brilliant and superb. But to worship the natural at the exclusion of the unnatural is to practice organic fascism, which is what many of my pilgrims practice, and in the best tradition of fascism, they are totally intollerant of those who don't share their beliefs.......To insist that a woman who paints berry juice on her lips is somehow superior to the woman who wears revlon lipstic is sophistry. It's smug, sophistical skunk shit."
