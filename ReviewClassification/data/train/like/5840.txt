*4.5 out of 5 stars*I am so glad I finally picked this novel up. "A Time to Kill" really delves into the racism that's immersed into Southern culture and shows how disgusting and heartbreaking it is.Growing up in the South myself, I have noticed that things like racism, homophobia, and misogyny are deeply embedded into our culture. People use their religious beliefs to justify being absolutely disgusting to others (i.e. using gay slurs simply because your religion states that homosexuality is a sin.) "A Time to Kill" really showed dark, gritty racism in a very real way.The only real reason I gave this 4.5 stars instead of 5 is because it was a pretty slow read at times... but that's to be expected, as it's 1. Grisham's first novel, and 2. it's a book about a long court case.
