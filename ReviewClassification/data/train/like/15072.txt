It's amazing to us that this book is forty years old. It's as powerful and relevant now as it was in 1976, perhaps even more so.White is something just like black is something. Everybody born on this earth is something and nobody, no matter what color, is better than anybody else.From their love of the land to their love of one another and their fellow man, the Logans are a family that you need to spend time with. Highly recommended, even if (especially if) you've read it before.
