A terrific fast paced read. I think Longfellow meant it to be a racy throwaway, but accomplished instead actual literature anyone can read and love. How could you not love an affair between the head of a Chinese tong and a rich spoiled harebrained white girl? Or the coming-of-age of a great newspaper reporter who saw it all? Or the whole San Francisco earthquake described in page after thrilling page? And so much more.
