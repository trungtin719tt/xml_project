I have a real interest in reading true stories, the more interesting and unique the better. So I was drawn to the story of Lieutenant Howard Snyder during his time on the Susan Ruth which was essentially a flying fortress that was shot down in 1944. Through his own personal tale of survival during the Second World War, you learn so much about how the conflict affected not just one man, but also families, soldiers in other armies, and the atrocities that took place that so many found so hard to forget. 'Shot Down' is the true story of a remarkable man written by his son Steve Snyder, constructed from letters and journals of those her were there.I urge everyone to read this book, or others like it as it is so important to remember what so many people went through to ensure that we live in a free world today. We should never let the memories of those who served in World War II to fade, and books like this will help prevent that.
