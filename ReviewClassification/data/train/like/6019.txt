My Grandpa Cannon loved this story, and he often told of a time when he went to see a "picture show" about the Hound of the Baskervilles. "It scared the willies out of me," he said, and then he and his friend had to part ways as my grandpa rode his bicycle home in the dark.He was thinking about this devil-hound, and then he heard something panting behind him. He pedaled faster and faster, but the panting only got faster and faster too. Then, it was harder and harder to pedal, and his bike was going slower and slower. Just when he thought for sure he was doomed to die and the hound would get him, his bike stopped, the panting stopped, and he found that his back wheel had a flat tire. A flap of rubber had made the panting sound as the air was being released.That has nothing to do with this story, except that it is the reason I read the book. Good book too! Almost as good a story as my grandpa's.
