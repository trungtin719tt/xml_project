This book is not easy to read if your idea of reading is that it has a linear plot, characters that are either good, bad or somewhere in between, spirit-uplifting narratives and dialogues and inspiring theme.This book has none of those. Yet, this is one of the best-written books that I've ever read. Reading this was just a different experience: you don't know where Burroughs would take you every time you lift the page, you don't know who would appear as the characters and what they would say or do, you don't know how he could write with brilliant originality and fluidity. It is like being taken for a ride but you know that the ride would be simply a memorable one because you gasp as you go through each line of this book.Yes, it is about drugs (marijuana, heroin, morphine), sex, crime, pedophilia, sadism and all the monstrosities that you can think of as a normal human being. But think Vladimir Nabokov'sLolita(5 stars), Hubert Selby, Jr.'sLast Exit To Brooklyn(4 stars), Anthony Burgess'A Clockwork Orange(4 stars), J.G. Ballard'sCrashor even Maquis de Sade's monumentalThe 120 Days of Sodom. Their subjects are all monstrous but the writings are unparalleled and unequaled. This is postmodern and thus hard to understand. The trick is for you to just read and let the wordswash over youand somewhere in the middle of your reading you will start to get the drift until you find yourself marching with the grove and then you will find it unputdownable.The plot is fragmented that makes it not really a plot but a collection of short stories or even hallucinations (there is no story, like your "typical" story). It has some characters that appear in more than one instance like the AgentWilliam Lee, the pirateAJor the doctorBenjay.But their characters are notdevelopedjust like in most novels. You just have to take them as they are. There is also some kind of political undertones in some of the stories that reminded me of George Orwell's1984(4 stars) but it feels like just a side dish and not the main course. Being an artist belonging to the Beat generation, this book also reminded me of Hunter S. Thompson'sFear and Loathing in Las Vegas.This book also surprised me a bit: it is rare that I like a book with zero relatability to me. I mean, I had no experience whatsoever with any prohibited drugs and still I found this book amazing. It used to be that I would only like books that speak to me. Maybe my literary taste is maturing since I am in my fourth year of voracious reading. Thank you, Goodreads.My second Burroughs and he is still to disappoint. In fact, he, for me, is one of the best American novelists. Simply amazing work here.
