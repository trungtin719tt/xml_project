I first read this in Grade 11 and decided it was my favourite book. I knew a reread needed to happen right away, but it took me four years to finally get around to it when my boyfriend gifted me this beautiful illustrated edition. Animal Farm is a book I often think about and often quote, and it was a bit nerve-wracking to go back to it to see if it actually lived up to everything I had built it up to be. Thankfully, I'm thrilled to say it did.In many ways it's a little bit underwhelming the second time around, because the plot (which lots of people will already know because it's a retelling of the Russian revolution) is extremely simplistic. This meant, however, that I was able to focus more on motivations and symbols and the other meaty stuff outside of the plot (which, don't get me wrong, was still hella exciting).The big question: is this still my favourite book? Yes. I've not yet read a book that so succinctly and simply drives home an idea with wonderful intricacies and nuances. After all this time I also feel so comfortable with this book, I get it and love talking about it and see reflections of it all the time. Also, in response to this edition, I loved the illustrations. They were sinister and childlike and felt like political caricatures - I think Orwell would like them. Apparently Andy Serkis is going to be making a film adaptation of Animal Farm and I'm super jazzed. That doesn't really have anything to do with this review, but I wanted to share my joy.Finally, thank you to Greg for gifting me this pretty book, reading it aloud with me over FaceTime, and letting me go on big rants about why Benjamin is the WORST. &lt;3June 23rd, 2012:One of my favourite classics. Absolutely brilliant. Just great. Read it in Grade 11 and never looked back! Really introduced me into loving classics.
