This was a fun, refreshingly charming, quick read. That is, until it reached in, ripped my heart out and crushed it into smush. I adored the book, I adored the characters and their flaws, I adored the relationship between Oliver and Jenny.Highly recommended, please go read it if you haven't already. Now, if you'll excuse me, I need to go cry into a pillow.
