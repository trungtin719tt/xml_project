Fun, fun, fun- that is what these books are! Although this series is very apparently written for a teen audience (it even has the token homosexual couple), it was well written and so entertaining. Great for a fun, easy read. I love fantasy world the author has created of shadowhunters, demons, werewolves and vampires. I loved the plot twists and bit of romance. The last book (City of glass), was so exciting and was like a constant stream of climaxes for different aspects of the story- - it was truly hard to put down. It's one of those "guilty" pleasure kind of books (Twilight is like that for me). Read this for a great escape from reality!
