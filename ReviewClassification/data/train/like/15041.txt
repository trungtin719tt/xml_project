This is a hilarious, fast-paced book about a world where many state governments are ruled by magicians. Great Britain, for example, is governed by an elite group of magicians--many of whom are greedy, ambitious, and uncaring for other people. Magicians themselves have limited powers; most of their strength stems from their ability to summon powerful demons who are obligated to do their bidding.At the age of six, Nathaniel is apprenticed to a mediocre, hypocritical, incompetent self-consumed magician, Arthur Underwood. Nathaniel is bright, ambitious, and rather impetuous and impatient. Behind his master's back, Nathaniel summons a rather powerful djinni named Bartimaeus, in order to seek revenge on a powerful magician. Bartimaeus has lived for millennia, and is well experienced in dealing with magicians and other demons. His witty, sardonic commentary on the tasks he is ordered to perform add a wonderfully humorous tone to the entire book. This is counterbalanced by Nathaniel's naiive, self-righteous beliefs.I listened to this book as an audiobook. Simon Jones does an amazing reading, breathing a unique life to each character. When Jones reads Underwood's proclamations, the character's pomposity and determination to ignore his apprentice come ringing true. Don't read this book--listen to it!
