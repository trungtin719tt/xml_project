He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,And away they all flew like the down of a thistle.But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,HAPPY CHRISTMAS TO ALL, AND TO ALL A GOOD-NIGHT!I've read this book for the first time and that too "the Night before Christmas" ( coincidence! ), followed by listening to its audiobook, for the second time! &amp; my, oh, my! The illustrations, the rhymes, and fancy Christmas vibes made me feel warm and mushy!I think I'm going to read this every year as my Christmas tradition and will read it to my future kids as well, probably dragooning them to memorize it! :P
