"Mom. Mom. Mo-om. Mom. MOM!"My mom whips around. "WHAT??!""CanIgetabook?""What?""Can... I... get... a... book...?""How much is it?""$8.50.""What is it?"I brandish a copy ofWhere The Wild Things Arefrom behind my back."Don't you already have that?""Nuh-uh.""Aren't you a little...oldfor a book like that?"I pout. "But Mo-om...""Okay," she sighs. "Put it in the cart."--ten minutes later--My mom leaves the car to go put the cart back.I look around suspiciously, making sure the coast is clear.I lean over the back seat and start digging through the bags.Finding the book, I crawl back into the front seat with it.My mom returns."Couldn't you wait until we got home?""Nope." I'm turning the first pages, reading everything slowly.My mom starts the car. "Sometimes I can't tell if I have a twenty-four- or a four-year-old daughter."I'm still immersed in the book. "At least I no longer pull up my skirt in the grocery aisle and show everyone my Barbie underwear.""I certainly hope not!"I grin mischievously.
