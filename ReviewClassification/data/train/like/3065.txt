Sweet, funny, sad... what do you expect in a story about a boy and his beloved hounds? I mean, sure, I could do without the hunting, but appreciating it for the time and place in which it's set, it's a lovely story about growing up, loyalty, and adventure. Read as part of my attempt to experience some of the Great American Read books that I missed in my youth!
