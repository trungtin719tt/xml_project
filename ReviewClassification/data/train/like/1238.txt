This is an extraordinary book set in Afghanistan. The author draws inspiration for this fictional book from his real life experiences. The result is a fantastic story. The story itself reveals a lot about a culture that many people consider obscure, foreign certainly, otherworldly maybe.The snippets of imagery, the nuggets of wisdom are so visceral, that I had to pause for a while. I had to gather my thoughts before continuing. Marshall my reader's resources, so to speak. Afghanistan has been the battleground for supremacy between Cold War USA and USSR.The last third of the book is very slick. But the one character that chewed up the scenery is the main villain. His involvement in Hassan's and Amir's lives was very interesting. I loved the fact that the story was set in the 70's. All in all it was a thoroughly good experience reading this book. However though I loved reading it, it has no repeat value for me, because I feel too sad with such books. I'll never re read it. Once is enough.
