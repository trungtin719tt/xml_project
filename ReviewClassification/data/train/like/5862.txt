This is my second Gaiman book, and it's my favorite so far! First, I must say Stardust is one of my favorite movies ever, so I wasn't sure about reading the book! But alas, the time came! There were some different aspects to the book than the movie, and I really liked seeing the differences. I still like the movie better, but Gaiman's writing is so extraordinary. It sucks me in and doesn't let go! Tristran was a bit of an idiot, but he was also one in the movie, too! But I really loved Yvaine, she is a star, and she really shines in the book! Lol, I like what I did with that last line! Full review on my bloghttps://literarydust.wordpress.com/20...
