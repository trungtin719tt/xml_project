I am so sorry. I just couldn't resist!-Did I just havereallybad taste in books growing up?Was that it? Because the more I read MG novels, especially the fantasy ones, the more I feel the urge to kick myself in the shin for not reading them sooner. But hey, you know what they say.You're never too old to have a happy childhood.There isa lotthat I love about this novel. I love the characters, I love the writing, I love the world that they live in, and I especially love the last line. (No spoilers, but the very last sentence of this novel had me crying from laughter.) I even kinda love Seth, even if some of his actions had me going like this:Seth, you frustrate me beyond disbelief. But I probably would've done the same things you did, so I can't blame you.Sometimes, I forget just how enchanting a simple fantasy can be. I read so many adult fantasies with such complex worldbuilding and they're great, but an MG fantasy every now and then reminds me that there is beauty in simplicity. When I think about what happened in this book, all I can really say is that it's about two kids who visit their grandfather only to find out he lives in a magical reservation, but...I dunno. It feels bigger than that.Or maybe it isn't, and its charm is in its smallness. Whatever the case, I hadplentyof fun.Of course, this is a series, so I'm sure that that simplicity won't last and that this world is just going to get more complex as we go along, but I'm still up for the ride! I can't wait to get my hands on all five books of this series. Does it get better and better?
