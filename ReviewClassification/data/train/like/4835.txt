It took me AGES (4 1/2 fucking months smh) to read this and I have absolutely no idea why. I enjoyed it a lot.I thought I would like it even more than I did though.I had a few problems with King's writing style in this particular book (especially in the beginning) even though I'm normally a really big fan of it.And I was bored to death every time there were actual parts of "Misery" (the book that's being written by the author in this) to read. I don't know why, I just didn't care for them.Other than that, this was pretty awesome.Annie was such a well written, interesting and absolutely terrifying character!She helped a lot with building the right atmosphere.I'm so excited for watching the movie!
