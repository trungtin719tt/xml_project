Reread #2This is still my favorite book. It's whimsical, beautiful, heart-warming, heart-wrenching, dark... it's wonderful. I love it so much.---------------------------------------Upon Reread:It's even better the second time. I will never stop rereading this book. It's so important to me and I don't even know why. Walt Disney, I've always loved you, but I'm never touching merch that reflects your version of this story. Nothing can compare.----------------------------------------This is one of my new favorite books. it's hillarious, it's heart tugging, it's one that I'll go back to many many times. I'm so happy I read the original story.
