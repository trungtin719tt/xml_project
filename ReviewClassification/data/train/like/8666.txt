[Second Read]Still 4.25 stars!This series is so amazing - I'm glad I picked it up again!**********************[Original Review]4.25Ah, this book.I read this book/series about 3 years ago, and whenever I think about it I still remember how amazing it was. I know some people say that Meghan is annoying and not likeable, but I never thought so. She's insecure, like many of us are and I always thought that made her very relatable. She felt real - and I felt as though I was going through everything alongside her.Now, I will agree that this book is the "worst" of the whole series, but it only gets better. I mean, Ash and Puck are amazing characters that you will fall in love with, undoubtedly.Gosh! I adored this series. I might even re-read it again because I loved the character development, the writing style....everything, honestly. It was just a really good read. Fans of The Immortals Rule by Julie Kagawa will love this series as well.Overall, a book for anyone who's craving an imaginative story that will paint a picture in their head, filled with beautiful broken characters and a magical realm.
