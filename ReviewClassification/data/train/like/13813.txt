this series of books caught my interest when i read a review by another goodreads member who seemed to have tastes similar to my own. so i was a little surprised when i realized it was young adult fiction but seeing as i am always looking for what may be the next great dystopian work i decided to give it a go.for the record i started out with the first in the series, uglies, but a week or so later i had torn thru the first three which seem to be the trilogy. there is another in the series but the characters don't seem to be the same so westerfeld perhaps decided milk the world he came up with for another round, glad he did, i'll read it soon.seeing as this is saposed to be a review i must say first that these books really got my attention and held it. the story progresses in a simple linear fashion but some twist and turns to keep it interesting. the setting is well described and seems almost believable even though it's got a little sci-fi jetsons feel to it. It reminded me of cory doctrow's work, with a little of john christoper's 'the tripods' mixed in (although it was a long time ago when i read that)basic premise is a girl about to turn 16 lives in a futurisic, post apocoliptic, every one is happy but clueless, totalitarian city. she ends up mixed up with another girl her age who is able to give her a glimpse outside the matrix. this basicly leads to some unexpexted consequences. the series follows our main character thrue several very dramatic transformations that by the end left me wanting more, like a good book should.like i said these books were written for a younger audience but i think they still paint an interesting setting and are just fun to read. if your looking for a quick easy read, a book you want to share with a younger person that you will also find interesting, or just ran out of alternate future world books to read, then try it out, i think you'll like it.
