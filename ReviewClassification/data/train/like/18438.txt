This is a reread for me but the last time I read it was probably 1998 or thereabouts. It was such a delight to read it again. WhenJ.D. Robbwrote this first book in what was then going to be just a trilogy I wonder if she had any idea of what she had created. 40 or so books later we all feel we own a little bit of Eve and Roarke and their amazing world and we are always waiting for more!I loveNaked in Death. It introduces us to our two most important characters, begins their delightful relationship and sets the scene in a fascinating futuristic world. Some of the side characters also appear in this first book and we begin to discover the awful past which is Eve's driving force. I know the story well but still reached for the tissues when Eve disclosed some of her history to Roarke. Must not forget the fact that this is a crime novel and as well as romance there is a great story line and a mystery to be solved. I loved every minute of it the first time round and I loved it again this time.
