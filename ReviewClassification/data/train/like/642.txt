This great book (drama of course) I read in a single night. Naturally, an English graduate seldom can remain away from Shakespeare and his realm. However, even as an individual, before I began my studies seriously, Shakespeare and some of his creations were on the list 'to be read'. Romeo and Juliet is a play, to be clear at the beginning. Yes, as critics (modern ones) claim, this is perhaps the most 'unlikely' play which does not synchronise with the reality as others by the same dramatist. Nevertheless, let's give the 'play' its due - it surely does create that sensation which Shakespeare wanted to. The ephemeral romance between the 'first sight lovers' and the enemies sworn to suck the blood out of their lives... everything went on perfectly to (at least) create the star of today's Hollywood - Leo!The book has its merits as well as the demerits. Shakespeare is the vacuum. You can keep your experiments going on... I would like to rather appreciate him for his creation this time. I enjoyed reading the play and truly did!
