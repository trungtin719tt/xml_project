Holy cow! I am done! Not sure what to say . . . I feel like I should write a 1000 page review, but I will keep it short.I finished the book while a passenger in a mini-van stuck in horrible Atlanta traffic.The book was not quite as readable as some other BIG books I have read, but still pretty good. What amazed me is how few specific events occurred during the 1000+ pages - Tolstoy was just really detailed in describing the events. Only a few times, though, did I feel like it was too much.This book may not be for everyone, but it sure feels cool to be able to say "War and Peace? Yeah, I read that!"
