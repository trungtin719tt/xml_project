If there's one thing I learned from this book it's this: Fuck cats. Big or small, cats are the source of all evil. Hell, even Billy's family left their cat behind when they moved. Yeah, man, cats suck.Now that I've made plenty of enemies, I will try and express my true feelings about this book.I laughed. I cried. I did a number of cliched things while reading Where the Red Fern Grows. Mostly, I had fun. I dug running around with Billy and Little Ann and Old Dan, and I hate that I was one of the only kids in America who didn't get to read this book while being institutionalized... er, I mean, while I was going to school.I especially liked that the meaning behind the title isn't given away until three pages from the end.In summation: This review is pure shit, but this book is amazing. Read it, and may your hatred for all things feline burn a hole in your heart.
