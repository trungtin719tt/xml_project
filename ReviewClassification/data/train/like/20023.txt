One terrific novel. Great to know: the page-turning literary novel is alive &amp; well in the 2010's!The intersecting stories are all pearls of a deep maudlin color mauve. Blue, frozen stories which, because of their humanity, resound like the echoes in mountains. (An interesting motif regarding the immobility of singular fates, &amp;/or the full circle reconciliation with the past.)Wholeheartedly recommended to me by my pal Segen, &amp; I in turn also wanna do the same.
