9.5/10 stars. This book was really good. I loved it and I finished it in 2 sittings. I feel like this book was more factual than fiction because of the accurate descriptions of how Bree/Kristen went through "the monster" aka meth. It scared me a little bit on what meth does to you. Overall, this book was really nice and the ending was a little shock. I still love Impulse more in there, it was so real about deaths and everything, it scared me. This was also very real but in my heart, it tugs more to Impulse than Crank but I still am going to continue the trilogy. Better review soon.Footnote: Ellen Hopkins in officially my favorite author.
