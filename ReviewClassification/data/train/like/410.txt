The inherent evil in Teletubbies. The satanic perversion of one very Disneyfied utopia. Orwell's super scary fairy tale is PERFECT. The tenderness in the animals easily translates to that shared by all mankind for itself. And, oh, so easily do modern political players fill the spots of pigs or dogs.Basically in "A.F." all the little animals contracted serious rabies simultaneously. Who will survive the plague? A.F.=America. The fairy story of SHORT MEMORIES &amp; DUPES.This is the first time I read this baffling novel. AF! Its NEVER too late to acquaint oneself with this authentic gem.
