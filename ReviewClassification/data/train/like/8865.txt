There are other editions of Dickinson's poems, but it is hard to trust their hyphenation at the least. In other cases, the poems have been more severely edited, and in my experience, that is almost always a watering down of theme and an inability to appreciate Dickinson's artistry.This is the only edition I recommend for the time being, and I am very grateful for it; it has been a privilege to write on poems such as"I dwell in possibility"and"There's a certain slant of light."Dickinson's thought is complicated and cryptic, because she did dwell in possibility, struggling with the nature of a certain light.
