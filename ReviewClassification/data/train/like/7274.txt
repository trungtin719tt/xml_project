The only reason this book doesn't get five stars from me is because I'm so confused by some things. But I liked it A LOT. A lot a lot.First, I didn't feel like it really went anywhere. It's like you can tell it'stryingto go somewhere but it's not really doing it.Basically, this book was just full of the flock running, getting caught, running, getting beat up, running, getting chased by the cops, running... Over and over. After a while it was kind of predictable (not to mention painful). It took me a while to realize the focal point of the book: finding out who their parents are. Once I finally got THAT, it was a little easier.James Patterson proves to be an expert with making great characters. Max has a sarcastic sense of humor that I love. This book was definitely entertaining, and I love the characters...LOVE them.That being said, Angel is a little annoying. I'm kind of mean, but if I see a little kid in Wal-Mart whining and demanding a toy it just grates on my nerves like nothing else. I try to cut her a break, since she's a six year old...but it's still aggravating. And the mind control thing is just creepy.But I LOVED this book. I'm definitely reading the next one. I just can't quite let myself add it to my "favorites" shelf.
