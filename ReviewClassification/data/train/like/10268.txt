I really enjoyed the wrap up of this "phase" of The Mortal Instruments. I had heard varied opinions on the ending, how some people felt the pay off didn't hold a candle to the amount of detailing and set up required to get there, but I thoroughly enjoyed it, probably because I was expecting(view spoiler)[a long, drawn out battle(hide spoiler)]but instead we get(view spoiler)[a satisfying dressing down of Valentine. I mean seriously, when Raziel is telling him off like a spoiled brat who needs to be put in his place made my heart soar.(hide spoiler)]Picking these books up a decade after they were originally published means I wasn't able to avoid all spoilers completely, but I gotta say I was still shocked by a few of the twists and amazed that I didn't see them coming. It's also nice to see how The Infernal Devices will tie in, because for the first two books I kept wondering "who are these random families and why should I care about them?" Also, Magnus + Alec = &lt;3 My absolute favs for sure.These books aren't for everyone, and I respect that, but I also see why they have such a large fan base. Cassie Clare can manage to fit multiple types of writing into a single storyline without it feeling jumbled or confusing. We have serious moments, romantic moments, but we also have moments where these teens are able to beteens. It's so important for authors to remind us that these characters in YA fiction aren't in fact middle aged men and women. Just the simple, ordinary moments, like the banter about their regular clothes and how to get girls or guys to like them is essential. On to the nest one soon!
