In memory, everything seems to happen to music.I must have seen an adaptation of this, somewhere back behind the fog and pines of my past. There was a vague familiarity around this family, sufficiently lit--I gather--to perceive some similitude. It is the screen onstage which makes this work, which rescues another play about a fallen family. Flashing reminders of machination. This imposition is a weighty hand from God indicating the fork in the road. While I could certainly appreciate the plight of the mother and daughter, it was the haunting figure of Tom, lost in drink and celluloid, which stirred my interest. Crushed in his responsibility as breadwinner, this Shakespeare of the men's room, longs for escape. I did feel the impulses of the play were truncated, strangely edited so the daughter and Jim could cut to the quick in an almost rushed manner. The drama suffers from that.
