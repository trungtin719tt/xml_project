I started reading this trilogy almost two years ago with my girlfriend, and despite taking some very long stretches off, we finally finished it today (her review in brief: the end drags a bit).These books were very important to me as a child, second only to maybe Harry Potter in terms of shaping my worldview. To be honest, I didn't understand the books, or the impact they had on me, until we started re-reading them last year. It's a re-read that got much richer with time, delighting and surprising me at every turn. I may have only really appreciated the polar bear fights, the sense of adventure (Lee Scoresby FTW) and the idea of daemons when I was a kid, but I truly grew to love the guiding ideas of the series, and the way its wonderfully human message filters through all of that stuff, at this point in my life. The end of THE AMBER SPYGLASS could never have meant as much to me as it did reading it to my girlfriend.This edition is absolutely beautiful, with some "lantern slides" added in between the books which function almost like deleted scenes. The final one, with an 18-year old Lyra, devastated me.I can't wait to read THE BOOK OF DUST now, and to re-read these again once I get the courage to tackle PARADISE LOST.
