I was pretty iffy about this book going in--I've read all of Stephenie Meyer's other books (the Twilight series) and they're decently good, but nothing amazing. I'm not big on sappy romances, and I was concerned that this would just be one big huge romance like the others.I was surprised, definitely. While it does have romantic elements to the story, it didn't feel like the romance took over the plot and didn't allow for any real story to happen.What I liked the best about this book is how much thought it seems Stephenie Meyer actually put into it. I really liked her mythos for the souls (the aliens who have invaded and taken over humans as their hosts), and the interesting planets she concocted. Something about it just seemed like she actually put forth some real world-building to come up with a very very fascinating race of invading aliens, I loved it.It was also really nice for me that the story was actually from the perspective of one of those very interesting aliens, rather than a human protagonist. I liked seeing the human race through the eyes of a gentle, non-warlike creature like Wanderer. And, despite it being told from an alien's perspective, it really was a story about human nature and what it means to be human. Definitely a lot more meaningful than her Twilight books.I went in being confused that it was an adult novel, because at the beginning it easily could have been a young adult novel like her others. The further I read, the more the classification made sense. The book delves into some pretty heavy thoughts about morality, and there are some very violent scenes (specifically men beating on a helpless woman) that are pretty rough.As someone who wasn't all that impressed by her Twilight books, I'm happy to say I really enjoyed this and had a really hard time putting it down at times. It's not without faults, but Meyer has definitely grown as an author and I hope we'll see more meaningful books like this from her!
