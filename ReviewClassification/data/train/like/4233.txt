I found myself smiling as I finished this reading of The Wind in the Willows. Yes I enjoyed the tale of Rat and Mole and Badger and Toad and all the other assorted animals and their people who populate that corner of England.What struck me most during this reading, which is my second as far as I recall, is that this just doesn't feel like a children's book in so many ways. The language is so rich. The descriptions, whether of characters or places, are so full. I find this better in some ways as an adult's children's story with all the obvious parables and lessons. Would they be obvious to a child? I wonder. Well this adult enjoyed them, given in their animal guise. Love and value your friends. Avoid that pride which definitely will lead to a fall. Biblical. Is this in fact the garden of Eden.
