I really enjoyed this reread. I love the characters (not so much the love interest, I mean, I liked him throughout much of this book but there are little things he does that have made me reexamine his character)I love Zara, I like her grandma, I love Issie &amp; Devyn. I loved the different types of beings in this book (ie, Pixies, WereTigers, WereWolves, Werebirds, etc.)I just really liked this book. Can't wait to reread Captivate next.
