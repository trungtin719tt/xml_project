Nothing is worse in prison than the consciousness of one's innocence; it prevents acclimatization and undermines one's morale...Comrade Rubashov has been arrested. But this is nothing. He's been around this block before. He knows, for instance, this truth about the consciousness of innocence - as the unseen man in the neighboring cell clearly does not. The unseen man who taps at the pipe...who is in many ways not unlike the conscience Comrade Rubashov put into storage some forty years before; the internal saboteur he's energetically barred from congress with the rest of his psyche; the empathetic weakness that tap-tap-taps so foolishly against the hardened steel of his intellect's door. It's a tap-tap-tap one indulges, but fails to politically profit by.Koestler's classic,Darkness at Noon, follows the aging Rubashov through the days and nights of this imprisonment. His time on the political stage is coming to a close. His peers within the regime, once lions of Communist might, have been picked off by the younger cubs of the Revolutionary State. Philosophical Neanderthals, he calls them, and yet they are the future. And in the weeks that follow we will watch him come to terms with this reality in the same manner, it has long been suspected, Arthur Koestler was forced to come to terms with his own socialist past. It is a stark and unforgiving light he shines on Communist Party politics. When coupled with the blinding pain of a man whose incarceration shifts, splits and mutates through the physical, the intellectual, the emotional...well, let's just say I thought the comparisons to Kafka and Dostoevsky were both accurate and deserved.
