I have read this to my daughter since she was two months old. She is now 20 months old going on 21 months and I have to say that I grown to appreciate this book. This is not only due to the enjoyment she gets or because the little rabbit procrastinates going to bed like my little one does. No, like all great children's literature, this book has a couple of layers. I enjoy this book because I think it's about a child's version of death. I'm not crazy - promise! Maybe it's the perplexing Old Lady whispering hush or maybe it's the "Goodnight Nobody" page but I think there is something else going on here with this book. Or maybe it's because I've read it so often I need to think on a different level as I read this.
