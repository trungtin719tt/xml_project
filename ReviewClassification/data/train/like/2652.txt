I sat down to "read a few pages" of this before bed two nights ago and had to force myself to stop at page 100...then picked it up and flew through the rest the next day.I really enjoyed this one (as did millions of others, obviously) and, with this installment, I am definitely seeing why this is such a beloved series. The magical wizarding world of Harry, his friends, and the folks at Hogwart's is just FUN to read about.I am in LOVE with Fawkes the phoenix and I adore Dumbledore...And now I am so worried something bad is going to happen to one of them over the course of the remaining books.And, yes, I know it's probably made you gasp in shock that - in addition to never having read the books before now - I have also never seen any of the movies...and I truly have no idea what happens throughout the remainder of the series.I guess it IS possible to blissfully ignore spoilers for over two decades...unless we are talking aboutGame of Thrones. Good luck making it a fucking day with all the assholes posting every single scene on Twitter.Not that I'm on Twitter...But I digress.So yeah, firstly, loved this book and looking forward to the next one.And secondly, now more of the art on the HP mug I got from OwlCrate a few months ago makes more sense and I totally love it more now, so there's that.Winning all around.
