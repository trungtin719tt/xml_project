This book was sitting on my shelf for more than over a year, and I had no plans to rush and read it. I mistakenly thought it is just another novel about 'love', so I withheld reading it.I was wrong.But I guess back then it was not the right time for me to read it.A while ago, I became obsessed with Rumi's poetry, and so, one of my friends recommended that I should read this novel ASAP.So I did.What can I say? I'm still quite shaken by this masterpiece.The novel consists of two parallel narratives; a one by which tells the story of a woman named Ella.Ella had to learn to live her life while shutting her heart to love, that is until a book titled 'Sweet Blasphemy' fell under her hands, and ended up to shake her entire world and change everything she had known.The second narrative, tells the story of a wandering dervish called Shams of Tabriz who was on the lookout for a companion that he can deliver his knowledge to, and it was none other than Rumi.I loved this novel so much, mostly because of Shams and his rules. These rules are ones to go by for life.I highly recommend it. I will definitely mesmerize you.
