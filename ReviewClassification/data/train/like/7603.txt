The immediacy of death is the most striking feature ofThe Plague. Camus strips away the abstractions and sentimentality that we might have in viewing death. Some may die peacefully. Other may die with a vengeance, fighting even at their last moments.As the plague in the story begins to claim lives, its residents are forced to witness the deaths of even young children. The character of Father Paneloux reminds the residents of Oran that they "must trust in the divine goodness, even as to the deaths of little children." And that the plague offered no "island of escape" between loving God or hating Him.Camus portrays the plague as symbolic of the struggles of life. Some seek to escape from the disease, some want others to suffer through it, and others are content to acknowledge the plague's existence and threat, but not to fixate on it.A great novel. Take time to read it.
