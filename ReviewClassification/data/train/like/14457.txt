I am a new Steven King fan, and an old one without even realizing it. I was delighted to learn that Steven King is quite funny, and he has a great sense of humor. His talent was very apparent even in this brief memoir, and I found myself growing a new respect for him as I turned each page. He spoke of stories that he had written, some that I did not even know were his such as The Green Mile. As an aspiring writer, his recommendations are very valuable and I wish that I had picked up this book before spending thousands of dollars on books, seminars and writing retreats. He puts everything that you really need to know into perspective and then hands you the permission to go and write and follow your own path. I loved it! I have since downloaded two more of his books, and I hope to continue to learn from his genius.
