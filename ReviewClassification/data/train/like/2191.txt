As a three year old (in Germany, in 1969, thus in the same year the book was published), I absolutely adored Eric Carle'sThe Very Hungry Caterpillar(or I should rather say that I loved the German version of the book,Die kleine Raupe Nimmersattand that I have in fact only read the English version but this once, being last week, at our local library). And if I rate the book with my memories of childhood and my inner child in mind,The Very Hungry Caterpillaris and always will be a full and glowing five stars for me. Yes, as an adult, I do indeed and well understand that the main "protagonist" that the very hungry caterpillar is never in any manner textually and narratively developed as a character, that he remains rather flat and one-dimensional throughout, and that he also consumes mostly food products that are not even remotely suitable for caterpillars (as they basically eat mostly leaves). However, I also and absolutely know and realise for a fact that when I was three years old (and hadDie kleine Raupe Nimmersattrepeatedly read to me), whether the list of foods the caterpillar was eating was suitable and acceptable for butterfly larvae or not did not matter all that much to me, and that for the intended audience, both the text and the accompanying images ofThe Very Hungry Caterpillarare generally pure unadulterated joy, magic, even perfection, with the final illustration, the beautiful and intensely coloured butterfly into which the erstwhile very hungry caterpillar morphs, being the ultimate icing on a delicious cake (and no food based pun is intended here).And I do have so very many fond memories of both my mother and grandmothers repeatedly and always gladly readingThe Very Hungry Caterpillarto me (in German), with my most special and evocative, precious recollection being my mother's mother taking the time to meticulously and slowly explain that caterpillars do not eat chocolate cake and ice cream cones (that they consume leaves and grass, that chocolate and most of the other foods mentioned in the book would actually and likely make the caterpillars sick) when I asked if I could feed chocolates to the caterpillars in the garden. So I guess with my remembered and recalled question to my grandmother in mind, I should perhaps offer this small caveat to parents that they might consider also letting their young children know that caterpillars do not eat most of the food products mentioned and depicted inThe Very Hungry Caterpillar, lest they are like me and are curiously wondering whether the caterpillar's presented and depicted consumption is realistic (and yes, I really did want to try and feed chocolates and ice cream cones to the caterpillars I had seen in grandmas's garden and was a trifle disappointed at my grandmother's answer to my question).
