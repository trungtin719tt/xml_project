I am going to say 4.5 stars. In the beginning I thought it was a little dull. It was making me weary and sleepy reading it. I actually stopped in the middle of chapters because I couldn't read anymore. I hate that! I kept moving, though. I am determined to finish this trilogy. I should have known this book would have taken me longer to read than expected. The movies took me nine days to finish. Don't judge. I was pregnant during that time and very sleepy.I am very glad I kept going, because the last half of the book was amazing. My heart still hurts for the company. The book was written very well. It was beautiful. The world that Tolkien created amazes me. The scenery was so beautiful that the imagery I thought up stung my eyes. How did he come up with the places and people? How/where did he get the imagery? It was so detailed that it simply baffles me. I can't even describe a place that is real, let alone imagine a whole tree city. I could imagine all the scenes. All the travels. Sometimes it was information overload, but it was great. Even in the first half of the book there was that looming evil presence of the Riders that kept me enticed to know what happened. Sometimes I looked over my shoulder to see if I was being watched. You can't get any better than that.So, I don't think I can trust shadows anymore. Thanks Tolkien! Can't wait to start the next part of the journey.
