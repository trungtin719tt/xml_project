^My thoughts on having to waita whole yearfor the next book. I've been so pleasantly surprised by my long-awaited January sequels, firstThrough the Ever Night, thenEverbound... and nowProdigyhas come in and turned a series I was on the fence about into one where I anxiously obsess over what will happen in the next installment. Marie Lu really focuses on developing her characters here, whilst still exploring the politics of her dystopian society and introducing one really evil twist to this story.The highlight of this book, for me, was Anden. I am delighted with how Lu handled his character and made her story so much more complex than a simple battle of good vs evil. This novel asks the question: who are the good guys? And you keep changing your mind about the answer.The journey we are taken on here is fast-paced, we see Day and June divided over their loyalties to different people as they team up with the Patriots to carry out an assassination plot on the new Elector Primo. The map gets a little bit bigger too and we start to get a clearer picture of what the rest of the world is up to at this point and just how this society was formed. This is information I was longing for inLegendand was disappointed not to get it, but I am just relieved that this is one of those cases where the author actually knows what she's doing. She knows why and how her dystopian society came into being and doesn't throw around empty words like "rebellion" and "war" hoping that will be enough to satisfy her readers.I was one of the minority that didn't feel much either way for June and Day inLegend, I liked them enough because they didn't annoy me or anything like that but I thought there was a lack of character development. No such problem here. I feel like this second book tests them as people and challenges their ability to trust each other, the battle is a much more psychological one than in the first book and this allows us to see sides of their characters that we didn't know before. And Lu doesn't stop there. There are so many characters inProdigythat become more important, more developed. Tess begins to doubt Day's loyalty, Kaede is hilarious and I love her spirit and Anden is just brilliant.And the ending. Oh my god,THE ENDING. I just can't, no, no, no... you can't just do something like that!!! Part of me loves that Marie Lu went there and part of me is freaking out.(view spoiler)[She can't actually kill him, right? *sob* She better not.(hide spoiler)]Book three, I need thee.
