Okay so I'm going to be honest, I was a little bored with this one early on when it was just mostly Cress and Thorne wandering around the desert, but then HOLY CRAP this book got good!There was so much going on in this and it was so exciting and I just loved the way all the characters' story lines were all tied in with each other, and literally just this story is so gripping. I love it. I love all of the characters. Their each so unique and wonderful and flawed and beautiful and swing all of them together and how they interact is like watching a perfect symphony. I don't even know if I'm being coherent right now, but I really don't care. This book punched me right in the feels.I'm not going to spoil anything but it was also kind of heartbreaking at times, and I'm really anxious for a certain person who's still apart from the group. She needs to catch a break, like seriously.And I am SO intrigued by Winters character! She's like space Luna and I love it. We only got a couple glimpses of her here, but I can't to read Winter now and get MORE!Anyway, rambling over. I loved this. On to the next one!
