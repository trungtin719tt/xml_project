No. 199 on the BBC's Big ReadHoley Shit. Okay, I don't really know what to say about this er... book, because I must've been about five when I first read it. I'm working my way up the BBC's Big Read, and so I re-read it. Except I genuinely feel lost for words, and trust me when I tell you, that never happens. However, I do remember enjoying the book as a kid, so I'm going to let my original rating stay. (Also, food porn, anyone?)Anyway, so we have a very hungry caterpillar here, and he eats through a bunch of food through the course of the book. He only eats like small, tiny bites of everything, but then again, the glutton that he is, he eats everything, from apples to Swiss cheese to chocolate cake.(view spoiler)[SPOILER ALERT: He finally becomes a butterfly.(hide spoiler)]P.S. I remember having read an Enid Blyton story, that was kind of similar to this, as a kid. And I remember having liked it more. I think it was called the Caterpillars' Party or something.
