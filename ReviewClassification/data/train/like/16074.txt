Beastly just goes to show that you can be beautiful of the face,but be a monster inside. I loved this up to date retelling of beauty and the beast.it was very well written.This was the very first beast that I felt not pity for at first,but as I found out about him I started to understand him better,that's the sign of a great storyteller.Adrian hides himself in a apartment with only his housekeeper Magda and his blind tutor will.The only pleasure he has is a greenhouse were he grows rose's,but when he finds a robber their he tells him he will let him go if he brings his daughter Linda to him.When Adrian see's her he realizes she's the girl he gave the rose corsage to a year ago on the night that the witch kendra cursed him.Linda is Adrian's last chance to break the spell before he remains the beast forever!
