This is my BESTSELLER EVER!!! I started reading the Bible when I was still a High School student, on and off in college and through adulthood! But more and more so now! As in daily! And it is my source of wisdom, strength, guidance, everything. Because the bible is God-breathed! So go and start reading it daily you book worm! And after you've read all it's books, you can read it all over again and still get fresh revelations!
