What a fabulous year 2018 is turning out to be, as far as books are concerned. I had the pleasure of readingA Tree Grows in Brooklyn, by Betty Smith, for the first time this year. Same withThe Last Samurai, by Helen DeWitt. Fantastic novels, both of them, of course, and I had waited far too long. And now this. This!Crazy.I'm in love again. With a book. Again.
