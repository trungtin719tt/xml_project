IfBeowulfwas a High School flick, or Blockbuster Income Idea #165, by HollywoodHrothgar and his band of jocks are throwing a pool party at his new crib, and of course he didn't invite Stereotypical Hollywood Hero #5, the awkward, rejected, acne-ridden Grendel.Grendel is hurt and tries to take revenge on the drunken, loud cool kids by calling the cops on them. Heorot PD is a bunch of incompetent idiots, so Grendel gathers all his strength and courage, goes to Heorot and beats the shit out of the football team.Everyone who's watched one of the blockbuster high school movies knows anyone who is cool isobviouslyan asshole, so the crowd cheers at Grendel's justice.But then, just as our hero has showed the importance of standing up for yourself,Beowulfshows up (enter shouts ofhe doesn't even go here) and breaks the poor soul's arm.Asshole Beowulf and his friends laugh in merriment, but Mama Grendel is not having it.She comes to beat the crap out of Beowulf, who ends up fighting her in the Grendel household, and as the asshole he is, beats the sweet lady full of motherly love.And because the world is an unfair place, Beowulf becomes homecoming king (of the Geats). The audience is enraged, they throw popcorn at the movie screen, how can that jackass get it all in the end, where's his comeuppance, I need my closure!So Beowulf, that delinquent, goes to fight a hardworking dragon, who works hard to put gems on the hoard and manflesh on the table for his kids. But does Beowulf care? He wants to rob the treasure to waste on mead and wenches.But the closing credits are coming, Beowulf gets what's coming to him, the dragon heroically dies whilst killing Beowulf, bringing justice to the Grendels.*crowd cheers*And so ends the stor... What do you mean, we got it wrong? Meh, it sells.
