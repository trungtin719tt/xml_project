For a few years in my early-20s I was obsessed with this book. Some of these stories I have read probably 10 times. The opening story ('Tlon, Uqbar, Orbius Tertius') is one of the most challenging, rewarding mind-f**ks in all literature. Borges's style is limited - this becomes clearer in his later work - but for me this collection is well-chosen. Rarely has so much innovation been crammed into so short a space - but innovation of the controlled kind. No displays of histrionics for this Argentine; his stories are well-wrought and concise. Every story or essay seems to focus on a paradox and explode it.Is it only me or does anyone else see a bit of Borges in Philip K. Dick? And why are the Borg (Star Trek: The Next Generation) called the Borg? I mean, the librarian inThe Name of the Rosewas called Jorge for a reason. What I'm saying is these days Borges's influence seems to be everywhere. Or is it just that he condensed so many ofthekey themes in literature down to such a fundamental state that now it seems as if he owns them?A pre-post modernist without whom I doubt Eco or Italo Calvino could have turned out as they did, Borges is everything that's good about those two younger Italians condensed down into something you can swallow. In the mind-bending short story stakes only Edgar Allan Poe comes close. Life-changing.
