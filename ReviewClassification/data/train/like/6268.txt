One of my all time favorite books. Hard at times, bloody, but if you love the outdoors, and dogs, try it.****The above was my original "minimalist" review of this book.****Actually the book doesn't require much of a review beyond, "great book". However as a friend here noted she's just reading it my mind was drawn back to it.As noted below I grew up on a small farm and didn't have access to a lot of novels. I had 4 my parents had given me as gifts over time and our school had a small library. There wasn't a public library nearby. I found this (andCall of the Wild) in the school library. I would have been about 11 I think.I love dogs. I'd lost a couple of dogs by that time (country living was still more of a dose of reality then).White Fangis the story of a young half wolf from his birth on.(view spoiler)[ In many waysCall of the WildandWhite Fangare the opposite of each other one the story of a dog becoming a wolf in the wild the other a story of a half wolf coming to love a man.(hide spoiler)]I grew to love this book. I read and reread it. Later I bought it and kept it on my shelves. I may have read the print off a few of its pages.If I "liked"Call of the WildI loved this book. It is the second novel in my life that I read over and over and I recommend that if you haven't read it you try it.I'm not a dyed in the wool London fan, that said I like many of his outdoor tales (even if I don't agree with many of his views). Here I think is a masterful though simple book. I highly recommend it.
