"And then one night, like a complete idiot, I told her how I felt."THANK YOU....to my friend Coment, for giving me book -in the pool- no less!....I enjoyed the unique romance:"I love this song!"... [ME TOO...."Time After Time", by Cyndi Lauper]....Art3mis shouted.Her eyes darted toward the dance floor. I looked at her uncertainly. "What's wrong?" she said with mock sympathy. "Can't a boy dance?""She abruptly locked into the beat, bobbing her head, gyrating her hips. Then she pushed off from the floor with both feet and began to float upword, drifting toward the groove zone. I stared up at her, temporarily frozen, mustering my courage"."All right". I muttered to myself. "What the hell."....I enjoyed the nostalgia ...(some things I didn't know what the author knew -at all -being a very UN-GEEK-GIRL ....but Packman???....NOW WE'RE TALKING MY LANGUAGE). Paul and use to save quarters for our 7-11 trips to play Ms. Packman ---on days we got a little more classy-- we went to a Mexican Restaurant that had a Ms. Packman machine. We ordered margaritas, chips and salsa. We were in Ms. PackmanHeaven. It was a great Sat. Afternoon date for us.....I loved the hunt to find the Easter Egg........I liked the good and evil characters --....Haliday - the guy who died - creator of OASIS....was the most fascinating 'dead' character. The fantasy of him being able to see what everyone was doing since he died was heartwarming.I loved how I felt.... Like a teenager with raging hormones! -- and I'm clearly not a nerd!It also gave me an appreciation for the 'positives' for where we are with technology today. As much as their are dangers with social media - their are many wonderful fulfilling friendship-connections.Tons of fun!!!
