So. I read this for the first time since 5th grade.As a kid, the romance between Kit &amp; Nat gave me great anxiety. I really wanted them to end up together. The idea that they might not was excruciating because it was SO OBVIOUS!!! that they were the OTP of this book...so when I picked it up again after so many years, I remembered little else about the story.But as an adult, two things stand out: the relationship between Kit &amp; her uncle Matthew, &amp; the complete lack of sexual menace in a period rife with that particular issue.I really liked the way Kit &amp; Matthew's interactions developed. They butt heads over huge differences in ideology, both religious &amp; political; Kit makes no apologies for having owned slaves in the past (which is great -- no overly sanitized 21st century disease) &amp; she doesn't understand her uncle's Puritan obsession with work, work, work for the enjoyment of working. Matthew, meanwhile, thinks Kit is too lazy &amp; needs supervision to finish basic chores (which she does); her religious training is lax (which it is); her flouting convention sometimes goes too far (which it does). But for all that, he's clearly a good man. He takes her in, treats her as equal to his daughters, &amp; stands up for her in public -- all of which Kit gradually comes to appreciate. Reading between the lines, we also see how Matthew comes to esteem her 'wild' instincts of charity &amp; inclusion, &amp; I thought they were very realistic in terms of guardian &amp; ward. By the close of the book they still don't agree on everything, but they do respect each other.That said, this is clearly a book for younger readers. None of the male characterseverthinks or behaves in any way improper, no matter their age or role in the story. There's no exploration of the sexual jealousy that was so important to the Salem-area paranoia -- particularly with young, pretty 'witches' like Kit, who were frequently charged with wantonly tempting the so-called upstanding male citizens. It's not that there wasn't plenty of room for these elements in the storyline -- rather, they were nonexistent. Likewise, Kit's adventures could well be the outline for an excellent bodice ripper -- but the author glossed over much of the peril inherent in her story. It's a book which would take only a small nudge to turn into a gripping ripper-style novel for adults...but it's a young adult read from 40+ years ago, so that nudge is simply not there.It's not that I demand every book flaunt a score of hardcore ripper themes, but when the plot presents SO MANY opportunities &amp; ignores them...well, that's disappointing to my sophisticated eyes of adulthood.** Certainly I loved this book as a 5th grader. Nowadays I call it an enjoyable light read &amp; give 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up for the sake of nostalgia. (I still love that beautiful red cover, though. It's one of my favorites.)**Says the girl who will never give up herGhostbustersdvd. Never, dammit.That's a big twinkie.
