It was a nice change of pace to go from books about world domination, destruction and lots of deaths and suffering to something much more relaxing and laid back. And though i admit it was a bit weird to read about clans of cats fighting, talking, having vision it was quite fun. Also being a big fan of Jack London in my younger days helped quite a bit.The story is nicely written, the pacing is also quite right and the story moves at a nice clip never being boring.So dig right and ignore the mousey aftertaste :P
