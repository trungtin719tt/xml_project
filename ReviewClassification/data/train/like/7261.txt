I have read hisWertherpreviously, so was familiar with his Sturm und Drang, but there he created a tragic hero, here it is something different.Exquisite words conduce to exquisite generation, where (I'm reminded of Virgil) each word is child of that preceding and parent to the procession. It has the gravity of a great opera, the lucid and disturbed poignancy of a ShakespeareanLolitaand chills more often than it warms.Faustreaches into disheartening epistemology and other philosophic despair, making politics from theosophy. It is beautiful.
