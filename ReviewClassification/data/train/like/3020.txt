I choose this book as it's widely regarded as a classic children's book. Although it is considered to be a bedtime story- a rhyme about a childs bedtime ritual of saying goodnight to everything they can see from their bed- I believe that the short rhyming couplets about subjects that most children would be familiar with make it an ideal book for building literacy skills. Although the edition I read was a board book, it is also availbe in paperback and hardback formats which would probably be more suitable for a school setting (as children tend to think that board books are for babies and will avoid them on that basis). I've offered to read this book to my nieces and nephews at bedtime on a number of occaisions and it never gets refused!Although the illustrations are maybe not as sophiscated as in more modern books, I think they are probably just as enchanting for a child today as they were for a child over 60 years ago when it was first published. In each of the 'wide-angle' illustrations of the bedroom, everything mentioned in the text is visable even though it may take a little searching for! This is a great way to encourage a child to relate the illustrations to the text. The colour scheme of the illustrations is also very unusual but interesting and sets the style of the book apart from it's more modern counterparts.All in all, I think that this book is a charming, timeless and classic childrens book that should be a staple of any child's library!
