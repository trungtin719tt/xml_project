Truly an oldie but a goodie! I read this years ago for the very first time &amp; just reread it a few weeks ago. I remember being obsessed with the series that followed ...Madolyn Smith (as Tracy) and Tom Berenger (as Jeff) in the 80s ... OMG!!! I feel OLD!!!I still own the series on VHS (!!!) from all those years ago and recently purchased it on DVD as well.Awesome characters! Great story! Both [the book and the series] are a must for any Sidney Sheldon fan!
