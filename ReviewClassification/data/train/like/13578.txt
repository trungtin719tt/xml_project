As the French would say: "Jules Verne, c'est un des incontournables." This means he is an author that one should neither miss nor want to miss. Verne is a great prophet of a better future and the wonder of the planet we live on.Verne wrote delightful youth novels in which he attempted to add enough factual information to his novels so that parents could legitimately consider the time the child spent reading them to be of educational value. Had Verne put less factual material in this books, the parents might have insisted that their child spend his or her time studying Latin instead.Verne has two important messages for the young person. The first is that the world contains many wonderful things outside of what we meet in our daily routines as middle class adults or children. Accordingly we should throughout our lives take time to travel and study about the great creation that we live in.Verne's second great message is that we should be optimist for the future. Man is constantly inventing new things that will make our world better. Our possibilities are endless. One day we may even be able to take a rocker to the moon, cross a continent in a balloon, even visit the moon or as this book tells us circumnavigate the globe underwater.In this book Verne presents the marine life in all of the world's oceans and the related taxonomy in a way that fascinates the young readers. He also explains the major problems involved in building underwater craft: maintaining oxygen supplies, water pressure, lighting, ventilating, powering and propelling. If only there were writers today who could turn technical issues into such lively entertainment.Children should keep reading Jules Verne books until they cease to be fun. Adults who did not read Verne in their youth might consider reading one to feel the giddiness of Verne's earnest optimism. 20000 leagues under the sea is as good a choice as any as a sample of Verne's works.(less)
