The Last Song is by far so much better than the movie. Hands down. There are so many details that were not done in the movie that Sparks truly made the book feel complete and perfect.Since Nicholas Sparks wrote it, it is already a given that it will be sad. He always adds a dramatic twist at the end of his books, which is why I enjoy reading them! I will not spoil what happens but he gives indications early on as to what will occur so it becomes predictable. However, the ending of this book is so bittersweet and adorable that made me love it even more. What bothers me is that this book is not only about a romance as what the movie depicts it to be. This book is about rebuilding a relationship between father and daughter. Their relationship as the book continues becomes genuine and beautiful. It makes you truly value one's own relationship with their parents. It took a few chapters to really get into it but by the middle I could not put it down til the end. A must read for everyone. I definitely recommend it to all. And bevare you are going to cry-A LOT!Of course, If I could change one thing about this book, I wouldn't want it to be so predictable, especially when it got towards the end. But The Last Song is a page turner! I enjoyed reading it and I believe anyone who reads it will enjoy it as well! Sparks does a fabulous job writing this novel it is a love story that also ties in how people can have family problems as well as trouble with friends. Not to mention it is an easy read and everyone can connect to at least one aspect this book has to offer.
