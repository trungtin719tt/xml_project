Okay, even though I haven't been a teen for a couple of years (uhm, make that over a decade), I'm a HUGE fan of the House of Night series. (Rather obvious, considering I bought it on the date of its release) Marked, Betrayed and Chosen were superb! That said, I really enjoyed Untamed, but if I had to order the books according to preference - it'd be fourth on my list.I eagerly await Hunted. And the twists and turns I anticipate (and can't even imagine) will result from the events in Untamed. (Nope, no spoilers from me).
