Oh, VC Andrews. I love how you've been dead for 20 years and somehow found the time to write 600 new books. This isn't one of those books, though. You actually wrote it! This is a magical tale of Cathy and her magical romance with her brother. Intrigued? Of course you are. It also features a money hungry mother, a crazy grandma who whips them and poisons them with arsenic, and a dead kid (died from ARSENIC poisoning! Who did THAT? Oh, right. It was the mother that poisoned them, not the grandma. What an evil bitch!) Let's see. They escape from the attic finally. The end. Or IS IT?
