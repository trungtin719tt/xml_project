Here's me acknowledging the power of John Green. &amp; hats off!No, this one is not as bittersweet as "The Fault in Our Stars", but still, this is unputdownable supreme! Its the type of literature that gets one excited about reading, about reminiscing about adolescence and school. Because everyone has had a childhood, a first love, a stage of rebellion, this type of book strikes inner chords &amp; you swiftly become infected with the virus of nostalgia.To read one of his novels is to remember that you were once new &amp; naive, too!
