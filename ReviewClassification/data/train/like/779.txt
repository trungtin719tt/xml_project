This was my first time reading "Anne of Green Gables" and I thoroughly enjoyed it. This is a children's book, and so I was expecting a story with a lovely protagonist and some lovely and educating morals, and that's what I got. Anne is simply lovable from the very beginning where she's being fetched by Matthew on the train station to come live in Green Gables. She's highly enthousiastic about everything from the trees to the birds and the brook, and sometimes she was a bit too enthousiastic for my taste. Still, I loved her, because she was such a fierce and courageous little red-head at her age.I think that one thing about this book that appeals to children a lot is the fact that Anne has a vivid imagination. She can go on for pages about her thoughts and feelings while we, the readers, are waiting for the story to continue. I found those digressions very endearing, and they are definitely the reason why this children's book is actually over 400 pages long.The book turned into a narrative on Anne growing up, and each chapter became about a new episode in her life. That narrative style did become a bit too predictable for my taste, but in the end I still really liked this story because it warmed my heart and put a smile to my face.
