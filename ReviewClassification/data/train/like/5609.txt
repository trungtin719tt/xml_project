Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge #41: A Bestseller From the Year You Graduated High Schoolre-read March 2018yup, Nick and Amy are still two of the most fucked up characters I've ever had the pleasure of reading about. and I still love them.------------------------------------------WELL. HOLY SHIT.This book was insane. I was sort of spoiled by GIFs on Tumblr previous to reading the book, but I WAS STILL SO INTO IT. The ending was not at all what I was expecting, and I like that.(view spoiler)[ I thought either Nick or Amy would end up killing the other, but it ended up making sense for that not to happen(hide spoiler)]I seriously don't know how I'm going to pick up another book after this.
