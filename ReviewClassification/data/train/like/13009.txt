The most insidious form of prejudice is the one that's internalised and self-directed.The Bluest Eyeexamines the ways in which latent cultural measures of beauty and self-worth can become reinforced and self-perpetuating. White people figure rarely in the narrative, and yet whiteness is pervasive as the very currency of self-worth: a means of defining value, and of establishing one's own superiority over others. The novel digs out the dirt to examine the roots of this behaviour, but provides no comfortable resolution for the reader.This was my first Toni Morrison novel (and hers too). A beautiful and devastating book.
