SUCH A GREAT NOVEL THE SECOND TIME AROUND. I'm so happy I decided to reread Lady Midnight. I feel it really helped me get a better grasp on the plot and the characters. I feel so much more in love with this story (as if I was not the first time). I definitely cried so much AGAIN because of all the feels, and I think I have a new found appreciation for certain parts of the story! For example, the inclusion of neurodiverse people in such a conservative society really resonated with me. I was so happy to see these individuals standing tall against the stigma enforced by their superiors. I also believe my "ships" are more set in stone this time, as I was not totally committed to a lot of potential romances before. The story was just as powerful, the characters just as loveable, and I'm just gushing at this point because I love Lady Midnight so much. I'm so happy to see Cassie Clare growing so successfully, in her writing and creativity most of all. Now to wallow in sadness for the next SIXTY days while preparing for Lord of Shadows!I received a copy of this book from Simon &amp; Schuster in exchange for an honest review. All opinions are my own.
