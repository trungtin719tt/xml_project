Aside from the book being epically long, Pat Conroy is a great story teller. However I was disappointed with the climax of the book and a bit let down leading me to struggle to finish. But I did and thought that the biggest strength were the story elements that made me laugh, weep, get angry, etc. A good read if you are willing to commit to the length of the book.
