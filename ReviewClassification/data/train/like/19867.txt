The second of Herriot's wonderful memoirs of his veterinary practice in mid-twentieth century Yorkshire. As withAll Creatures Great and Small, his love for the place, the people, and the critters is palpable on every page. Recommended for everyone, especially animal lovers and Anglophiles. But be warned - some of the medical procedures are pretty gruesome.
