Update 6/9/12 ** some spoilers..** but if you haven't read this by now, shame on you. I know it's popular and over-saturated, but it's not Twilight...At all. Read it asap.Re-reading the series because...I just want to, darn it. I bought the books for that reason, right?It was for me, just as hang-on-to-your-hat as the first time. I should have put it down at 11 and went to bed, but no.The first 2/3 of the book isn't exciting at all. But really, in this terrible dystopian world, I think things had to get worse for Katniss before she decided that something had to be done. Things decidedly get worse.Her second worst nightmare happens: she's going back in the arena. Gah! I totally remember the first read through around that that was the last thing I expected.She realizes her first worst nightmare will probably come to pass in one way or another: there are going to be deaths. She can't protect everyone (major foreshadowing), but she'll die trying.I'll amend something I mentioned below: I do think this is maybe slightly better than HG. I can't really pin point it. It's a great book. Both are. HG introduces us to a world we can't imagine, and Catching Fire starts to show the cracks.The growing pains have begun. You can only suppress and oppress people for so long until they say "enough". Twelve districts live for the single benefit of the Capital.Did you get it the first time? She's the girl on fire, so they put in in the one place where fire can't burn: Water. And lots of it.I thought the idea of the clock was genius, not only in it's written execution but also in the metaphor. Your time is short. Your life is short.I think I even learned a thing or two about human nature.Also, don't pre-judge people. Of course, you're right 95% of the time, but 5% of the time, people will surprise you. They might be brave and noble hiding behind snobby and aloofness.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~(previous review)Loved it!!!Totally not what I expected, but a good story. Although not as jaw-droppingly good as the first book.Less action, especially in the first act of the book. Action picks up later, but is still not as good as the first one. Still, a good 'middle' book, for what I expect to be a trilogy. Provided a little more backstory, and certainly a lot more foreshadowing of what will be happening next.Can't wait for the next one!!!
