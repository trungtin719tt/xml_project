Many more readers if all ages are now enjoying the wide range of powerful stories written for YA audiences. Tuck Everlasting has remained one of my favorites.I'm writing this quick little review today because I learned the author, Natalie Babbitt, has just passed away and so her stories and the ways in which they touched my life are foremost in my mind today.I taught this book for many years as a fifth grade teacher and I hope it continues to be read by readers of all ages. It is a lyrical, philosophical book. Tadiana wrote such a beautiful review...it captivated me all over again. I'll reread the book tonight in tribute to Ms Babbitt.
