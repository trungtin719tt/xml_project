I LOVED IT!There's two main story lines:1)The Romance story (with wonderful well developed characters)2)Stop A major event in U.S. History (its all well plotted throughout the book)Both mixed together in some very intelligent--satisfying ways.Stephen King knows how to blend the supernatural with history better than your average author. (celebrates nostalgic also without being sassy about it).I'm often not a fan of time travel fiction reading ---but Stephen King improves this type of storytelling by adding themes, choices, and consequences in his story. He does the butterfly effect trope creating ripples throughout time and improves on this by making time fight back, the past in 11/22/63 does not want to be changed."11/22/63" is easy page turning fun......And....At some point in your reading....You might want to take a break and enjoy**Pound Cake** for dessert! (this makes no sense to anyone unless you've read the book)..... :)
