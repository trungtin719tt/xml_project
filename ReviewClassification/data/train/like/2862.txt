A wonderful children's book. The Grinch not being the kind of person you'd really want to spend time with when the story opens, learns that here is much more to Christmas, than just packages, bows, and ribbons, not to mention feasts and roast beasts.And the world would have been an infinitely better place had Ron Howard never gotten his hands on this story.Really.
