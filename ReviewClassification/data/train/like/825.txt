Dracula: the amazing novel that inspired a ton of shitty stories.It is a story that is in the consciousness of all of us even if we have never read it. This was my first reading, and I was surprised at how much I liked it. It wasn't what I thought it would be, in a good way.Sure,Draculahas some problems. It is a whole lot of Christian propaganda, burly men sacrificing themselves for the sweet and virtuous women, and other such Victorian bullcrap. But, in the end, the sweet little lady that they all kept in the dark in order to prevent her from having swooning episodes from information they felt sure would disastrously affect her "lady nerves" ended up being the one they couldn't do without.The ending was rather abrupt, but it was also highly suspenseful. In fact, the entire novel was highly suspenseful. It has been quite a while since a book hooked me from Chapter 1.Highly recommended, especially for those of you who think that vampires are sparkly dudes with good hearts.
