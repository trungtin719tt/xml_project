Tricksters make this world...Lord to Mephisto: "And never come but finding fault always? Never a thing on earth gives you content?"The first conversation between the Lord and Mephisto begins with Mephisto's discontentment towards people in earth. He cannot understand the disparity between humans. The discontentment isn't really a discontentment but inability to accept the things the way they are. Isn't that ambition all about? He doesn't say that out loud but its given to him as an answer by the lord.The very foundation of Faust is based on the fact that an overtly ambitious man signs up his fate with dubious evil forces. For one to dream of the extraordinary and then to achieve, a compromise is made that leads them to inevitable downfall. They get corrupted, tainted, manipulated and eventually partially destroyed by the undoing of their own imagination. Faust and Mephisto make up this striking pair whose conversations reveal more of humanity and its idiosyncrasies. They are the two sides of the conversation, a pair of oddities stuck on the side for a long ride. It goes on. The devil nudges when the human nature fails to take the leap.Faust: A man who wonders why he cannot be God with all the possibilities of making one, surrounding him. In a society we need Faust and Quixote and Hamlet and Don Juan - the "overweeners" with their capacity to shift the thought process of the society to what it can achieve.
