What can I say? Except I loved Shiver and truth be told, I always fret a little bit about sequels. I mean, can an author capture that feeling of my first infatuation with a book? That delicious little feeling of "Wow, I have to keep reading this?"Well, I have to say that Maggie Stiefvater did. She did it all over again and I sit back amazed at her storytelling skills.This time around it's not just about Sam and Grace. There's more...in fact there are four POVs represented in the book. And while some might think that sounds confusing, I have to tell you that it was brilliant to read four POVs. Just brilliant.I won't spoil it for those who haven't read it yet. But I will say that I loved it. And I'm very very picky about wolf legends, in general, which is to say that I'm usually slightly bored by them. Not in this case. Not at all. Maggie, you left me completely out of breath when I turned that last page. In fact, I might have even uttered a "dammit" and I'm a mom of three who tries hard not to say these things. I just didn't want it to end. So now begins the wait. The one year long wait until the final installment, Forever, is released. What a very long year that will be.
