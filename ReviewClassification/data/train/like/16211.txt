I read this for a class in middle school and couldn't stand it, but a few years later I decided to try it on my own -- for fun.(*inhales*)It is incredible. It is amazing.How could I have hated it?! It is literally ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS EVER.I need to reread this again, soon. And then continue with the rest of the series. ^_^
