Sometimes you happen to find the right book at the right moment in your life and it just seems to fall into a place in your mind and fill a space so perfectly like a puzzle piece.Siddhartha is a man with three talents: he can think; he can wait; he can fast. When asked what is the good of fasting, he replies:It is very good, sir. If a person has nothing to eat, then fasting is the wisest thing he can do. If, for instance, Siddhartha had not learned how to fast, he would have to accept any service today, whether with you or someone else, for hunger would force him to do so. But now Siddhartha can calmly wait, he knows no impatience, he knows no plight. He can stave off hunger for a long time and he can laugh at it. That, sir, is what fasting is good for.Hesse has gotten right to the bottom of it. Fear is the destroyer of happiness. Paths taken out of desperation do not lead one to fulfillment. It is best to be patient and choose wisely.Siddharthais a story of discovery, of searching for meaning and finding one's way in life. It is filled with Buddhist mysticism, and despite this (I consider myself a strict scientific rationalist), I found this thoroughly insightful and thought provoking. It is not Siddhartha's mystical conclusions that are important, it is the process of self-discovery, the search for wisdom, the questions asked, the quest for what *truly* satisfies the spirit.Hermann Hesse is fast becoming one of my favourite writers. I lovedSteppenwolf, and the title characters in these two books could not be more different! Hesse writes with simplicity, yet manages to impart such depth of thought. This characters have a real internal life without being overly introspected or endlessly analytical.
