It has took me longer than usual to get through this book, but hell, there are so many amazing books to be devoured!The Three Musketeers is an exquisite adventure story, with the "Fun" element on overdrive! I mean, this is classic literature with a twist. I just loved the sword fights and the utter sarcasm. The writing style Dumas uses flows with such ease, and is very humorous. I found myself howling a lot more than I thought I would!I loved the relationship between the Musketeers and how very different each one is. We definitely have a bromance here!I see enjoyed the fact that the Musketeers just kicked ass, and in a highly debonair fashion.My favourite excerpt;"D'Artagnan, in a state of fury, crossed the antechamber at three bounds, and was darting towards the stairs, which he reckoned upon descending four at a time, when, in his heedless course, he ran head foremost against a Musketeer who was coming out of one of M. De Treville's private rooms, and striking his shoulder violently, made him utter a cry, or rather a howl."
