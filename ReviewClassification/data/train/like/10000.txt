Loving my reread of this series. Have SO many thoughts about these books, some of which have to do with the fact that there are portions that are difficult to take in as a modern reader, but I maintain its importance as "a book to read" on a variety of levels. This book in particular makes me want to pick up some other books that can give some wider historical context for the time in which it takes place.
