Re-read: 2014Things happen inBloodfever. Interesting things.But none of them matter.The only thing that matters is that Mac And Barronsfinallyhave a hotAngryMake-out session.Yep.That'swhat I took away from a 300 page book.*shrugs*Original review: 2009This book is even better than the first book in the series, Darkfever. I can't wait to read the next one! A big "Thank You" goes out to Jill for telling me to get all of the books at once, 'cause these cliffhanger endings would have killed me otherwise!
