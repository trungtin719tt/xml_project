My goal for the summer was to re-read Jane Austen's novels in their entirety. And I'm happy to say, I'm finished. It's been some time since I sat down to read any of her novels. I've probably watched the movies more than I've actually sat down to read them. I know many people do an annual reading of her works. I'm not sure I could do that - but would instead place them into the "read these books at different times of your life" category.It always amazes me how these novels still resonate today. For a female novelist of her time, Jane Austen was an incredibly smart, witty, and sarcastic personality. Her dry humor and observational skills are incredible.Her novels introduce us to a variety of characters, from the strong willed (Elizabeth Bennet) to the weakling (Fanny Price)women to the men we want to be with (Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy, Mr. Darcy) to the ones we could do without (Willoughby, anyone?). And you can't forget the comic foils, most often seen in the matron role of the book. We all know who we want to be, who we're cheering for, who we despise,and who we feel sorry for. There's a character for every person.I love these books for their relatablity. Their sense of hope, and their quoteability. I, personally, will be adopting the following for the coming year "It sometimes happens that a woman is handsomer at 29 than she was 10 years before."I don't know when my next Jane Austen reading will take place. But I look forward to seeing where I am, how I've changed, and if my favorites will be altered, compared to where I am today. I guess we'll just wait and see, and hope for the best.
