I love messy elf drama.Super excited to kick off my Tolkien re-reads with this one!I think I actually enjoyed this more the second time around! It can be, admittedly, a little bit dry at times and I definitely enjoy certain chapters/stories more than others, but... I adore the world, so it's always a fairly enjoyable read tbh. I picked up on things that I missed the last time I read it - it's just alittlebit lore heavy, so that's understandable.Also just about everyone has at least 2-3 names each, so trying to get my head around all of those is always an Experience.Next stop:The Hobbitand then I'mfinallygonna be re-readingThe Lord of the Ringsfor the first time in yeaaaaaars. I'm so excited!!
