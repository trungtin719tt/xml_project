Eddie was a veteran soldier who works in the maintenance at the carnival, making sure the rides are safe and in good condition. For years, his life was a routine and it's almost boring. On his 83rd birthday, an accident happened as he attempts to save girl falling from the roller coaster which took his life. Then he wakes up in heaven where his new journey begins. He meets five people that became part of his life. Some are related to him and some he barely knew until he was enlightened by their connection to him.Mitch Albom writes great inspirational stories and always leaves his readers with life lessons.Five People You Meet in Heavenwas an easy yet slightly emotional read. My tears welled up when Eddie met the last three persons in this book where he learned about forgiveness, long lasting love and peace. Overall, I really enjoyed this one but it's not my favorite (I still love his other book:For One More Day)
