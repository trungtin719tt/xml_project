When everyone first read and loved Harry Potter I ignored it. Not for any particular reason but about 10 years ago I didn't think I would be into it. Fast forward a decade and I'm now working my way through what I can say already is a children's classic fantasy series that is up there with The Wizard of Oz and The Chronicles of Narnia.Harry's existence with his Muggle uncle and auntie is as horrible as ever and he can't wait to get back to Hogwarts after speaking to a mini-elf masochist who essentially predicts his doom and travelling in an awesome magic-infused flying car. Upon returning to Hogwarts it's similar to before, Quidditch lessons, Malfoy being a bit of a tosser, Hermainie loving studying, and the wizarding threesome getting into all sorts of nonsensical antics. A new tutor is introduced this time, Professor Lockhart and I thought he was brilliant mainly due to how awful he was with his tall-tales and celebrity status! This narrative is brimming with ghosts, boys and girls who adore Harry, spiders, and Professor Sprout. The characters are pretty brilliant and I can easily understand why this is adored globally. I didn't need the continuous info-dumps that reminded me what happened in book one but apart from that there isn't really anything negative to say. The ending was surprising with a cool twist, a magic hat, a phoenix, a sword, a diary, and a giant snake. I hope you don't tell me off for these spoilers as I'm sure I'm the only fantasy book reviewer who hasn't read these yet. I'm loving the adventure so far. These books are what I go to for now when I want no-nonsense, uncomplex awesomeness. Love it.
