If you have seen the movie- forget it. Besides the names, it shares very little with RAH's study on why free men subject themselves to a loss of freedom in order to ensure freedom for others.This book greatly influenced me when I was a boy- and it still colors my thinking today- 35 years later.This should be on the reading lists of every high school.AFTERNOTE!I would like to correct what appears to be a common misconception about the society described in Heinlein's book:YOU DID NOT HAVE TO BE A MILITARY VET TO BECOME A CITIZEN!!!As RAH clearly stated, you had to be a veteran ofFEDERAL SERVICE. Which as RAH further stated could be something very much along the lines of the Peace Corps, AmericCorps, the WPA, the CCC, etc. The number of military vets as well as the size of the military itself is extremely small in comparison to "civilian" vets who made the overwhelming majority of the citizens and the the general population that military defended.
