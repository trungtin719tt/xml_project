My sister and I were so enamored of this book when we were little. With that in mind, I'll let my four-star rating stand. However, I recently ran across a copy of the book and thought it might be fun to read it again after all these years. Nostalgia and all that, right? I was sickened by the over-the-top flowery writing. Gaaaaag me with syrupy sentiment! I was also surprised by all the gooey religious references, which I didn't remember AT ALL from my childhood readings of it. I don't object to religion in books. It's part of the world in which we live. But Johanna Spyri was ridiculously preachy and gushing in her religious passages.Fortunately for me, revisiting the book cannot and did not spoil my happy memories with my sister, imagining we were Heidi of the Alps. :)
