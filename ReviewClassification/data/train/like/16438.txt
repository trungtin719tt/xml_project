Some books get into your senses. They fill your nose with the scent of a people, the lick of the sun on bare skin, the brazen gossip of silk sheets, or engulfs you with a composition of shadows that hints at something beyond line of sight.M.M. Kayeis a storyteller that makes you taste India. She takes her own life experience and, likeRudyard KiplingandFrances Hodgson Burnett, draws fairy tales in the sands of Southern India while tucked in at the bed of the Himalayans.This is not just a book for women, with its romance and its splendour, butErnest Hemmingwaywould be proud of the imagery used to explain the Sepoy Mutiny, the uprising of the colonised soldiers against the colonist generals. A contrast in textures, hard and soft, rough and smooth, creamy and quenching, sweet and savoury, all wrapped up in black and white.
