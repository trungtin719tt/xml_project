NERDGASM!!!!!!! Video games, movies and music from the 80's!My teenage years were spent during the 80's. I look through the pictures that were taken at that time and realize we could have been called a cheesy generation. This book saves us. This book makes us cool.I actually wanted to revisit those times after reading this book. It's not deep literature but it is pure fun. I smiled and cheered so many times reading Wade's story, even though you know how the book is going to end it is still a popcorn needing ride to get to that ending.I'm not going to bother telling you about the books story because other reviewers have done a wonderful job of that. I'm gonna gif spam you!(Every once in awhile I have to give the gif haters something to bitch about)
