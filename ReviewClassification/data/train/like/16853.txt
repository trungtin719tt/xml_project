Well, let me say this...very tough book to read. The author is a genius and use so much adjectives and descriptiveness. I mean, for instance, the Author spends a page and a half describing the sunset and its glory compared to their peril. Awesome book to read and is way different from the movie. A must read for hardcore readers.
