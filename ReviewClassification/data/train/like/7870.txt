I used to feel connected to Pippi as a kid. Because I had red/orange hair ;-) I was even called Pippi Langkous (the Dutch translation) sometimes then.. I swear I have this photo of myself as a kid, spitting image then, now my hair is white/orange mixed, I'm sure Pippi would have the same as an older and still eccentric lady? :-)I remember my mother, when I was a little kid, used to deck me out in a two piece suit, skirt and jacket and top it off with red stockings. I really used to hate that, didn't dare go out of the house LOL. And she made two ponytails sticking out of my head... Pippi revived :-)Most of all I loved her adventurous, free spirit. I have named our house 'Villa Kakelbont'.Lovely adventures, great stories! Astrid Lindgren really wrote great children's books, so adventurous, so out of the box. Loved the tv series too.
