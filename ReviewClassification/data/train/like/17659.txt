Forbidden was a book I thought would be easily forgettable, and I have never been so wrong. Throw out your moral compass and pick up this bookWhen I read what this story was about I was weirded out beyond belief... Brother and Sister get it on... No thank you, but after reading the reviews I finally put on my big girl panties and bought it. This book is like the show Shameless but with incest... Yeah I know still sounds insane! The character of this book couldn't have been written better. Maya and Lochan are character I find myself even struggling to sum up in words. (I will say I did end up calling him Loki the whole time so sorry about that Tabitha.) They are strong, they are weak, they are irrational, stupid, genius, wild, and so much more.I will warn you that this book did start off slow, took around 120 pages to start picking up. When it gets going though it doesn't stop. The last few chapters are the definition of a page turner. This had me laughing, praying, cheering, and then crying my eyes out. Never in my life did I think 1) I would read a book about incest or 2) that I would read a book about incest and end up in tears.The ending of this book has me so shell shocked and I don't think that feeling is going to be something I'll be able to shake off anytime soon.It is so rare to come across a book that make you feel so many emotion, makes you question your beliefs, and leaves you utterly breathless. This book is that book.I will probably have to come back and add more this this review later, or go more into detail on my blog, but right now I'm still just so surprised by how truly moving this book was.
