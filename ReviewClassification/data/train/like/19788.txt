Another my fave ofSidney Sheldonwith impressive 4.8 Stars.So Tricky.. this is what thief-ish book should be! I love reading the book with thief characters, but I have never read the book that have A LOT ofcleverrobbering plans. The robberies are complicated and very-well planned. I really admire Sheldon of how he can think and create them.TracyandJeffare such intelligent, smart, and sly characters and I love them! I also really enjoy theromancebetween these two. Tracy and Jeff are likerivalfor each other,their equal match. They outwit each other in the game of robbery. Yeah, I found myself giggle over their war. It's that cute!!This book remind me so much of Catspaw by Anne Stuart which the character is also the burglar. I think if you love Catspaw or thief-ish plot, you might also love this book and vice versa. Really recommend! :)
