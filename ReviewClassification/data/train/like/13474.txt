Review posted on 10/16/2012CLICK HERE TO READ MORE REVIEWS AT READING, EATING AND DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORFAt first, I wasn't quite sure how I felt about Reflected in You by Sylvia Day. Honestly, the beginning of this novel drove me crazy. It reminded me of the Fifty Shades trilogy by E.L. James. In addition, Eva was a whinny pushover and Gideon was a silent, selfish bastard. Their relationship was basically at a standstill for the first half of this novel. They avoided all of their problems and used sex as a replacement for talking, a way to avoid the real issues, and a way to deal with arguments. I felt like the characters and their relationship were going nowhere. I just wanted to scream at the characters, especially Gideon. Eva said it best when she said, "I get two answers from him: Trust me and wait."At about 70% or so things really picked up. It was like BAM! Eva picked herself up off of the floor, grew a pair, and showed everyone that she wasn't a weak, whinny plaything after all. I really admired her attitude and, quite frankly, her audacity. Gideon, unfortunately, remained silent. The story line also became a lot more intense and exciting. And, I absolutely loved the way this book ended. The big speech at the end, given by someone who is not a main character, was hands down the best part of this book. The wheels were turning in my mind the whole time they were talking and everything clicked into place. It wrapped up this book nicely.Gideon and Eva made some progress in this novel. Granted, it didn't happen until the last 30% or so of this book, but I'm glad there was some improvement, individually and together. There is still a whole lot for them to work through and I'm very curious to see how this series concludes.Again, the beginning of this novel really reminded me of Fifty Shades, but I will say this, the author did a great job of moving away from Fifty Shades at the end of this novel. I think the conflict and the dramatic ending really made this book stand apart.I gave Reflected in You (Crossfire #2) by Sylvia Day 4 STARS. Ms. Day is an extremely talented author. Reflected in You is a SEXY adult romance novel that will captivate readers. I strongly recommend this series to adults who like domineering men, wounded characters, and emotional roller coasters.-XOXOREADING, EATING AND DREAMINGWritten on 5/4/2012I really don't like to be negative, but I can't let this go...All I could think about after I finished Bared to You, the first book in the Crossfire series, was how freaking similar Bared to You by Sylvia Day was to the Fifty Shades series by E.L. James. Since I have finished reading Bared to You, I have noticed the "alternate" Bared to You book cover and the Reflected in You book cover - both covers, in my opinion, are Fifty Shades knock offs. To be frank, I am really mad about this. I know Fifty Shades isn't "my" series so I don't have any right to get mad over this...but COME ON!!!! The characters, plot, etc. from Bared to You are just like the characters, plot, etc. from Fifty Shades. Wasn't that enough? Did the author/publisher/whoever really have to have the same freaking book covers too?Am I overreacting? Does this bother anyone else?
