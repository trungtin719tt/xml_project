"Cry havoc and release the dogs of war"The recent uproar over the Play in the Park version of the play. Huey Long, Margret Thatcher, Tony Blair, Barrack Obama, Kennedy, Jacqueline Kennedy (as Calpurnia) all had their moments in the play as Caesar without the uproar. I can see the make Rome/America great again, but I do not see Trump refusing the crown thrice or leaving 75 drachmas to every man or donating his private gardens and orchards. It's just a play.
