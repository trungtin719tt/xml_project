I think I have a crush on John Steinbeck. But even if I met him somewhere -- a cocktail party, a barbeque, even my own bookstore -- I don't think I'd talk to him. Maybe make eye contact in a brave and silent way. Sometimes I get the feeling that he is friendly and easy-going, compassionate and kind, and really interested in people in general and persons in particular ... but I know that he is deeply brilliant, and I would say something ridiculous that I would turn over and over in my head (mentally, to myself) for years. Like I did with A.M. Homes, and she's nowhere near as brilliant, and gives off nary an aroma of friendliness.When I finished this book the other day, I went through my favorite ritual of writing my name and the month and year on the first page of the book, and went to shelve it alphabetically among its fictional brothers. While I was there, I pulled out the other Steinbeck novels to find out when I first read them; most of them are dated 1993. I had forgotten that I owe my discovery of Steinbeck to my friend Erica, who read East of Eden in 8th grade, when I was still churning through Nancy Drew, Mary Higgins Clark and V.C. Andrews. I was inspired and intimidated by Erica's reading lists ... she was reading Kerouac and Ginsberg when she was 13. Maybe before, with her parents. Who knows? I wasn't ready to tackle East of Eden yet, but I picked up a copy of Of Mice &amp; Men/Cannery Row ... and then The Wayward Bus, and Burning Bright, and Sweet Thursday ... and loved them all. But it wasn't until this year that I picked up the big ones -- Grapes of Wrath, good God! And The Winter of Our Discontent ... here's my favorite sentence, from the beginning of Chapter 15:"It was a day as different from other days as dogs are from cats and both of them from chrysanthemums or tidal waves or scarlet fever."Yay. Today, fifteen years after the seed was planted, I begin East of Eden.
