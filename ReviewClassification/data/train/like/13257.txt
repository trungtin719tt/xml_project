The. Best. Friggin'. Series. I've. Read. In a long long long long long (you get the picture) time. I was thrilled. Super-excited. Impressed. So glad someone restored my faith in believing there could still be good books in the world. Thank you, Kelley Armstrong. You did great.I can't express with words how superb this book (and series) was. Everything about this book appealed to me. The likeable characters, the imaginative plot, the way how thelove trianglewas portrayed, even though it wasn't even a love triangle. I cheered for Derek right from the start and I loved how Chloe had no clue(view spoiler)[she actually really likes him. Loves, even.(hide spoiler)]I'm glad I stumbled upon this series. Even though the characters' age was a little too young for my taste, I enjoyed the read anyway. Loved loved loved the book.And I have a feeling that this wasn't the end. I'm sure we're in for a pleasant surprise. I certainly hope so. :)
