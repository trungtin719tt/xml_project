Last autumn friends from Texas visited. We had a wonderful time, so when they left after two weeks we really missed them. Just before christmas a package arrived with some gifts from Texas. The best part was this Childrens classic. I never even knew it was a book, beside the film. Shame on me.The Polar Express is a story about a boy who travels to the north pole with the polar express train. He receives the first christmas gift from Santa. And it's a very special gift for true believers:'I shook the bell. It made the most beautiful sound my sister and i had ever heard. But my mother said, "Oh, that's too bad." "Yes," said my father, "it's broken." When I'd shaken the bell, my parents had not heard a sound. 'It's a magical story, that will appeal to every child. With beautiful illustrations, adding to the christmas mood. Beautiful story. My kids agree. Although i had to translated to Dutch. They now believe in Santa, who normally does not visit The Netherlands.
