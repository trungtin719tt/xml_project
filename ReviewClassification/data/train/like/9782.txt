An absolute must-read for science fiction fans!Arthur C. Clarke was certainly ahead of his time, considering that the book was published a year before we actually put men on the moon in 1969. I think that adds even more astonishment to his writing and his imagination.Reading this book in 2018 makes me appreciate it even more.
