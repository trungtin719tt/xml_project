When a Mother Bird leaves the nest to find food for her yet-to-hatch egg, little does she know that the Baby Bird will be on a mission to find his mother right off the bat. With no one in the nest, Baby Bird begins a search around, seeking out his mother. Not a kitten, a hen, a cow or a dog... and on goes the search for his mother. Further explorations prove fruitless, but Baby Bird is soon reunited with his mother and finds all the happiness he could want. Neo chose this as his final bedtime book, having heard it before in a previous collection. He thought it funny to see all the different mother possibilities that Baby Bird had before locating his rightful mother.
