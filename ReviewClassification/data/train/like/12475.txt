Quickie review:-This book contains my favorite non-fellowship character: Faramir. His family situation is dealt with more in the next book, but the fact that he turned out so good and fair, as shown in this book, makes me just love him. He is badass when necessary and wise when that is necessary, and generally gets to the point with only a minimum of the usual plethora of talk first.- There's one single named woman in this book, and that's Eowyn. She got short shrift in this book, much like Arwen does in the whole series, but at least her time is coming soon.- Ents! Compared to the movie, where Merry and Pippin basically have to manipulate the Ents into going to war against Saruman, the Ents decide all on their own, and pretty quickly too.- Battles. Helms Deep and Isengard were such small potato battles in this book. The movies definitely do them better justice, though it would have been awesome if they'd kept the Huorns in. :DI do love this book though. I love Rohan as a whole, and love the regiment at Osgiliath where we meet Faramir. The second half, with Frodo and Sam, drags a bit, but it's necessary. We can't just skip them.On to The Return of the King!
