I love you, Sarah Dessen!"Along For the Ride" is about a girl called Auden, who just finished high school and is spending the summer before college visiting her dad and his new wife and newborn baby in their beach town. Auden has insomnia and spends her nights aimlessly driving around, until she meets Eli, who also can't sleep at night, and they start hanging out together.This is the PERFECT book for reading at the pool or the beach. One of my favorite 'summer-feel' books."That was one of the things about the night. Stuff that would be weird in the bright light of day just wasn't so much once you passed a certain hour. It was like the dark evened it all out somehow.""The night changed things, widening out the scope. What we said to each other, the things we did, they all took on a bigger meaning in the dark."I love how this book encourages you to be ALL THE THINGS. Just because you're girly and like the color pink, doesn't mean you're dumb. I feel like that's a stereotype many people have about girls."Who says you have to be either smart or pretty, or into girly stuff or sports? Life shouldn't be about the either/or. We're capable of more than that, you know?""Maybe it was true, and being a girl could be about interest rates and skinny jeans, riding bikes and wearing pink. Not about any one thing, but everything."I loved this book, and I absolutely recommend it. But read it in the summer. ;)
