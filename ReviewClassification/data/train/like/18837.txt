Not quite 3 stars, but I'm rounding up because the story overall is much better the second time around. Or maybe I reread it at the right moment and it just clicked.Whatever it is about this book, I get it now. I get why people gravitate to these cozy reads and atmospheric small-towns. There's a pleasant way about the writing that makes you want to settle in and stay awhile and learn all about the town and the people and the food, and there's a sense of peace and serenity that you wish you could take back with you to the real world.I didn't get it before, but I do now.
