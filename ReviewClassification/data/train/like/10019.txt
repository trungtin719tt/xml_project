I told you America.......those vipers who can wear 7-inch heels are deadly.Honestly, who cares if it's only down to six girls now??!! They're still vipers. They can still walk on crazy heels without breaking their feet. They're still WOMEN WHO WILL CHALLENGE YOU TO A CAT-FIGHT.Now you guys see how dangerous and how awesome this book is.America still fights with herself and others for Maxon, but honestly, she still doesn't even know where her fricking heart lies. So, I mean, to pile on deadly girls, along with 2 guys who break her to bits.........sort of hard to figure out your life, ya know??Just two words:READ IT. :)
