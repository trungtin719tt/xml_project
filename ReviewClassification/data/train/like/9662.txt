The Elephant Tree was a very compelling book from start to end. It was fast-paced - I couldn't wait to see what happens next.Yet this book is different from all the thrillers I have read because it offers more than just adrenaline rush. The author keeps you intrigued through the various twists and turns.Despite the setting being the world of drug dealers and criminals, you can't help but sympathize with the characters. Scott and Angela were very likeable characters. I genuinely felt for them.Both of them were stuck in a world where they don't really belong.The Elephant Tree is a well-written and original novel with an engrossing plot. Moreover there is more depth to it , than might be apparent for the first time. Though this is one of those books which sucks you in right from the fist page, it also takes a step away from the usual whodunnits. Its hard to believe that this is the author's first novel.The ending was really unexpected and despite the huge amount of suspense novels I have read, it still managed to take me by surprise.Overall:Gripping psychological thriller!Recommended?Yes! To everyone who loves thrillers and suspense, with a depth.
