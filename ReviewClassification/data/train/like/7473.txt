Longfellow pays homage to and takes influence from Lovecraft, Shirley Jackson, Steven King, Hitchock, Houdini, and the Wendigo legend, but creates a distintly new and fresh modern psychological terror. The novel takes it shots at Hollywood and reveals the trials and tribulations of writers, and the horror that they suffer unto their own minds.I also found many similarities to the popular and polarizing work ofDanielewski's House of Leaves, although I'd guess unintentional. Those liking House of Leaves I feel are likely to love this, but this work also succeeds in every area House of Leaves drew complaints. In the end, you don't need Danielewski's if you can write like this.side note:while this is not of the young-adult genre, it does seem to be a good fit for young teens wishing to read some good horror that doesn't include vampires that sparkle.
