To see this review and others, please visitwww.readrantrockandroll.comA Monster Callsby Patrick Ness is a book like no other and one that I'll never forget.My first rating in January on this book was 4 stars. I couldn't figure out why, I just didn't love the story. I re-read it this past weekend and I've revised my review.*This review may contain spoilers for those who haven't read the book...I was very angry, then sad, then had mixed emotions in between. My main issue when I first read it was that I wanted more of an ending, or perhaps more before the ending. Maybe I wanted a different outcome because I was so hopeful for Conor. I don't know, but after reading it again, without a doubt, I know I just can't handle the truth. As a mom, my worst nightmare. With that said, I've pondered over it and feel this book deserves 5 stars.It's a book I'd still recommend to anyone and I'm very much looking forward to seeing the movie.The illustrations by Jim Kay make the book feel so real. This is a book I want to keep forever.5**** to one powerful story.Watched the movie and loved it, but not as much as the book...
