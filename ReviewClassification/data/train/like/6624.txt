True love means that you care for another's happiness more than your own, no matter how painful the choices you face might be.Sparks, I love this book, I love Savannah, John and Tim too.. I love you man..Dear John is an amazing book, It took me to another place, made me feel such beautiful, strange feelings I can't even describe, each word touched me alot, Savannah's and John's love touched me way more.I liked the way they were and the way the book was.Despite that the whole novel was talking about true love, and that we have to care about the people we love more than ourselves, but the ending was awful, I hated it, according to me it was the worst part of the book, he disappointed me.Anyway, it was really a beautiful book..Just READ IT.
