The Last Word Review:As the title suggests, this is the true story of what happened to the B-17 bomber 'Susan Ruth' and its crew. The difference is it is written by the Pilots Son so it is a very personal account.The crews of the B-17 bombers were some of the bravest, flying daylight missions over enemy territory, hitting important targets to deplete Germany's fighting capacity so many young men were lost flying deadly missions over Germany and occupied Europe.On February 8, 1944 Howard Snyder's B-17 was shot down over the France/Belgium border so here is the real story of 'Shot Down ' of what happened to the crew, this is no ordinary true story of Pilot Howard Snyder and the crew that was shot down while on a mission.Steve Snyder must be congratulated on the immense task in writing what is a truly an 'outstandingly detailed historical account' of what happened to his father.When you first open the book the author brings us some family history and then the incredible detailed account of what the crew and how they arrived in England and the training, also what went on behind the scenes with the crews of the B-17 Squadrons were they went during rare days off.This is not just an account of the crew, there is also the research that has gone into what it was like to fly a B-17 and the preparation of each mission and the detail of the aircraft is what makes this book such a vital historical piece of work.Then of course we must look at the bravery of each crew member and also the people on the ground who looked after those that made alive. Of the ten man crew some sadly died some were captured and taken prisoner and then there is Howard Snyder the Pilot of 'Susan Ruth' who evaded capture and was missing in action for seven months, this is what then happened.The story is emotional and packed with bravery and tragedy, the book is packed with photographs and letters from those involved. When you read the account of when the Bomber was hit and the crew had to bail out you become involved and share the sheer terror and confusion.Finally at the end of the War Howard Snyder pays tribute to those that sheltered him from being captured and how they put their own lived in danger by doing just that, knowing that if they were caught they would have been shot. Imagine if you can evading capture for seven months.This is truly an outstanding account and also an important account of what happened to the Crew and pays tribute to all those brave airmen that gave so much so that we could enjoy the freedom we take for granted today. If you enjoy reading military history, then this is one book you must add to your library. You will not be disappointed.Please visit Steve Snyder's website: stevesnyderauthor.com and further information can be obtained and there is articles and video interviews.HIGHLY RECOMMEDED.
