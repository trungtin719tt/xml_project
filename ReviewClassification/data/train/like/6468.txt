Despite its longtime popularity, I had never read this book. The audio CD by Peter Thomas is excellent. In this fantasy, 10-year old Winnie stumbles upon the secret of the Tucks' magic spring. Although the setting is the late 1800s, Natalie Babbit's writing pushes that part of the setting to the background, immersing us fully in the characters. The poetic elements of the writing, the beautiful descriptions of the natural settings, the imagery--it was all so rich I often reached for the book after getting out of the car so I could savor some of Babbitt's writing one more time. Her descriptions of the summer days of 10-year old Winnie took me back--that's how I remember summer. No Tucks, or men in yellow suits around, but idle moments along quiet roads and journeys down paths and into woods were revived in my memory. Maybe reading it at a later time in life made me more attuned to the Tucks dilemma. The way the author leads us through the plot to confront questions of morality and of existence is wonderful. Along the way, tension repeatedly rises and then frames a question, and the reader is drawn into Winnie's situation--what would we do? The elder Tuck's soliloquy, while taking Winnie out on the water to fully explain things, generates a level of compassion for the Tucks as if they were our own dearest relatives. Babbitt draws on timeless images: the changing of the seasons, like a wheel, circling around; the fleeting strains of a distant melody; the contrast of youthful exuberance and aging weariness, of joy and tragedy; the waters, flowing, always flowing--at least for some. This is a great book for young and old alike--timeless, like the Tucks.
