One doesn't just read Borges, one experiences Borges.The first book I read of his [The Book of Imaginary Beginnings] left me disappointed. I don't recommended reading that book first. I also thought he could of done a lot better with that book. With this book, I'm now a fan of Borges. I don't think he's the best short story writer I've come across (I'll get to that later), but I do think he knew what he is talking about and he can tell a story well.Borges is kind of known as the master of metafiction. This book is calledCollected Fictions, but let's use that term lightly. Some of these stories read like non-fictions. Some read short prose poems. This isn't your typical storytelling. Most of these stories will make you go to places you never been to before. Or maybe you'll travel to a time before you were born. Whatever it was, you don't need drugs are alcohol to experience Borges. Borges will take you anywhere you want and you can be whoever you want.You can compare his style to almost any author you have read. Why? Well he himself has read a ton of books and shows. However, he mentions Shakespeare, Dante, and1001 Nightsconstantly. I would recommended reading up on your classics before Borges. You don't really have too, but he kind of expects his reader to know what he is talking about some of the times. This short story collection isn't for readers who dislike old books or fancy writing styles. Borges loves the classics with passion. He kind of reads like a snob at times, but I totally get where he's coming from. He just wants you to read, understand, and love the books he loves.One author that I thought he was similar with, that I'm not sure others would compare, is H.P. Lovecraft. They both place you in this dreamlike/realistic world. You become the characters in these stories, you share their thoughts and feelings. However, Lovecraft makes you feel insane and unconformable as Borges makes you feel intellectual and safe. I actually prefer Lovecraft over Borges. Lovecraft wrote about New England (my home) where Borges mostly wrote about Argentina (somewhere foreign to me).Location and language is another factor that I feel like I have to bring up in this review. I feel like I can't fully understand everything Borges wrote in these stories. It helps to know about Argentina, it's history, and the Spanish language. I only speak English. This book is translated in English, but at times I feel like the translation is off. I feel like if I knew Spanish and read this in Spanish I would get more for these tales. Most translated books I don't feel like this, but this book is different. I think it's because Borges was a translator himself and langues, as these stories show, are important to him.This isn't a book I'd recommended to others unless I know exactly what you like. Yes you might read a lot, but I feel like you have to study the books you like to full get this. I honestly hate saying this, but this is one book I feel like having a degree in English/literature helps. Of course I'd probably never have read this book if it wasn't recommenced from one of my favorite professors in college. I can see why she would recommended this book.
