There's not much out there about Hypatia of Alexandria and what there is isn't world class. Kind of understandable considering what's left of her work and her life. But reading this "novel," got me as close to her as I ever expect to get. This is a wonderful book and though it might differ from the scanty research done by (perhaps) dubious scholars, I get the feeling that the rational and emotional jumps made by Longfellow are more Hypatia than any dry biased account could ever be. I'm also annoyed that anyone uses the Suda as a "source" for this extraordinary woman's life. The Suda was written a long time after Hypatia was killed and in a time whose conventions were nothing like Hypatia's - yet these conventions are applied to her. Celibacy for example. Celibacy in the Western World was a convenience urged by the Catholic Church for its own purposes, none of them laudable. Hypatia was no Christian and would never have been bound by the Christian dislike of the body and nature. Flow Down Like Silver also delves into the alchemical which was surely part of Hypatia's world just as mathematics was. Longfellow's clever assumptions based on common sense and a strong mystical understanding far surpasses the Suda. And then there's her superb storytelling and her delicious writing. Why don't libraries have this book?
