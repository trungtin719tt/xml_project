Frank E. Peretti's bookThis Present Darknessis brilliant. This is my second time reading this book, and I am even more impressed than the first time that I had read it, which was many years ago. As I read through it, I realized that I didn't remember large parts of the story and was so glad to have decided to read it again.The story centers around two principal characters, Hank Busche, a new pastor of a small church in a nondescript college town, and Marshall Hogan, recently transplanted publisher of the local newspaper. Points-of-view change not only among various earthly characters but also among both angelic and demonic beings.It is absolutely fascinating to get a glimpse of what the spiritual realm of our existence might be like! The overarching message of this story is the unequaled spiritual power of saints' prayers over the workings of evil. Peretti does a masterly job of storytelling, weaving multiple threads of experience, POV, plot, goals, schemes, attacks, counterattacks, and the spiritual awakening of mortal characters. As I finished reading, my only consolation in "leaving" the POV of angels is that I have the sequelPiercing the Darknesssitting next to me, which I will eagerly open up to read as soon as I have posted this review!
