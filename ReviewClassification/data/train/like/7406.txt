I will go out on a limb to say that second only to the major religious works (the Bible, the Koran, etc.), Nicolo Macchiavellie's "The Prince" is the most important and influential work that has ever been put into print. Composed by the Florentine in the 16th Century, "The Prince" provides the blueprint not just for the Renaissance ruler for whom it was allegedly penned, but also for anyone in politics, warfare, or even contemporary business. Machiavelli's premises may seem extreme to many (hence the adjectival "Machiavellian," meaning extremely censorius and penury), but his notions on alliances and leadership showcase a brilliant mind who paid attention not only to his contemporaries, but also to his ancestors to find the lessons (and the errors) made by countless generals and kings throughout Italian and European history."It is better to be feared than loved" is perhaps his most oft-quoted aphorism, but what of his warnings against arming lesser powers and of never trusting mercenaries (who can always be compromised by a higher bidder)? We need look only to the newspaper to find out that the current system--from the current Bush Administration and going back 50-some odd years--has fallen victim to Machiavelli's lessons again and again. One need only think of the blunders of the CIA, the Bay of Pigs, the Iran-Contra scandal, and yes, Iraq, to see that Machiavelli is as relevant today as he was half a millenium ago. The axiom states that we are doomed to repeat our own defective history should we not heed its lessons. If five centuries after "The Prince," governments and kingdoms have still learned nothing, then days darker than the Black Death may yet be ahead.This is one of the greatest works in print, of any time, of any place, in any language. Read it, learn it, live it!
