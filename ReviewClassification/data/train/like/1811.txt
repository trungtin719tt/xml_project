This collection of Edgar Allan Poe's short stories and poems is perhaps the most definitive that you are going to come across and it is the reason that I am satisfied with owning just this collection and nothing more. If I come across a nice looking Poe collection, I may consider purchasing it. I also own a collection of some of his short stories in an illustrated format, but I am from the mold that is satisfied with having one of a particular work in good quality. For what it is worth, this collection of Poe's works is completely satisfactory!This collection has all of his complete works (works like his very last, incomplete work, "The Light-House," are not included). Everything from his familiar tales like The Tell-Tale Heart and The Cask of Amontillado are included and also those that are not necessarily brought up in everyday discussion. All of his poems are included as well, from the familiar, such as The Raven and The Bells, to those from his younger days. One can be perfectly content with this collection alone as far as Edgar Allan Poe is concerned. This collection is also a really good buy, as many of his collections will have a selected amount of works and be worth more than this one.You can find Literary Gladiators discussions about Poe's works here:The Tell-Tale Heart (containing spoilers):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pDvU0...The Cask of Amontillado (containing spoilers):https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s_jfD...
