A book starts with a human arm giving the finger suspended from a flag pole. And it ain't the game of thrones. You know its gonna be good.Amazed. Tried to read this in my early 20's or late teens after Cuckoo's Nest and the now questionible "Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test."Wasn't ready for a book that truly captures the NATURE of coastal Oregon, let alone loggers in a grand Shakespearean manner.Really loved every second of this book this time. Kesey could have taken that LSD and run wild with it, yet I think it opened his mind so that he could really get into some characters, and really see the relationship between man and nature. So glad I had enough beers before seeing the movie I didn't remember a lick.Here's a sage review of the movie from IMDB...It is a great movie whether it was faithful to the book or not. Kesey was high on drugs when he wrote the book and from what I understand it is obvious to the reader. 600 pages of weirdness. If people like that then that is fine for them. That doesn't diminish the straightforward message of this movie.Sorry fella, no weirdness here.
