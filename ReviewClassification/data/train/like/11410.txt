On a recent trip back to the UK, I was lucky enough to meet the author R. D. Ronald doing a book signing in Newcastle. In all honesty I hadn't heard of Richard or his books, but he spoke with such conviction and passion about his work and why he writes, I bought both his titles, The Zombie Room and The Elephant Tree and I have to say I was not disappointed! In fact I read The Zombie Room on the flight back to the US becasue I couldn't put it down. The Zombie Room is an excellent, well written book that really encompassed the passion that the author expressed when we spoke. I would urge you to read this book and if you get a chance, chat to the author on Facebook. Brilliant - and I am looking forward to his future work as I am now a definite fan!!
