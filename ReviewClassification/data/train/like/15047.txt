I was given this book by my husband because I was feeling a bit overwelmed by a number of large fantasy reads I had on my TBR file. I had just read a number of "smaller" works and really enjoyed them.I was instantly captivated by this book. The begining is one of the most creative starts I've seen in a long time. I loved the humor of Bartimaeus and immediately got an impression of the character and I loved is Bravado.I found the footnotes entertaining - I know some people have been crtical of them but I found them very entertaining and while distracting I was always glad they were there.The young wizard - I thought was not as well defined as the demon - oh sorry djinni. Also I didn't think the supporting cast was very well developed (i.e his master and his wife etc). Even so I found the plot well constructed and the pace good and all in all it was a very enjoyable read.I read this in just a few days a good indication to me that it was well written with a good plot and characters. I highly recommnd this book especially to those who enjoy fantasy novels.
