It's hard to really write a description of this book. Yes, there is plot and structure and story, but the book isn't really about that. It is a book about love and grief and hope and despair. It's about fathers love for their children, despite their choices, about love for one's country and homeland, even when its structure is not ideal or right. It's about how wrong and right choices both effect not only ourselves but those around us with far-reaching ripples. It's about poetry and beauty even in the ugliest of ashes. It's about change and those who have the heart to work for change, but also about tradition and those who cling to the good things that should remain.Paton wrote in a kind of back and forth prose and poetry which flowed so beautifully together that while I noticed the switch from one to the other, they formed such a cohesive whole that it just felt natural. It's a juxtaposition of the harshness of desolate land and when people are ugly to one another, with the beatify of a restored land and the soulful beauty of what happens when people choose to reach out. It may be set in South Africa, but the themes of inequality, differences and similarities between people of different cultures, urban vs. rural and the clash of the old and the young are timeless. Well worth the read.4.5/5
