It's not difficult to see why this beautiful book has won numerous awards. After reading a few friends' reviews for this book I simply knew I had to read it and I'm so glad I did.This is a heartwarming tale of a young girl named Opal who lives with her father. Growing up without her mother has not been easy for Opal and she's been feeling a sense of loneliness through her childhood. But that's all about to change the day she comes across a dog who appears just as lost and lonely as Opal does. Opal names the dog Winn-Dixie and quickly the pair become inseparable.A beautifully written story of friendship, love and loss. A fabulous children's book to be read and savoured for all ages. Highly recommended.
