Initially i gave this book 4 stars, but last night it got me thinking and a book that makes me think and prevents me to sleep deserves a 5 star in my book.This is the story of Santiago Nasar's murder. This literally is a story of an Appointment with Death. Despite almost everybody in the village knowing that Santiago is going to be killed, whether through ignorance, superstition, lies or malice (lets face it Santiago isn't a very nice guy) his death could not be prevented.
