It's 1am, just finished this and it was aMAZEing, see what I did there ;)Review to come!!Review (more like gush):Where do I even start this review...Okay, so, The Maze Runner is absolutely incredible! I loved it so much!This book instantly sucked me in, when I really just got it off my shelf to look at it! Haha, I had always been a bit hesitant to read this book, because I didn't think I'd like it much... Boy, was I wrong. I even broke a book-lover rule and saw the movie first, because I was never actually sure if I'd read this! Yet, I still enjoyed the book so much, even though I knew what was going to happen! (Makes me so excited for book 2, because I don't know what's gonna happen)Reading this made me feel like it was Christmas morning, all jittery and happy. It gave me nostalgic feels even though I'd never read it before... maybe I felt a bit like I did while reading the hunger games... Idk, it's hard to place.This book caused me severe lack of sleep, not even just by reading late into the night, but also because when I wasn't reading, I was thinking or dreaming about this book! I even read it at every break I got on my biology excursion! I've never said 'just one more chapter' more in my entire reading life! Which I think is fair to say I'm pretty obsessed with it!I'm SO happy that I loved this book the way I did, because it's been soo long since I've completely and utterly enjoyed a book!Go read this if you haven't already!Might go read Scorch Trials now... See ya Goodreads people &lt;3
