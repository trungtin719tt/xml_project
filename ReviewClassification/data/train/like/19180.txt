Even if I weren't already in love with this writer, who could resist this cover? I'm told that to be a success in the arts an artist has to make the same thing over and over. Longfellow makes a different thing each time. I read somewhere this was her first published book and she was trying to write the usual best seller. It's not the usual anything. It's smart and sassy and sad. The poor little rich girl messing with other people's lives in a rip roaring San Francisco of the 1920s. I have to say, I have other favorite authors, but not one of them can change gears like this writer can and keep her readers.
