January 2018 Re-read. Buddy read with SarahJanuary 2017 Re-read: Buddy read with SarahDecember 2015 re-read: Buddy read withSarahStill a really excellent entry in this series - I think thatHunting Groundor maybeFair Gameare my favorites of the A&amp;O series, but I LOVE seeing the growth of Anna, specifically, in this book. Her character-arc is absolutely fantastic. She's still figuring out here way, not only in her very new relationship with Charles, or moving across country, or joining a new pack, but learning what it is to actuallybePack, tobea werewolf, and toBEand Omega. It's not easy because Omegas are pretty rare (in the entire series, I've only heard of one other - who is also new), and one of the only sources that knows a great deal about them, is fairly traumatized and reluctant to really speak of it. Nonetheless, Anna flourishes. She learns, through trial and error, following instinct. She listens to herself and thinks things through. And she is a steady presence for everyone around her. I love that her mating with Charles has to wait for their human parts to catch up to what their wolves have already decided. I like that - especially with her past abuse - it'snotinstantaneous. I love that she's still healing (even beyond this book, actually), and that there's no rush from the people surrounding her. They love and accept her. Period.That's a big block of love for Anna. She deserves it. Charles does, too. He's not one that has a bold sense of humor, it's subtle and sneaks up on you, but it makes me truly grin. I'm so utterly happy with his bafflement, with the way (as Asil says) Anna leads him on a merry chase. I love how he's protective, and considers a rogue he's barely met,his. I love how he consistently builds Anna up, never discounting her or her contributions, always thankful for her in his life, in that moment, no matter what. I love that he speaks honestly to her, all the time, no matter how hard the truth may be. I love that he apologizes when he's been an ass (not even that big of an ass, really, but he did hurt her feelings). I love that it's not just an 'I'm sorry,' but an actual 'I was wrong.'I mentioned Asil in my original review, but I don't think that my love for him has ever been stronger than it is here. I hurt for him, and I hope that we get a lot more of him in the future (is it wrong that I'd love to see a spin-off story/novella/book with him as the lead? Past, present, or future...doesn't matter). And Bran. What can I possibly say about Bran. We learn so much more about him here. He seems so non-threatening that I think it's sometimes easy to forget exactly how powerful he is. In this book we learn a LOT more about him, and his history - in a very painful way.I just love this entire series. From the strong characters, the amazingly sweet romance, and the awesome world...it's got everything I could ask for.Original Review:It's hard to review a book in a series that's become a favorite. Even while re-reading this book I couldn't help but think of the overall series, and world. Implications, and realities that are learned.The first 1/3 is definitely slower than I'm used to in PB books, I think that's partly due to the fact of the beginning really starting in Alpha &amp; Omega (the novella). I really enjoyed some of the conversations that took place there, and I like the way that Charles and Anna's relationship develop. They have a very different dynamic than Mercy and Adam, for example. Anna is a bit gun-shy (and watching her come out of that is one of the most satisfying things I've read) to start, and Charles is very unused to communicating his feelings.Anna begins to learn to read Charles, listening to more than just his words including his body language, tone, and even her nose. Charles learns who Anna is, not someone that he has to coddle and protect, but someone strong-willed enough to enjoy all he has to offer.This is an incredibly emotional book, more so on re-reads for me. The parts with Walter nearly always break my heart and choke me up. Asil too. And, of course, being obsessed with Bran, I love learning more about him. And we do get quite a bit more insight since the book takes place in Aspen Creek.Cry Wolf is an eminently satisfying read with a strong romance and plenty of outside drama.
