This sequel was just as good as the first one "Anne of Green Gables". It was nice, comfortable, endearing and at times hilarious. In this book, we get to follow Anne as she grows up to become a woman, and the new set of characters (as well as the well-known ones from the first book) are great. Montgomery has managed to create a world which can only bring a smile to your face, and so I'm obviously excited to get back to it whenever I decide to pick up the third book.
