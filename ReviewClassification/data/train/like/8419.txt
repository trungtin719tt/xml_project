I hate myself a little.Instead of getting worse, I'm finding that this series is getting better. I don't know if it's because the writing is getting better, or it's because I'm just getting used to it. But, despite my better judgement, I actually liked this book better than its predecessors.The drama was way more engaging, the characters more interesting. I feel like more things were explained, &amp; things are starting to take shape.Personally, my favorite part is that Zoey, the main character, messes up completely while in a love triangle... Well it's more of a square... Anyway. She messes up, &amp; she realizes that she's gullible &amp; a bit stupid. Finally. A dumb character who admits to it.I'm onto the fourth one, I suppose. I hope this high note wasn't a fluke.
