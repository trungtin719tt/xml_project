I love this series. I have never felt so connected to a set of characters. Whenever I'm reading one of these books I always feel like I'm right there and that zoey and her gang are my friends. These books bring me happiness, sadness, anger, serenity, &amp; laughter. I always regret finishing one and always enjoy picking up another. I am ecstatic to hear that there are more books to come and even more ecstatic to hear that they are working on making them into films. I say keep up the good work P.C. Cast. Keepthe books coming and bring on the movies!!
