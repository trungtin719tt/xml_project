"If she was mine, I'd cherish every inch of her. And I wanted to. Now."HOLY ALIEN HOTNESS.After hearing nothing but positive things about this series, I thought it was about time I'd give it a try myself to find out what all the hype was about and WOW... I'm SO GLAD I finally started it!!! There was never a dull moment in this first part of the series and once I got into the story, I ended up devouring it! I'm pretty sure this will quickly become my new favorite YA series once I continue with the rest of it!!! Although it's considered to be YA, I felt it had a much more mature feeling to it. I loved the characters, the original storyline and the engaging writing style and well,Daemon Black is one hot alien you just HAVE to meet...THE STORYStarting over is never easy...After Katy's father passed away, her mother decides it's best for them to leave the house they used to live in and move some place new. They leave Florida and decide to start over in a small town in West Virginia. Moving into a new town and enrolling in a new school for her senior year, isn't easy... But what's worse is having a new neighbor who isn't very welcoming to her at all."I thought people in small towns were supposed to be nice, not act like the son of Satan."While struggling to find her place in this strangely populated town, Katy also has to find a way to cope her handsome but extremely arrogant neighborDaemon Black. Although Katy quickly becomes friends with Daemon's sister Dee, Daemon keeps treating her like she doesn't belong is this town, which makes her feel like something is off about him... And then she discovers the neighbors next door are nothing she could have ever expected; they're aliens.KATY SWARTZ"The day my internet was hooked up was better than having a hot guy check our my butt and ask for my phone number."I really loved Katy's personality. She's down to earth, funny, sarcastic and full of witty remarks. Plus, she's also a book nerd which made her all the more easy to relate with. I loved that the story was written in her point of view, because being inside her head wasneverboring. She's a strong character and I admired that she stood up for herself so well. Especially against someone like Daemon...DAEMON BLACK"Beautiful face. Beautiful body. Horrible attitude. It was the holy trinity of hot boys."Yes, Daemon is HOT as hell BUT at the same time he's also infuriatingly annoying. At first I didn't know whether to love him or hate him...And neither did Katy! Daemon constantly switches his attitude from hot to cold and back again. Most of the time, he treats her like his number one enemy and he even tries to keep her away from his sister, in fear of them becoming to close."To Daemon, my arrival was the beginning of the end. The apocalypse. Kat-mageddon."Most of the time Katy and Daemon don't get along AT ALL. But since, Katy has become best friends with Daemon's twin sister Dee (who's character I absolutely loved btw!), they are forced to spent some time together. Whenever they do meet though, Daemon manages to infuriate the hell out of Katy."I'd always avoided confrontation in the past, but this guy was flipping my bitch switch like nothing else."I loved the playful banter between the two of them. It kept the story interesting and refreshing and it provided some hilarious and highly entertaining moments..."You're such an ass. Has anyone ever told you that?"He flashed a genuinly amused smile. "Oh, Kitten, every single day of my blessed life."And even though they're constantly arguing, they also share a few intimate moments where Daemon shows the "real" him and he becomes a much nicer version of himself.Daemon tries to keep his distance from Katy, but because he's had to save her life a few times, she carries a glow of energy around her that the Arum, the Luxen's greatest enemy, can detect. Therefore, Daemon is "forced" to spend time with Katy and protect her from potential attacks until the effect from his alien mojo has faded away. Whenever they're around each other, there's a tension in the air and it's obvious they're attracted to each other..."Holy Hawt Chemistry, Batman!"And when they *finally* kiss, the chemistry is off the charts!!!The entire story is written in Katy's POV but at the end of the book we also get a few chapters from Daemon's POV and for that I am VERY grateful. They really show that despite his cockiness, he actually had a good reason for acting the way he did.So, Daemon, despite some of your more "jerkish" moves...Luckily, this first part of the series does not end with a cliffhanger, but the ending still makes me want to read the next part of the series very soon!!!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to anyone who enjoys YA paranormal stories!!!~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~"I won't hurt you, Kat." His tone was softer, but still laced with fury as he tried to control me without doing any real damage. "I could never hurt you."4.5 STARS.
