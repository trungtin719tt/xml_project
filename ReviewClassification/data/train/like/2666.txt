There are already thousands of reviews for this deeply moving and heartbreaking book here on Goodreads, and I don't know that I could add anything new. It simply broke my heart. However I do feel really strongly that I should describe the vivid imagery that I'm left with.Bright red poppies in bloodied fieldsWhere death stalked its victims.It cared not for age, creed, or nationalityWhat would they have achieved in life,These young men, with so much yet to experience,So many dreams to fulfilIf duty hadn't called, and they hadn't answeredWhen the sun set for one final timeIt set on the lives they never lived
