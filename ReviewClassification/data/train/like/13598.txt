Very entertaining sequel toThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy. In this book, our heroes...I don't really know how to even begin to summarize the plot. Our heroes are on a quest to get something to eat which leads to adventures through time and space and parallel dimensions and a trip to visit the man who runs the universe. I have always thought that the Hitchhiker books get progressively weirder and weirder. Bear in mind that the first book features pan-dimensional superintelligent mice, so that's saying something. If you thought that the first book was too random and disorganized for your taste you're probably not going to love the sequels.Having just read this for the third time I do not count myself in that group, and this is my second favorite of the fiveHitchhikerbooks. The humor is a little more uneven than in book one which is the only thing keeping this from five stars for me. But when the book is "on" it is more fun than a Pan-Galactic Gargle Blaster. If you thoughtThe Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxywas funny I highly recommend this book.4 stars.Reread in January, 2004 and April, 2012.
