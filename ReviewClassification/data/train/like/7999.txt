A masterpiece.Newland Archer, a young lawyer, is engaged to be married to May Welland, a sweet but (he soon comes to realize) rather limited girl. Their two families are prominent ones in 1870s Manhattan so everything is as it should be. And then Archer meets Countess Ellen Olenska, a childhood sweetheart and May's cousin, who is back in NYC after fleeing a disastrous marriage in Europe. She is unconventional, beautiful, and shares Newland's interest in art and books. Can you guess what happens?Wharton knows everything about this Gilded Age world. The prose is subtle and elegant yet so sharply observed; the central characters live and breathe and have a feeling of mystery; the sense of place is vivid; the plotting and structure are tight.And although it's set 150 years ago, the situations are universal. When the smitten Newland sees Ellen after a long time he exclaims: "Each time you happen to me all over again," which gave me shivers because it sounds so contemporary.The final chapter, in particular, is a model of economy: decades flash by showing changing mores, and a poignant sense of regret and acceptance suffuses everything. I was sobbing during the final pages.It took me a while to get used to all the secondary characters and their foibles. And of course not all of that era's NYC population is represented. But there are fascinating insights into class and hierarchy and the role of women in this unique world.The Age Of Innocenceis must reading, especially if you're engaged to be married. I will definitely revisit it and read Wharton's other novels.
