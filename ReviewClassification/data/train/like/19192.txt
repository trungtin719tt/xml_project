A wonderfully written romp through the San Francisco of 1923, after a great opener during the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. If you've ever hungered to wander through the real Chinatown of tongs and opium dens, or to know what goes on in those big houses on Nob Hill, this is your book. It's a humdinger and I loved every sassy word of it.
