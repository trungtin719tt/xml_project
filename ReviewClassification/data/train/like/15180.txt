All Together Dead4 StarsSookie accompanies Sophie Ann, the Queen of Louisiana, and her entourage to the Vampire Summit in Illinois. There she must contend not only with the political machinations of the various vampire factions, and the murder of the Arkansas contingent, but also a possible terror attack that may wipe out everyone she knows.The mystery in this installment is one of the more predictable and could have been resolved more easily if Sookie didn't have the terrible tendency toward forgetting important details that later come back to haunt her. How can someone be so willfully blind?Sookie's problems with the men in her life continue: Jason makes a commitment that may have disastrous consequences for his sister. Circumstances lead Eric to forge an even tighter bond with Sookie than before, and Quinn's actions force her to rethink their relationship. At least Bill's betrayal has put the kibosh on that romance, and Calvin and Alcide have apparently realized their unsuitability.Aside from all this, there are some compelling developments. In a surprising heart-to-heart, Pam reveals her past with Eric and it is a doozy! The vampire world is shaken to the core with the unforeseen deaths of several characters and Sookie rethinks her future with the supernaturals in her life.All in all, an action packed addition to the series, and the twists and turns should make for interesting reading in the future.
