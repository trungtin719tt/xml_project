With 'And the Mountains Echoed' I have read all three of Khaled Hosseini's books. I am not going to talk about the plot, story, characters of this book but I do want to say that I feel the reason why Khaled Hosseini is such a good writer is because of his writing style....it is simple yet effective. He does not use difficult phrases or long complicated words to describe people and situations in his book; he keeps his wording simple and this creates the desired effect in terms of emotions and feelings. He talks about his home country with complete honesty and without any excuses....he describes the good and the bad for what it is.
