Now as much as Frances Hodgson Burnett'sA Little Princessis and remains both a childhood and adulthood favourite, in some if not actually many ways, Sara Crewe and her entire demeanour do at times appear as being simply and frustratingly just a bit too good to be true. And while I have indeed always liked Sara's story tremendously, I also must admit that I have never loved it as much as, say,The Secret Garden(also, of course, by Frances Hodgson Burnett) or the Anne of Green Gables and the Emily of New Moon series (Lucy Maud Montgomery). For in all of these here novels, the main characters are presented as having their share of faults (and at times even seriously problematic and major ones), while inA Little Princess, Sara Crewe seemingly has little or no such peccadilloes (except perhaps that she does at times appear almost patronising in her goodness and her feelings forthe populace, but I think that the author, that Frances Hodgson Burnett actually does not mean this to be considered as a fault, and it is just our more modern sensibilities which tend to make us consider this kind ofnoblesse obligefeeling to be not entirely, not altogether praiseworthy anymore).And actually, one important consideration to keep in mind is thatA Little Princesswas published quite a few years beforeThe Secret Garden(the fomer was published in 1905, I believe, and I thinkThe Secret Gardenwas not published until 1911 or so, and the novella on whichA Little Princessis based,Sara Crewe, Or What Happened At Miss Minchin'swas actually published even earlier, around 1888). And thus, perhaps Frances Hodgson Burnett's attitude towards children had matured by the time she pennedThe Secret Garden, and she might have by then realised that it would be better to have main characters who are not perfect, but also have their share of not so stellar character traits. But on the other hand, I also have to wonder whether the author might not have deliberately portrayed Sara as a faultless princess-like character because she wanted to portray her as some kind of magical, fairy tale like entity (a child-goddess of compassion, helpful, patient, accepting, but ultimately too good to be true, a bit like the type of character Dickon represents inThe Secret Garden, similarly godlike and unrealistic, but then, Dickon is a supporting character and not the main character, like Sara is inA Little Princess).Still,A Little Princesstruly is and always will be a lovely and sweet tale (somewhat of an upside down fairy tale, a riches to rags and then back to riches story) and a novel that although written more than a century ago, is still enjoyable, readable and for most children, approachable (and I bet for many adults are like me, having not just fond childhood memories ofA little Princess, but also of repeated rereads).
