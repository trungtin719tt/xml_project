Flowers for Algernonis a wonderful book about how raw intelligence can be both a gift and a curse. The protagonist, Charlie Gordon, has his IQ increased via a surgical procedure from that of a barely functional mentally retarded person to superhuman intelligence and writes the book in first person based on his experience. The procedure was first tried on lab mouse Algernon who the protagonist befriends and who is a litmus test of what he experiences. The maturity of the writing improves as he becomes smarter and smarter. However, (spoiler alert but then why would anyone read a book that left the story there?), things are not all rosy and Algernon has a sudden precipitous drop in IQ and dies in considerable confusion and pain. Now, can Charlie discover a cure and maintain the enhanced smarts? Does he want to? Is he condemned to go full circle and lose all his self-awareness? These questions are tackled throughout the book and make for great reading. This theme has since been addressed in sci fi (I read "Understand" by Ted Chiang this week on the same idea), but Keyes' treatment of it is both moving and insightful and a great read.Nota bene: At WebSummit in Lisbon this week, Bryan Johnson spoke of his new venture (after the $1B sale of Braintree to PayPal some years back) about bringing this kind of cognitive enhancement into the real world, but based on Charlie's experience, this terrorized rather than excited me. How do you feel about this inevitable new field of neuroscience? Let me know in the comments.
