How do I begin to explain the awesomeness that is this series...?Percy Jackson is flawless.It has two Celestial bronze daggers and a sliver chariot.I hear its pages are insured for $10,000.I hear it does Diet Coke commercials in Greece.Its favorite movie is Disney's Hercules.One time, it met JK Rowling on a plane and she told it it was the next Harry Potter.One time, it punched me in the feels... It was awesome!
