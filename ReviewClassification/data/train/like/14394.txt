Interestingly, I did not like the ending of this book as a teen, but I found it very moving as an adult. It reminds me of the ending of Montgomery's Rilla of Ingleside. Not very many authors risk stopping a story on the up side of a climax, but Marshall employs the technique beautifully here. She left me with an appetite for more rather than filling my tummy with a glut of resolutions, and I'm old enough now to realize that the former is sometimes much more satisfying than the latter. Here's to maturity!
