My reading this morning of The Velveteen Rabbit was a lovely stroke of serendipity. Having read a review for aWilliamFaulkner title I decided to check my library catalogue to see if it was available. It wasn't. Oddly not even one Faulkner but right there in the search results was The Velveteen Rabbit by MargeryWilliamsand illustrated byWilliamNicholson. I hadn't read it but most certainly had heard of it so figured why not?This charming little story is one I'll definitely bring out if ever I'm fortunate enough to become a grandmother. When my daughter was young we read together for hours on end. Beautiful hours spent lost in storyland and I wish I'd known of this book then. The magic would have washed over us and I can picture so clearly the way her big brown eyes would have sparkled with the possibility of one of her cherished toys being brought to life.It's a very short story which tells of a soft toy in the shape of a rabbit. Gifted to a young boy for Christmas, left in the nursery with all his other toys, gradually progressed to cherished possession - a real rabbit in the eyes of the boy. After some time the toy was tossed away and replaced by a newer toy but with a little magic and good fortune the Velveteen Rabbit is brought to life.Ultimately I may or may not find the Faulkner but am delighted I found the Velveteen Rabbit.
