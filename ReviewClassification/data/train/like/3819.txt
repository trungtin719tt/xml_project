Actual Rating: 4.5 - rounded up for overall enjoyment level.Well, my emotions are all over the place and I don't think I'll ever be able to write a coherent review for this book because this series man. Don't knock it till you try it and I was one of those naysayers in the beginning that looked at the title and thought "lolnope" and then the movie looked interesting so I tried the first book out. I really lovelove Rose as a main character. Some people find her annoying, I get that, but her voice is one of the most unique and distinctive in YA. Took me two years to finish this series, and while I had long droughts of not reading it, I was always happy to get back into the world and now I'm done and what the hell. I just loved all the character development in this series and with a series this long, that is always what I look for.I might eventually read Bloodlines because I know people will ask. It's not high on my tbr but eventually I will. When all the dust settles and I'm emotionally able to move on from this ending.
