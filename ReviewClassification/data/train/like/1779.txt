I see more in this book each time I read it. Class distinctions, friendships, character development, sin, repentance, forgiveness, redemption--all are explored and charted in this thirteenth novel of Dickens.My favorite characters are Joe Gargery, the gentle and loving blacksmith; the faithful Herbert Pocket; and the helpful Mr. Wemmick and his Aged P.I've been seeing a recurring theme in several of Dickens' novels--a degrading reliance on hopes of the future to the detriment of the duties and joys of the present. Whether they are waiting for something to turn up (Mr. Micawber), for the settling of a lawsuit (Richard Carstone), for a son to join the family business (Paul Dombey), for the dignities that come with freedom (William Dorrit), or for the unfolding of the plans of a benefactor (Pip), certain key characters are addicted to gambling just as surely as is Little Nell's grandfather.Ready for a coffee break? Here is a reading from near the end of the book. There are spoilers, of course.http://www.cartenoire.co.uk/great-exp...
