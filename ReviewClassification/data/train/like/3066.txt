I think there are going to be a lot of middle-grade readers that end up being a hot mess and their heart ripped out after reading this one. Oh wait, maybe I just described myself. A wonderful, coming of age story that I truly enjoyed. Who would have thought running dogs and catching raccoons could be so intense and exciting? So much to this story and one that I highly recommend. Grab the Kleenex and brace yourself. Loved it!
