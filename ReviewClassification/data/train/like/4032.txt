The whole day, I have been trying to find the best words to use in this review, but how can you find the right words to describe perfection? This book was just a delight to read, from start to finish. The fact that a single man was able to create a fictional world with so much detail absolutely blows my mind. You can feel the love Tolkien had for Middle-earth in every word he writes. The way everything comes together makes it hard to believe that all of this is truly just fictional. There is so much information loaded in these few hundred pages; I already know that I will reread this book many, many times throughout the rest of my life, just so that I might be able tosome dayunderstand and remember everything.As wonderful and dear as this book is to me, I also want to say that:1. You probably shouldn't read this before readingThe HobbitorThe Lord of the Rings. I think it would be too confusing and just a bittoo muchas a starter to this world.2. You also probably shouldn't read this if you didn't like either of the aforementioned books. You need to care for Middle-earth and its history to properly enjoy and appreciate this one.3. If you did enjoy the aforementioned books, doNOTgo into this one thinking that you're going to get a similar adventurous story. This isn't exactly what I would describe as a "novel". The description it probably fits the best is "bible of a fictitious world".
