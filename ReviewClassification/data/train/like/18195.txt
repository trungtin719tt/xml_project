I needed something to read on the plane from San Antonio so I picked this book up at an airport bookstore. It was a good choice because I have been interested in dystopian literature for some time.I found Brave New World both prescient and engaging. I thought Huxley did a good job not only describing his view of the future, but also supplying a decent plot and good character development. The interplay between the rebellious intellectual Bernard Marx, the beautiful and shallow, fully acclimated Lenina Crowne, and the "Savage" John from New Mexico was interesting. I also appreciated the contrast between hyper-modern London and the Indian reservation in New Mexico, where old traditions persisted. Huxley described the setting in both places convincingly, although they represented opposite extremes of human behavior.I do see some signs that Huxley's depressing vision of the future has been realized. For example, the stratification of society according to cognitive skills is very evident today. One might even suggest that today's surveillance state and military-industrial complex leave little room for individuality. A powerful media is capable of transmitting government propaganda. Our popular culture is extremely low-brow and decadent. Perhaps it is difficult to have authentic, unmediated experiences and shape one's own destiny. Those who try to live off the grid in order to escape the confining norms and conventions of a post-industrial society may relate to Huxley's dystopian vision.
