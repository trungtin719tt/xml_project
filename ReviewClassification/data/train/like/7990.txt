I was such a douchebag about this book before it was released.Then I saw it there in the bookstore and I was like, "Did you or did you not likeThe Da Vinci Code?" (Answer: yes.) "Do you or do you not enjoyotherbooks that are pop culture phenomenons?" (Answer: yes.) "Is the ratio of Fitzgerald to comic books on your bookshelf not 1:50?" (Answer: yes.) "Did you or did you not just finish a book calledCaptain Underpants?" (Answer: yes.) "Furthermore, asshole, do you or do you not read fan fiction?" (Answer: yes.) "So, seriously, either get yourself some fucking hipster jeans and stop listening to Top 40 radio, or pick up the goddamn book and give it a chance. Geez, hasTwilightreally made you such a prick?" (Answer: apparently, yes.)Whatevs. The point is: this is standard Dan Brown, and I like it. It makes my palms sweat. It makes my heart beat fast. It creeps me out.Furthermore, I own BOTHNational Treasuremovies.There. That feels better.
