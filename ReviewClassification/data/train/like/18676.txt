"Nero fiddled while Rome Burned"-Quo Vadisbuilds on one of the more horrifying rumours of the tale behind this famous expression, in this story of love and faith in Nero's Rome. More horrifying are his descriptions of the gladiator games and "punishments" that Nero devised which are perhaps closer to the truth- and many shades worse than their modern interpretation in Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games. But amidst the excesses and horrors of life in Rome, there is also faith and love that brings to Lygia and Vinicius happiness at last but to most others the strength to face even the worst. But because this was a story of faith, I think, Lygia and Vinicius end up having to face far more adversity than well, they would have ordinarily (in a more "storybook" story that is). [And now my review has ended up sounding very different from what I'd intended!]
