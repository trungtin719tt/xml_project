Why is it that I always struggle to write a "review" for the books I love the most?I fell in love with Lonesome Dove. Hard. I know this is a book I will revist many times in the future. Hell, it's the kind of books that make me want to have children just so I can read it to them!It is magnificent, it is heartbreaking, uplifting, funny, inspirational, cruel. While telling a simple story and being surprisingly easy and fast to read, it is also profound and emotionally exhausting.Lonesome Dove is all that and so much more.It is honestly one of the greatest books I've read in my life. Maybe THE greatest.Never before have I encountered characters that felt so real and so alive. I became so attached to them (all of them, but especially Augustus McCrae and Clara) I shared their joys and pains, I felt like I was on the trail to Montana with them the whole time.I'm terrible at writing synopsis so I won't even try and, in a way, the less you know what the book is about, the greater the experience of discovering it.But let me just tell you, if you look in the dictionary for a definition of the word "Adventure" I believe Lonesome Dove is written there.And if you think this book isn't for you because it's a Western, or if you're too intimidated by its size... please, PLEASE, don't let that stop you. You'd be missing out on possibly the best reading experience ever.
