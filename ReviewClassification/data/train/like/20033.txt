Holy crap, what can I say about this amazing novel? I'm in a bit of a dry spell, reviewing-wise, at the moment but I seriously think words would have failed me when trying to express how I feel about this book even at my most verbose.I loved both of Khaled Hosseini's previous novels (The Kite RunnerandA Thousand Splendid Suns) but this one was even better. It touched me in my heart's most painful place and yet gave me hope for the future. There were tears. There was joy. There were tears again.The novel was so skilfully wrought. The connections between characters and events resonated with a subtle, graceful power most authors couldn't hope to achieve.I loved this book. My only complaint is that I wanted it to be twice as long. I await Hosseini's next novel like a slavering beast, chained to the wall of impatience.
