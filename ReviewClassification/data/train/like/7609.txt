A poignant account of a town and its people in exile and separation due to the outbreak of the plague. An emotionally trying, but highly satisfying read! It left me breathless at times, following some incredible yet modest heroes, and showing people dealing in different (ir)rational ways with a disease that defies all reason and understanding.
