As literature,Nauseais a remarkable character study and exploration of the ideas of existentialism. Sartre is a talented writer, capable of some truly striking prose, and the novel succeeds at drawing the reader deep into the mind of Roquentin in a manner that is intimate and engaging.But I can't say that I find these ideas as a basis for thought all that compelling. Sartre seems to have seized upon a common yet admittedly powerful experience - that peculiar sensation of sudden strangeness which can impose itself on otherwise familiar objects and concepts, accompanied by the simple striking fact of existence without explanation - and imbued this experiential phenomenon itself with a special profundity, from which he has extrapolated an entire philosophy.There is a logical failure in privileging such experiences due to their ephemeral yet strikingly salient quality, as being somehow representative of a deeper truth than can be obtained through ordinary rational thought. Such a thing would necessitate the existence of a sort of mind/brain dualism, where the mind thorough some undefined (and undemonstrated) metaphysical ability may occasionally transcend itself, and be allowed to glimpse the hidden nature of reality. I compare this kind of thinking to the practitioner of transcendental meditation, or the avid taker of psychedelics, who has experienced a profound oneness with everything, and is therefore convinced that all things in the universe must in fact share a single consciousness.The fact is that the brain is a strange and complex organ, prone to weirdness, and possessing a propensity for illusion and occasional quirky states of mind. Often these experiences can be generated deliberately through certain practices or through the use of pharmaceuticals. And so while such phenomena can offer valuable new perspectives, any revelations are necessarily limited to the nature of experience itself; they cannot break through the barrier of the mind to expose hidden knowledge about external reality.The attitude, then, of the Existentialist (in this case Roquentin), becomes increasingly myopic as this special information is granted primacy at the expense of other equally (and arguably more) valid experiential data. His mind obsessively explores the repercussions of this extrapolation from the single, logically unsound point, and it is clear to the reader that this view of reality is simply not tenable with respect to ordinary experience. I personally cannot claim any great familiarity with existentialism in the wider sense, but the ideas presented inNausea, aside from offering some interesting fodder for contemplation, seem too abstract and dissociated from reality to form the basis of a particularly robust or productive philosophical system.
