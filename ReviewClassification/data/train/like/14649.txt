My 3rd Nabokov and this sustains my belief that he was really one of the great storytellers that ever walked on earth.This postmodern novel is an example of meta-fiction. Because of this, it is a difficult read. I had to slow down and oftentimes went back at the start of the paragraph only to understand, even how shallow, what Nabokov is saying. In the end, however, finishing this book especially because I tried to really understand it, gave me a feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment. Nobody can argue about Nabokov's gift as storyteller so every time anyone finishes a book by him, one gets a bragging right. His books may be hard to understand but you gain so much that you feel like a different person, a more matured reader to be specific.I don't know about you, but for me, this book is one-of-its-kind. Who would have thought of having 2 personas to tell a story in different formats?John Shadewrote a 999-line poem entitledPale Fireand when he dies, his friendDr. Charles Kinbotemanages its publication and puts his annotations on it. Then the annotations end up telling his own story springing out from the times he shared with his friend, and his family - wifeSybiland daughterHazelwho committed suicide and the story is told in the second canto (the poem is divided into 4 cantos).The poem is excellent and it has quite a number of brilliant quotable lines. My favorite part is these lines addressed to his wife of 40 years, Sybil:We have been married forty years. At leastFour thousand times your pillow has been creasedBy our two heads. Four hundred thousand timesThe tall clock with the hoarse Westminster chimesHas marked our common hour. How many moreFree calendars shall grace the kitchen door?I love you when you're standing on the lawnPeering at something in a tree: "It's gone.It was so small. It might come back" (all thisVoice in a whisper softer than a kiss).I love you when you call me to admireA jet's pink trail above the sunset fire.I love you when you're humming as you packA suitcase or the farcical car sackWith round-trip zipper. And I love you mostWhen with a pensive nod you greet her ghostAnd hold her first toy on your palm, or lookAt a postcard from her, found in a book.Aside from the obviously telling what he feels about loving his wife of 40 years, John Shade (Nabokov) made references to his daughter who committed suicide in the last two lines and I could not help but feel the pain being a father myself. It is amazing how he feels that love for his wife and at the same time connect her to the pain of losing and missing a child.This book is a work of art - both in the story and structure. It is as if Nabokov wanted to prove that he was not only great in prose but more importantly excellent in poetry. I wonder who among the contemporary novelists can pull this trick together. I may not know a lot of YA authors but I guess Nabokov is Nabokov and there is nobody like him.Don't pass up on this book. It is not an easy read but if you want a rewarding read, go try this one. It's a strangely beautiful, beautiful book.
