*4.5*Well, that was a journey.I started this book in March, and put it down with no intentions of ever picking it back up. Skip forward to early October when I saw the movie (twice), and then immediately went out and bought another copy of the book (yeah, I was so sure last time that I gave it away. YEAH). FINALLY, I read the book. And it was awesome.I had to dock a half star for the tiny reason that originally caused me to DNF the book: the writing can be a bit irritating. Don't misunderstand me, I LOVED the science and math aspects, I loved how there were multiple perspectives and writing styles, but Mark's narration really got on my nerves sometimes! Like how he talks! Like this! All of the time! However, as the book progressed, I realized that there wasn't enough of this to make me fully dislike Mark's portions, so all was well.I also really wish that the book was like double the size so we could have had more time to get to know the Ares 3 crew, but there's nothing I can do about that so WHATEVER. I'M TOTALLY OVER IT.
