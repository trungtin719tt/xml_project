It's been decades since I last read this treasured classic (see what I did there? :P ) and thought it would be perfect summer reading. I devoured it in 2 sittings. Stevenson pulls you into the journey and for those few hours magically transports you back in time to the swashbuckling decks of the Hispaniola. But thats not all. By telling the adventure through the eyes of young Jim, you also get that wonderful feeling that usually escapes us adults, that life is an adventure and anything is possible.If you haven't ever read this do yourself a favour and pick it up, and for those like me who had forgotten that wonderful feeling and wish to recapture it, this won't disappoint.
