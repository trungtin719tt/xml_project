Detectives have artists' eyes; and artists have the eyes of detectives. I don't think anyone knows how much I want to be Sherlock Holmes. Aloof, apart, always observing, eyes wide open, untethered to worldly affairs beyond what immediacy makes necessity, quick-tongued, lightning-brained, spiffy dresser, grounded eccentric, sometimes passionate but never so much that the self is jeopardized, knows his enemies and masters them, instincts taut and fast and brutal like a bear trap, mysterious solver of mysteries, parter and navigator of the London fogs...A Study in Scarletis the first Holmes novel, told through Watson's recollections of meeting The Man, with a brief trans-Atlantic interlude (a lovely coincidence, I read this on my trip from Salt Lake City to Yellowstone and points in between, and the interlude in this book takes place EXACTLY in those places, a fact I was unaware of when I packed the book in my shoulder bag for light-travel-reading purposes)... the first glimpses into the interior of 221B Baker St., the first corpse (fun fact:in the entire Holmes oeuvre, only.4.cases were to do with murder), the first bloody clues, the first "The plot thickens!", the first "Elementary, my dear Watson" (actually, I don't recall this being in the book, perhaps CBS had the phrase copyrighted and retroactively eliminated it from all Doyle's books), the first message in blood ("RACHE"), the first suspect disappearing into the London night and out into the pages of our collective fictive unconsciousness forever. It would be a lovely way to pass a few of the long hours of this life, secluded from the green earth and its peoples, reading the complete tales of Sherlock Holmes. The power of myth, the power of fiction, is essentially the power ofmystery...
