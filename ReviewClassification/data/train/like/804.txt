4/5This won't be a "real" review, however I wanted to point out how I read this in Middle School and didn't enjoy it -- and now at 20 years old, I thought it was amazing! They're making kids reads this far too soon, in my opinion.Regardless, Steinbeck can really write well. I'm going to have to readEast of Edensoon!
