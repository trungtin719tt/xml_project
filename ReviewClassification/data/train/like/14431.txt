I picked this up with some trepidation, assuming that it would be full of stolid German angst and that I would give up after a couple of pages. However, it's a perfect psychological portrait! I loved it. Werther isn't an entirely sympathetic character (he has the odd Kevin the Teenager moment) but you are entirely drawn into his world and feel the same responses as him very keenly. It's only upon finishing that you realise how Goethe has managed to completely draw you into the concerns and beliefs of one character in such an extraordinary way. It's packed with beautiful descriptions of his surroundings and the countryside. Usually I hate long descriptive passages (as a philistine I often think they detract from the story) but these are perfectly balanced with the character portraits of the various protagonists. It's beautiful writing of the highest order (even in translation) and a perfect example of how obsession can ultimately lead to personal emptiness.Even if none of the above convinces - apparently Napoleon was a huge fan. He read it seven times.Note on the translation - I read Elizabeth Mayer and Louise Bogan's version in the Everyman selected works which comes highly recommended.
