A devastating account of the slaughterhouse that was the trench war of 1914-1918, not only about the loss of innocence, but about the complete destruction of human mind and the impossible task of maintaining a shred of sanity when everybody around you is blown to pieces.The decision to start the epic with a passionate love story a few years before the war and to end it some 60 years later with a generation that has almost forgot the horror serves well to emphasize the brutality of the trench accounts.I consider this book, together with Erich Maria Remarque "Am Western Nicht Neues", a necessary read for anybody who thinks war is glamorous or that professional killers are some kind of macho role models.
