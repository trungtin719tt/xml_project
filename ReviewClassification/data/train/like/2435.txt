This book is poetry. I can't add much more than what has already been said, in terms of message or analysis. What I do know, however, is that this is one of the most important books of our generation. One day, it will be taught in high school English classes, going Scarlet Letter, Huckleberry Finn, Gatsby, Catcher in the Rye, Fahrenheit 451, and then Fight Club. I'm not sure if there is a higher compliment that can be given. The significance of the book's message should not be dismissed.And even if it is, Palahnuik's literary style cannot be. It is unmistakable. It is fluid. It is transcending. His use of chorus lines make the book such a quick read that you'll finish it in a day. You'll find yourself repeating them in your head six months after you've read the book, long after you've forgotten the petty details. I think that's what makes the book so special. We are all 'Jack's inflamed sense of rejection' and it's been too long since anyone really put that into words.
