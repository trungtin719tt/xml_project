For the most part I enjoyed this little fantasy story, but the nonsensical language was a little too bizarre at times to the point where it seemed to overwhelm the story. Otherwise though I really liked the imaginative prose and quirky characters, not to mention the resounding message to readers that imagination and friendship are both limitless. I haven't seen this book's film adaptation yet but if the story is anything to go by, I'm sure it's an entertaining film.
