$1.99 on Amazon: June 8, 2015!I highly recommend this book for those who enjoy paranormal romance and especially those new to the genre. :)First Read: Feb 2014Second Read: Feb 2015Re-read withBuddies Books and Baubles Group.New thoughts: still loved it just as much as before. I had forgotten a lot of it. Bones is still one of the best book boyfriends EVAH! It was kind of an annoying plot device to end it the way it did(view spoiler)[ with Cat leaving Bones. Not that there was any doubt he would find her. But it was still kind of irritating.(hide spoiler)]Cat's mom is such a b!otch. Great re-read, though. Still one of my favorites.Original review:So I finally got around to starting this series. Why did I wait so long?! This book was awesome. It's got an amazingly sexy male lead, Bones, that is written how a writer should write a dang vampire. Dashing, hot, strong, intelligent, lots of banter and snark between him and Cat... the protagonist is not a Mary Jane, and she slugs drinks and fists with the best of them. Usually female protagonists in these books are a tad too straight-laced for my tastes. Cat is inexperienced when it comes to socializing and dealing with "regular human situations," but she's smart and strong and a badass. It's not a complicated book and has a pretty basic get-the-bad-guys plot, but if you want a good, satisfying vampire book, this is one of the best I've read.I think I've finally found a new favorite vampire series. My last favorite, the Southern Vampire Mysteries/Sookie Stackhouse books, was basically destroyed for me by the end due to horrible decisions made by THAT author.
