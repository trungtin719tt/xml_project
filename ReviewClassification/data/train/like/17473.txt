Here's the bottom line: Swan Song is one of my favorite books of all time. It stills impacts me every bit as much as the first time I read it.Swan Song is very dark, and it's scary, but it's also one of the most beautiful and hopeful books I have ever read.Weighing in at 956 pages, it's a huge story in every sense of the word. There are characters you will hate and fear as well as characters you will fall in love with and care about long after you've finished reading. There is magic, evil, goodness, hope, ruin, and beauty throughout the pages of Swan Song.If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic fiction, Swan Song is an absolute must read. I give it my highest recommendation.
