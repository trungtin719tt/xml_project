The Joy Luck Club is:...to hold parties and pretend each week had become the new year. Each week we could also forget the wrongs done to us. We weren't allowed to think a bad thought. We feasted, we laughed, we played games, lost and won, we told best stories. And each week, we could hope to be lucky. That hope was our only joy. And that's how we came to call our little parties Joy Luck.A mahjong table. Four positions to fill. The North, West, East and South. A game where the winner takes all, and the loser takes leftovers. Everyone's a winner. But there's a death, and the filling in by a daughter.Four daughters. Four mothers. Eight lives. Eight stories to share. All connected by the Joy Luck Club.The Joy Luck Club is a beautifully written poignant tale of Chinese women trying to fit in in America. It's highly inspirational, and I think everyone, even non-Chinese could use a little Feng Sui in their lives, in the form of The Joy Luck Club. Thus highly recommended!The book is mostly depressing, but though this is fiction, one couldn't help but feel the women's despairs and pains. The book feels real, not just to the touch, but to the soul as well.Heartwarming, and heart-wrenching. Bitter and sweet. The Joy Luck Club is a tale to be devoured and enjoyed by mothers and daughters. (but sons could enjoy this as well). And in the end, one could not help but be touched in the heart.WARNING:For non-Chinese readers, who have no background with Chinese names, prepare a pen to jot notes, because a particular trouble of mine was I quite mixing the women up and couldn't tell who from who. My excuse, I am not Chinese. LOL! :)
