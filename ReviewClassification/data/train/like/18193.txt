Brave New World beat out1984as the tyranny of choice. Consider smartphone addiction, people love to be enslaved 2,ooo times a day and beg for the privilege. I don't believe most people make independent decisions anymore, they just act out their programming.The first step to overcoming brainwashing is to realize you've been brainwashed. Do you fail to one star your DNF's? To do so is to cheat the reading community of their time.Is it because you are lazy or because you want to be nice? If you are doing it in order to get more likes, are you certain that strategy is effective? Or is it because your handlers have taught you to never question authority? Is three question marks in a row bad style?If you can't embody this level of skepticism you may no longer have a choice in the matter. Why do people self-censor? Is it training or the path of least resistance?If you are still reading this I highly recommend Brave New World Revisited. It's a checklist of how we got to where we are now.
