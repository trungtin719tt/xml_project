Well, first of all I have never taken one month to read a book. By page 100, I was struggling and wondered if I should continue. I went back and reread the reviews, that inspired me to continue. As the story of the war became woven into Trudi's life, I became more intrigued how 'little' person Trudi would learn to leave her insecurities and gossiping behind to help others and find love and peace with her life. The second half of the book has been read in just the last week.
