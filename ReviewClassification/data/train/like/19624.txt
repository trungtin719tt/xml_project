I was told to start with this book, but began with Inkheart instead. Inkheart is entirely of a different variety, totally magical, but this one is destined to be the classic. Set in the streets of Venice, this book has it all: Italian culture, street savvy kids, the Robin Hood-like notion of stealing from the rich to give to the poor, all the while echoing a sort of Les Miserables-like Griviche type thing.Everybody loves a gang of orphans! These orphans live in a run down movie theater and rule the streets of Venice, while their leader steals from rich families around the area to support them. Two new boys are taken in by the gang, which also means a private detective (sort of a Lou Grant a la Mary Tyler Moore character, gruff on outside but totally soft on the edges), trails them from afar, one espresso at a time.There are specialty shops all around the place, fountains, marble and antiques, mansions and canals, and of course, that romantic run down movie house as a back drop. In a world of wanna-be clever kids books that try to hard (Searching for Vermeer...blark--teach kids about art and Chicago, but make the story better than this...)this book is a classic reminder not to over look the basic archetypes and plot structures which have satisfied and guided reader and writers alike for centuries. Everybody likes a hero--and sometimes it's easier to take a spoon full of sugar to help the medicine go down: I bet tons of kids read this or had it read to them, and through unknowing osmosis, could now tell you a thing or two about Venician culture, artifact and landscape. Kiss that tired geosafari goodbye and remember how you learned what a moore was, and found that Yorkshire was a real place--you heard about it in a book!
