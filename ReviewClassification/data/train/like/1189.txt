I recently got into an argument with a friend about Lolita. I contend that it's one of the most beautiful books ever written, and that it's twice as amazing because Nabakov wrote it in English (which is his second or third language).She contended that it was about a child molestor and was inexcusable.I argued that it was more about chronicling a slightly off-kilter man's descent into wretched madness and total loathsomeness. A portrait of a child molestor, not necessarily a sanctioning of one.She held that whatever it was, it was still about a child molestor, and disgusting.To me, this is the same argument that Huck Finn is a racist book because it depicts racism. I don't think that portraying something is the same as condoning it.Plus, the way Nabakov manipulates language is chillingly beautiful. Chilling. So what if half of those chills come from the creep factor of Lolita being a kid? You find yourself seduced by his words and his worldview...and then you remember that he's talking about a kid, and you feel a little queasy.Hey, if it makes you feel, it's art, right?
