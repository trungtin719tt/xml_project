This book feels like a living thing in hand!!The last part make you ride a rollercoast of emotions..This book is about what lying to oneself feels like..The title"Rescue " really blend with the content of the book. The protagonist, Taylor is a voluntary firefighter. His life is determined to rescue people.Denise had been rescued by tAYLOR, PHUYSICALLY AND EMOTIONALLY. So is Kyle. Taylor fails in rescuing Mitch, another main event in the story. Taylor tries to rescue Melissa and her kids, trying his best to replace Mitch.Denise rescues Judy, from the worries about her son. And melissa rescues taylor from his life on lie. Mitch rescued Taylor from his lie-life indirectly.I discovered that, I want to be like Mitch as Taylor says about him:Honest, Straightforward and"who added something to everything he touched and everyone he came in contact with."And I learned that,I should strive to earn some trophiesfor extra curricular activities and find fun in that and make that a habit in my life.Evrything you do causes a ripple (effect)-in our own or others life./Most/ Favorite Quote:"How wonderful it is to love someone and be loved back".Taylors guilt and the ways he adopted to deal with that remind me of Sparks ability to form a "fn inside a fn inside a fn" in word game.Sparks has a unique ability to express things so.. so.. close to as if you are living in reality through the book."You are alone because you want to be"- Defines MY life.And.... I absolutely loved the epilogue!!
