This book is an extremely powerfully written book highlighting many of the horrors the men who fought in WWI experienced. Telling it from the viewpoint of a young man, Paul, who we first meet as a student makes it more personal for the reader. They enlist with the bravado of the young, fighting for their country, a sense of adventure that once in the trenches they quickly lose.The nightmare that was trench warfare, seeing your friends killed and many times not sure where your next bit of food would come from all leas to disillusionment and eventually that those fighting on the other side were the same as you. Even giving leave they find out they no longer fit into their old lives, wounded they receive substandard treatment from doctors and nurses who are overworked or in some cases want to use the injured soldiers for experimentation.A hard book to read in many ways but such a very good and important one.
