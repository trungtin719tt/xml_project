He loves his mother and sister, but he yearns for more from life.Laura Wingfield (24 years old) fancied a boy from her high school (James/Jim), the popular guy with a bright future ahead of him, but she hasn't seen him since she dropped out of school, because she was uncomfortable with the way pleurosis changed her, making her walk with a limp.
