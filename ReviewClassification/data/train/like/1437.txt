Matildais such a famous book/movie that I think it doesn't need a synopsis.So, I'll get into the middle of things and admit that this is my first time reading the book (and my first time seeing the movie). *hides*The reason I read this in the first place is thatMatildais my son's next book assignment. I felt nervous because I'm not a fan ofRoald Dahl'sThe BFGand didn't know what to expect. And yet I am thrilled about this book. I absolutely love it and highly recommend it (to those who, like myself, failed to read it until now).P.S. I very much prefer the book to the movie.
