Even though I was told, growing up, that King's work was somewhere close to the Devil (no, I was not evangelical), even since I began reading his stuff, I have been impressed. Stephen King takes ideas and strings them together like no other author to which I have a reading history.In 11/22/63, King takes us on a sci fi time travel adventure back into 1958 and the years that follow. The story is not Ray Bradbury in its sci fi nature. In fact it reads like any regular story set in the past. King is very attentive to detail, especially those as they related to life in the 1950s and 1960s (prices, cars, clothes, lifestyle) and the flow worked very well. I did not find a strain as the story took a long time to get to its title significance (assassination of JFK) and King used the time and pages to build some very strong ties in with characters and setting, so much so that I almost forgot where we were headed.Some throw backs to previous KIng novels is apparent, IT, THE STAND, and THE SHAWSHANK REDEPTION, were apparent, both in characters and setting, but that did nothing but move the story forward. Even some great character cameos made for a thrilling read.King underlines the theme of time travel and changing the past. How one block out of place can unravel the entire past and future. I liked the latter part. which lays out what can happen when strings get entwined in one another, One helpful change in time can ruin it all.I do not want to ruin the book for anyone, but you needn't worry about being a historian or political nut. It will sate all those who love a good King novel.Kudos Mr. King. Bring on more great books like this!JIMLA!!!!
