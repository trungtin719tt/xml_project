This still stands as one of my favorite books. The fantasy elements are clever and not too over the top. Ella is witty and pretty clever herself, not to mention strong and determined and resourceful. Mandy is just your everyday, ordinary, regular old cook/fairy. Char is, appropriately, charming. The stepsisters are deliciously evil. Lucinda is completely batty.I like that none of the women in the book are doormats. Good or evil, protagonist or minor background character, they have an opinion, they exert at least some control over their own destiny, they are quietly secure in the knowledge of their own power.The movie was terrible, folks, so don't go by that. (Anne Hathaway, why must you insist in being in movies that ruin my favorite kids books?)
