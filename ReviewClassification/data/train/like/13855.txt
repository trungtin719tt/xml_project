Excellent; one of the best works of historical fiction I've read. I gobbled it up and couldn't get enough in one sitting. This story of the Jews is amazing and seemed to me more powerful than any one account of the Holocaust I've read because it's not one individual's or one family's ordeal, but the story of an entire people - you really feel the tragedy of their history and the glory of their hard-won victory in gaining their own state. Beautiful and moving.From an old notebook I found this week (Sept 2010) - "Beautiful. And moving. It seemed more powerful to me than any one account of the holocaust beause a) it was a more complete (and disheartening) history and b) it was not the experience of one individual or one family but that of an entire nation. I admire the courage and determination of the Jews in reclaiming their homeland - and their dignity. A very powerful story."
