To tell the truth, I didn't believe it was possible. My copy of "Stardust" promises so much just by images on the cover - and the volume is so slim, barely reaching 200 pages. How will all these events and characters fit in such slim space? - I asked myself, and started reading on the evening of October, 2nd. By 4AM, October 3rd, I learned that not only it is possible, but also that Neil Gaiman is a talented, gifted writer with gorgeous imagination and invaluable, rare talent for recreating the noblest thing: magic.I think that the tale is really worth discovering for yourself, so I'll refrain from discussing the plot. Let me just say that few fantasy stories are as charming as "Stardust", which is a haunting journey from the border of the human reality into the magical land of Faerie. Gaiman mixes humor with seriousness, realism with fantasy, displaying skill rarely encountered that deserves to be admired and, quite simply, envied. His prose is simple and easily accessible, but in no way generic or cheap. The author's voice is never intrusive, and the tale moves at a surprisingly fast pace, switching effortlessly between several narratives which all are captivating and important - not a single moment is redundant. The descriptions are delicate and ethereal, and scenes are written in vivid detail - the tension at times is almost palpable."Stardust" is a sublime, intriguing and simply beautiful fairy tale, full of compelling characters that the reader is sure to find himself caring strongly for, taking a journey most unique and exciting. Take it with them by reading this wonderful, memorable book destined to become a classic. Neil Gaiman is a marvelous storyteller who knows all his spells - prepare to be enchanted.
