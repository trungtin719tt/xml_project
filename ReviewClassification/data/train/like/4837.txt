The reason authors almost always put a dedication on a book, Annie, is because their selfishness even horrifies themselves in the end.Goodbye sleep and hello Annie!I'm certain that my favorite book by King will always bePet Sematary, but this book came pretty close to changing my mind. And just like I'm sure thatPet Sematarywill always be my favorite, I'm also sure thatMiseryone will always remain my second favorite.I honestly don't know how King does it. This is, without a doubt, the most disgusting and the hardest book I've read so far. And I loved every second of it. (does that make me a weird person? probably)Now about the book...Meet Annie Wilkes, aniceold woman who likes to read (just like all of us), but who also has a hobby of capturing and torturing her favorite author (unlike all of us... at least I hope). Annie is one of those character that will definitely pay a visit to me in my dreams. She's even scarier than crazy Jack Torrance. (Wouldn't the two of them make an excellent couple?!)But on the other hand, we have Paul Sheldon. And, unlike Annie, he became my favorite King's character. Even though Annie made this book interesting, I loved hearing from Paul's POV. In my opinion, he as a character was even more interesting than Annie.And in the end, I'm just going to say that if you love King (or you're just a horror fan in general), but for some reason still haven't decided to pick up this book yet, do it. You definitely won't be disappointed. This is King at his best.
