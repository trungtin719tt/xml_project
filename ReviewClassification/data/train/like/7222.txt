Such a powerful drama! Williams presents his word-portraits so amazingly. As I noted when I readCat on a Hot Tin Roof, he also is a master of stage direction. When reading this play, it's possible to "see" the surroundings, hear the music and voices on the street.Stanley, Stella and Blanche come alive on the pages as Blanche drops in at her sister's home creating a simmering stew of growing emotion. The heat of a Southern summer is reflected by all that happens in the two bedroom apartment as stories are told and feelings unleashed.Now I must watch the film...just placed on hold at the library.Very highly recommended.
