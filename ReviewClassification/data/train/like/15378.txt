I started this book calling him Ernest Hemingway. Midway, my friends pointed out that I was referring to him as Hem. By the end, I knew never to refer to him as Ernest. More please...more nonfiction/memoir from Hem, if only it existed (some say there's more that was never published??...)This book was an intimate portrait of Hemingway. I was never a big fan of his fiction: though his simple, deliberate, sentence structuring still leave me in awe, I've never really been a fan of the flow of his stories. But even Hemingway admitted struggling with novels--he was the short story guy who was trying to piece it all together. He wrote "The Sun Also Rises," in six weeks, then spent months trying to put it into novel format. F Scott Fitzgerald wanted to help him edit but he refused because he wasn't thrilled about letting anyone other than his editors read it during the draft stage.Speaking of Fitzgerald--what great insight you get about Scott and Zelda. Zelda was a case, let's just say that. You also get to read about Ezra Pound, Joyce, T.S. Eliot, Ronald Firbank, Sherwood Anderson, Ernest Walsh, and more. What about the females? I had to remind myself that it was the 1920s. Though you do see him interact with Gertrude Stein (though she's not portrayed in a good way), you hear a mention of Katherine Mansfield (not in a good way either), quick mention of Karen Blixen (who he thought wrote the best book he had read about Africa) and Hadley (his wife) and the loving thoughts he had of her as he foreshadows their demise--making it clear that it was all his fault."But Paris was a very old city and we were young and nothing was simple there, not even poverty, nor sudden money, nor the moonlight, nor right and wrong nor the the breathing of someone who lay beside you in the moonlight."I felt as if I was breathing the same air as I read what he wrote, you could see the vulnerability, see his descriptions clearly, walk through Paris with him--cheers to young, up-and-coming writers in Paris (as if those days he describes still exist). He was poor, writing during the day, socializing and drinking at night (yay, writer stereotype) struggling with his writing, and upset whenever anyone talked about it to his face or told him he was a good writer. Pay that no mind though, because he makes it clear that he knows he didn't have the best attitude, he had a temper and somewhat of an obnoxious outlook.I enjoyed the personal rants, the writer who quit journalism to focus on his dream of writing fiction, but every now and then, he realizes how poor he is, and goes off on himself: "I was doing what I did of my own free will and I was doing it stupidly. I should have bought a large piece of bread and eaten it instead of skipping a meal. I could taste the brown lovely crust. But it is dry in your mouth without something to drink...You dirty phony saint and martyr, I said to myself. You quit journalism of your own accord."There were lessons littered throughout this book for writers. If you were to say Hemingway was imparting one in particular, it would be this perhaps, what he told himself when he couldn't start a story: "All you have to do is write one true sentence. Write the truest sentence that you know."
