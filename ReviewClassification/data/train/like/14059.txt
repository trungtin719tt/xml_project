This book was exactly what I needed at the time. Just a good story.I loved the parallel storylines of two boys born on the same day on opposite ends of the earth, and anticipating the convergence of them. These are usually my favorite types of novels.It's not the perfect read, though. As I was getting through the first 30 pages or so, I was struck by the feeling I was reading this extended prologue: you don't quite have that embedded feeling with the characters, you're just getting the lay of the land; a high level telling of story.The unfortunate thing is, the entire novel seemed this way. Sure there were points where I was empathizing with the characters, but at no point did I really feel as though I knew them intimately.Stephen King is by far my favorite author, and the reason for this is not only can he tell a story, you are also walking the miles in his characters' shoes. You know exactly what they are feeling, and why. Every novel I read comes up to this scrutiny. I need to know and care about (and sometimes hate) characters.Now, don't think that this novel is not worth reading, It certainly is. It is a fantastic story and I could hardly put it down. This is one of the few times I can let my rich characterization criteria fall by the side and simply enjoy where this story is going. There are surprises to be had, and the pacing of the plotlines was expertly done. I will absolutely, definitely, read more Jeffrey Archer!I wish I could give it four and a half stars, so let's say it is that.Very enjoyable, read it!
