Okay, I confess, I've actually read the first three of the novels in this fantastical series; but that they declined in quality so rapidly and profoundly that I just couldn't continue after that. Still, though, this first book of the series continues to be surprisingly strong, even if it single-handedly brought about an entire "goth industry" that threatens to turn all of Rice's original material into parodies of itself. A sprawling epic that is as much a vivid fictional history of the multicultural founding of America as it is a tale about vampires, it is this tale that forever entwined this particular horror staple with the dandiness of the Southern Gothic style, a union that wasn't so obvious before Rice, lest we forget. Ignore all the cruddier and cruddier sequels if you want, definitely skip the dumbed-down movie version, but it's worth remembering that the originalInterviewwas inventive and popular enough to inspire all those derivative tales in the first place.
