I am normally exceedingly wary of anything that Oprah puts her mark on and avoid it like the plague. However, after years of being recommended this book by many people who's opinions on such things I respect I finally pulled it off the bookshelf. Let me be the first to tell you: I have never been more appreciative of my friends. This book was phenomenal!Following the trials and tribulations of one Astrid Magnusson, the book takes you first from her idyllic life with her poet/ice queen mother, Ingrid, to the various foster hells she is plunged into once her mother is imprisoned for the murder of a former lover. Finch writes astonishingly well and makes sure that the reader feels every hunger pang, every slap in the face, every demeaning detail right in the core of their being. I went into this book expecting a quick and melodramatic read. I came out deeply moved and with tears streaking my cheeks, not so much from the writing but from the thought that all of the hells that Astrid is subjected to in house after house are actually being experienced by children in foster care every day. Astrid's struggle highlights the existence that a vast amount of this nation's children live, and that is the most horrifying thing of all.
