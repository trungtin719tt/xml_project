This memory play, narrated by an older Tom Windfield, is a look back at events when he was a young adult. Tom's father was "a telephone man who fell in love with long distance" and walked away from his family years ago. His overbearing mother was left to raise their two children. Amanda lives in her memories of being a pampered Southern belle. She does not have the skills needed in the modern world. Amanda worries about her daughter, Laura, who has a limp and is painfully insecure. Laura retreats to a fantasy world of her own, playing with her glass menagerie of tiny figurines. Tom is working at a shoe warehouse to provide for his mother and sister. But he longs to be a writer and is bored with his job. He goes to the movies and bars as a means to escape from his job and his mother.Amanda asks Tom if he would bring a "gentleman caller" to dinner to meet Laura. She would like to see Laura married and secure. Tom brings home Jim, a boy that Laura liked in high school. But Jim, who already has plans, is not the man who will be a part of Laura's future. Although Tom eventually left home, he was reminded of Laura every time he saw delicate transparent glass in a shop window.Tennessee Williams' real name is Thomas, and the play is semi-autobiographical. Williams found his home life and warehouse job confining when he was young, but always felt guilty about leaving his beloved sister Rose, who had mental health problems. Amanda was based on Williams' domineering mother. This beautifully written tragic play has complex characters, and conflicting themes of escape and family love.
