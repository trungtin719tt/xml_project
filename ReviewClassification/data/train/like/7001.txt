This book, this 3rd and final volume, is an incredible conclusion to this outstanding series. It has left me drained. It has left me heartbroken. But it has also left me in awe. I have followed Lyra Belacqua Silvertongue every step of the way on her amazing quest, and I could do it all again right now. This book is deserving of all the praise and awards it has received. It truly is a masterpiece of fantasy literature. Well done Philip Pullman, well done.
