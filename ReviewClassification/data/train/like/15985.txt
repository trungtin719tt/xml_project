When I came across this book in 1995, I had become very skeptical of the possibility of fiction expressing my worldview. Musil did.In the grand competition for 'best novel ever' I would have to put this one just slightly behind Proust's In Search of Lost Time, but this one is closer to my heart.Ulrich, the titular Man, dwells in a world that is in denial of its imminent collapse, Vienna before the first world war. It's not practical to summarize the plot, but it's also unnecessary. Musil manages to write in a way that makes the tedium of that world interesting. He writes of shocking events and evil acts without conveying, in the narrator's voice, the least shock or judgment. He manages to avoid teleology utterly. And yet he is not amoral; rather he is exquisitely moral, because he refuses to make morality simple.Musil completed the first book of the novel, which has an incredibly powerful ending. The second book opens with a profound shift in tone, and then drifts into no definite ending. Musil was harried into exile by the Nazis, and died before finishing the book, but in a way that makes the perfect ending, as the narrative explodes into fragments.
