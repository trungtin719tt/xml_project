Whilst I've been going through the Inheritance Series I must admit I've struggled and have thought about putting them down on more than one occasion.However as I've pushed myself through i'm so glad that I did - the world that Paolini has created is absolutely incredible, I feel transported to a world of dragons, magic and ancient lore, its astounding to think that Paolini wrote Eragon when he was only 15!I have been blown away by the depth of the storylines, descriptions of the scenery and the intricate characters - I cant wait to read the final installment, though I feel i'll need to read them all again as there is probably so much information I didn't completely take in!
