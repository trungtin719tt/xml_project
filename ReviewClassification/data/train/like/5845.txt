There's nothing going on in this book.That is to say, to be honest, it does nothing happening. The fact is that we are prepared there and participates in a vague social evening. This is not insignificant, perhaps, but still we admit that it is not too far from it.Yet it is in complete disregard of the emptiness of the romantic frame of this masterpiece, because what happens there really worth, it's a real literary revolution!It is because there has already been a time when women did not have the right to write! As crazy as it may seem today, they then had to hide behind their publications to the name of any man or take a pseudonym. And even when the unjust prohibition disappeared, writing has continued to be dominated by trends in the linearity and the logic masculine.And now suddenly, abruptly (at least for my humble self), we find here the writing of a woman unfolding as it exists and actually believe in her femininity. We spotted a thought that staring us in the face, that makes us dream, which also bothers us sometimes, but always better to bounce and revive the following passage in our interest advantage. Everywhere, the thread intertwine without getting lost, or finally, maybe they can get lost, but who knows if they lose nothing by waiting? After all, it follows no Mrs Dalloway only a few hours and it follows only in so far as really this is achieved.The whole had completely enchanted, entertained and captivated me. I felt like talking to a pretty smart woman, pungent imagination, irony and playfulness that does not leave me time to place one.
