This book touched me in a way that few books do. It made me want to work to become a better person. I was definitely in awe of the unwavering and deeply held faith of this inspiring Dutch Christian family before, during and after WWII. They assisted in the Dutch underground movement helping several hundred Jews and others in peril to escape imminent arrest, persecution and execution that would have inevitably come to those they were helping all the while realizing that these activities were likely to be reported to the authorities. But even more so, I was struck by the forgiving natuure within this family even for their persecutors. It is easy to pray for the sick, the needy, the downtrodden. But to pray for those who were behind the terrors and daily tortures of their incarceration - the kinds of torture often found during times of war - takes faith in God to a level above that of even the most devout Christians. But that is the kind of faith found in this family. They even found a reason to be thankful for the fleas infesting their prison halls. And their faith in God brought about daily miracles in spite of the most horrific circumstances. Truly an inspiring read!
