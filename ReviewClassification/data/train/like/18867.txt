This book is about a boy that is living I think that in the future, because of the Law that is happening in the book. The law of this book is that the families cant have more than 2 childs. So Luke the main character has to be hidden, he stays inside his house, and cant go out because if they see him they would kill him. While Luke was wondering by the window of his room he saw a face on the window from the "Barons" the family beside their house, the girl was called Jenniffer and she was also a third child. They both needed a fake identity and with that fake identity they could go and live with another family. But Jeniffer, Luke and other 40 third childs planned a rally, everyone was going but at the end Luke didnt wanted to go. So Luke then finds Jeniffer's father and he told him that the police had killed all the 40 kids and Jeniffer also.I really like it because it leaves you thinking in what will the life of Luke be in the next years. I would really recomend this book to you, for me it has been one of my favorite books that I have read. Also there are more books that follow upon this one that I WILL read them.
