Yes, I did read this because John Green told me to inPaper Towns. If I didn't have cooler people advising me what to read/watch/listen to, I'd never do anything at all.In any case, I was pleasantly surprised at how I wanted to continue reading once I finishedSong of Myself, considering that it's the only Whitman poem I was familiar with (since it's the one that's quoted in bothPaper TownsandThe Dead Poets Society. I liked most of the poems, although Whitman is a fan of listing things. Over and over and over. But he's nice.As an added bonus, one of his poems is super racy and includes, delightfully, the words "man-root" and "man-balls", which just makes me giggle every time I see it. Poetry is fun, kids!
