We loved this book and can't wait to read more of the series. The story and characters are very different from the Disney film. Mary Poppins is stern which I suspect is normal for that era and I do appreciate a character portrayed as flawed and I do dislike the way Disney characters if they are mean they are old, ugly and cross looking whereas the good character is young, beautiful and smiley which I think very misleading for children.We loved the magic in these stories, it's great to hear voices of characters who in real life would not be able to talk our language, so the dog chapter and the baby chapter really appealed to us. The magic is quite special and obscure and reminded us of Rupert Bear.We really don't like to read about zoos in stories and I suspected the zoo chapter to be upsetting especially given how long ago this was written but this chapter shows(view spoiler)[ the animals have put adults and children in cages and throw them food and make them do tricks which show the children how awful it is for the animals.(hide spoiler)]We appreciated that this author had considered this nearly 100 years ago.There were dark, scary, and sad parts and also a lot to think about. I can see why this author didn't like the film (although we do love the music and dancing) it is nothing like the book.
