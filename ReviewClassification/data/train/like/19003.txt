I found this to be a wonderful book about the aviation effort of WWII, it really told a lot about what the pilots went through, the significant losses compared to other groups. But it also told the story of the author's father Howard, the pilot of the Susan Ruth, (named after Steve's sister). How he and his crew were shot down over Belgium that 8th of February, 1944, and what happens to everyone after that.Then it really gets good! But you'll have to get it and read it for yourself to find out what all they endured, and all the things that happened with them. Its surely worth the read if you like this kind of book.
