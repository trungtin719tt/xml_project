This book is about love, friendship, and family. It starts off with a woman named Evelyn, who doesn't understand herself and is depressed, and by hearing an 80 year-old woman's story about Whistle Stop helps her develop her courage and strength. This novel is a historical fiction about the 1930s, so expect to read about racism. There is a mild discussion/example about institutional racism, white privilege, and many, many awful stereotypes. There are actually a lot of "isms" in this book that you will be reading about. This book could be classified as a political novel.There are a few things I didn't like:1) The story was out of chronological order. It drove me nuts. We would go to 1936 to 1955 back to 1940 to finish up the story of 1936. One smooth pace please. I understood why some parts were out of order, but I wish majority of it was in order.2) I didn't like the newspaper articles. Sometimes it did help push the story a long and told you of the next topic, but otherwise I just found is useless.Otherwise I liked it. It was funny, and sometimes sad. Very close to the movie as I recall, so bonus. I am so glad my favorite part in the movie was in the book. So glad. Evelyn was the funniest when she was discovering her feminist side. The feminist theories were very prevalent in this book, which I loved. I am very happy about it, because I haven't read much of those in sometime. I also think this book is still relevant in our time, especially right now. I don't want to start a political battle. I do recommend people reading this book if you get a chance and see the similarities and perhaps differences of the times.so, Towanda!
