Definitely not for everybody but by God (if he shows up) it's brilliant. But I wouldn't blame anyone for disagreeing with me. Still it's more accessible than you might think -- a student who studied this play with me in one of my university classes had the assignment of memorizing the quite surrealistic Lucky and Potzo monologue. Problem was she was a single mother and between that and her manager's job at the local Lotta-Burger she didn't have much time for home study. Her solution? She gave a copy of the monologue to all of her co-workers -- the cooks, counter workers, take-out window people etc -- and assigned them all to help her practice it during work hours. The results, which I witnessed myself, were hilarious -- cook and manager and counter folks all shouting 'Quaw', 'Quaw', etc over their shoulders at each other while they waited on customers... they all ended up having a great time and loving the play and in fact they renamed it in a fashion I'm sure Mr. Beckett would have appreciated: "Waiting for 'To Go'"
