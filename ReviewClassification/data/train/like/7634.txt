I actually started this a few nights ago and would read one story each night but completely forgot to add it to my currently reading shelf! I absolutely loved these stories, as well as Dumbledore's commentary. I learned some new things, and connected a few others. They were such a phenomenal addition to the books, especially Deathly Hallows. I will forever love The Tale of the Three Brothers, and it will always be a classic tale for me. I can't believe how much effort J.K. Rowling put into every single aspect of her series, just to make it that much more wonderful. I love how she wove magic into five completely different stories of her own making. This takes so much time, effort, and devotion and I will forever be grateful for all the love that she puts into her books. I will continue to reread these lovely tales whenever I need a little magic in my life. Hopefully in the future I will also read these to my children along with the Harry Potter series. Every addition to this amazing series brings me so much joy and I can't say enough good things. I highly recommend giving these a read! You won't be disappointed! She gave it her all and I could never give this less than 5 stars!
