I am an absoluteHarry Potterfan. I picked up the series when I was in college and was blown away by this mesmerizing and page-turning "children's book". J.K. Rowling is an absolute genius. I've always had an active imagination, and this world was so easy to enter. In fact, the world Rowling creates inHarry Potteris so real that I often find myself - and this is scary to admit - believing I can do magic. (Seriously, I once tried theAcciospell on my cell phone and was annoyed when I realized I wasn't advanced enough to do non-verbal spells and needed my wand...) When I read this series I laugh out loud, gasp in terror, sputter in anger, sigh with romance, cry in sadness, and smile with joy. This will definitely be a series I enjoy throughout my lifetime, reading them both on my own and with my children. In fact, I loveHarry Potterso much, that I named my car "Hermione" and have a picture of Emma Watson hanging from review mirror. Yeah, I know, I'm crazy...
