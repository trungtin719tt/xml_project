4.5 stars for this jewel. One reason I enjoy historical fiction is the educational aspect; learning about something for the first time. This is not your typical WWII/Holocaust book. This one tells the story of how the Danish people, after their small country was invaded by Germany, smuggled nearly the entire population of Jews (7,000) across the sea to Sweden, saving them from deportation and almost certain death.The story is told through the eyes of 10 year old Annemarie Johansen, and how her family participated in the hiding and smuggling of the Jewish people, and their involvement in the Danish Resistance. Well done Lois Lowry. Winning the 1990 Newberry Medal for outstanding children's literature was well deserved.
