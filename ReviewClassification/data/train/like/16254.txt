UPDATE: 10/12/14My full review:http://littleonionwrites.wordpress.co...I just finished The Blood of Olympus. Words cannot describe the emotions I went through. I cried because I was happy. I cried because I was sad. Gods, I'm so sad. I feel like everything worked out the way it was supposed to, even though I wish...But I won't post any spoilers here. I have to save those for my full review. But that was an intense adventure. I suppose now it's time to bid Percy Jackson and his friends farewell. I've been on this adventure since I wasten,back when my friends convinced me to start the series. Gods, I started this series before I even started Harry Potter! It's kind of hard to let go of Percy Jackson, though, you know?I've grown to love the characters so much, even the ones I wasn't so fond of in the beginning. The character development was phenomenal. Our beloved characters never failed with their wit and humor.We can always relive these adventures, but it still feels like we're saying goodbye.But we can always count on Rick Riordan, an amazing author, to bring us more adventures. We still have books to look forward to, guys.And now I'm going to go cry myself to sleep.*****I just finished HoH.Wow.Wow.Just... Wow.*high pitched shriek* I can't wait!!!
