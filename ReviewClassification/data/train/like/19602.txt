I hate reviewing books that I'm crazy about. I never can get across how wonderful they are. This is one of those books.Sorry Christina. Words do hurt.The universe has not been kind to Auggie Pullman. He was born with facial deformities. He has had multiple surgeries but he still gets people stopping when they see him and ugly remarks made about him.He had been homeschooled up until the fifth grade due to his many recoveries from the surgeries and I think to protect him from other people. His parents decide it would be better if he was exposed to people and he begins a private school. Middle school. Middle school kids are the spawns of the devil.I have a 11 year old boy who is in the fifth grade. He hates to read. I have no clue how I had a kid that hates books but go figure. I'm going to purchase this book and I'm going to read every single word of it to him. If I have to tie him down.
