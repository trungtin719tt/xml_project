This series - of which I have now read the first two - is the most fun you can have reading books. They make you want to go to rural England, hole up in a cottage, drink tea and read some more James Herriot. I don't want these books to ever end. As an aside, this isn't a novel, rather its a collection of short stories, each one just the right length for before bed.
