Another great read! Shakespearean plays are making my reading year so far.I was familiar with the plot and twists, since years ago I've watched and loved the 2004 movie. The play was lovely as well.Although, the ending made me cringe in a way I don't remember the movie having done.(view spoiler)[Demanding Shylock's immediate conversion into Christianity? The women giving that rant to their husbands after setting up the trap... Ouch.(hide spoiler)]I'll re-watch the movie promptly, to see how true it is to the original play.
