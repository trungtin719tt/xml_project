Now I shall spy on beauty as none as Spied on it yet.I read Pale Fire under the bed. I didn't roll around in the sheets and get sweaty and come at the same time like all of the sex scenes on HBO tv shows. I hid under the bed and I didn't look first to see who the bed belonged to. So long as it wasn't mine... Another sweaty body did the dirty on top and I could feel the springs pushing into my back down below. Paranoid body on top and apprehensively hopeful body below. Just below, me. Jealous wives and possessive hospital corners and family quilts. Hand of god? Who's hand (who's bed?)? Flatulence or rubbing I cannot tell as the sounds of pleasure and bodily functions sound the same. I didn't make a sound. This isn't a function, this is pleasure.Feet of men, surely. Shoes were on the floor. Shoes that turn into other shoes like transformers or shape shifting birds. They go with everything. Loafing loafers, leather strings and laces, swaying and strutting to leave by other beds and outside doors. Dirt on the bottoms from some place else. Shoes on my feet. Mums the word and dad said no. The traumatizing walked in and the lonely married couple and their poor, dead daughter. Eavesdropping like a compliment that is better to be savored later when you don't have to face it. I don't know what to say and am not ready to believe it compliment. Fear it won't come again and will never enjoy it compliment... Going somewhere. Is there going to be pillow talk? I'll pick the closet next time... I don't want to see their faces. I don't know what the hell happened and I can't see the whole picture, only the floor, the shoes and under the bed. I like being under it and not knowing the whole damned marriage. Or affair. Or was it a one night stand. Glow and not burn. I won't know what the hell happened. It's a weird kind of secondhand intimacy. Who WAS that guy? I've heard the theories and I was where I wanted to be in the room.
