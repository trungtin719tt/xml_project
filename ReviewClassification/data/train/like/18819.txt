Chicken soup when you're sick. Chocolate when you're hormonal. Lavender for your bathroom. Citrus for the kitchen. Pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving. Peppermint at Christmas time.This book completely spoke my language - that of food and how we are connected to what we serve, eat and order. We may not be able to put magic into our cooking, but as a mother I know there are certain things to feed my family for certain reasons, and that can be sort of a form of magic (at least to the little child in bed waiting for hot cocoa after being caught in a rain storm).Garden Spells is beautiful. Each character of the family has a special gift. Either through food, hairstyling, knowing where things go or giving gifts that will be needed in the future, they are all important gifts, but to the characters, sometimes a curse. But, in the end, they all figure out how to deal with their gifts and how to come together as a family.Then of course, there is the apple tree that will show you your future that is in their backyard. Would I be willing to take a bite of the apple and be prepared for what I saw or should I go through life, accepting each action and moment as it comes?
