This was a remarkable book. Obviously this concept has sprung from a real life situation, but to be based on its own merit, I think this is a piece of work to be applauded. The characteristics from this poor little boy, and the way in which his mum dealt with her limited situation was captured with, how do I say, accuracy.. it was very skilfully implemented. I was impressed with this work and can see it had the merit to have been a short list selection for the Man Booker Prize. How would I know what this would be like? I loved the physical and mental exercise that mum and son did together to keep Jack's body and spirit alive. As for the movie, I think I'd like to see it, in fact I am looking forward to it. I found the relationship between this mother and son to be lovely and real; one to be learned from. Recommended reading, which to be fair perhaps I should mention this was a book that many people did not like, and I noticed from here on GR that many gave up and did not finish. I really did like this. Glad I slotted it in to my ever growing supply of books. I love this conundrum!
