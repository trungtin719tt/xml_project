I went in completely 100% blind!!! Blind trust was all I needed, from trusted friends, but it took me forever to make this book a priority. I had 'Rebecca' downloaded on my Kindle since 2014. How foolish I was to wait.There are 313, 907 ratings.... and 13, 947 reviews, on Goodreads, ... with an overall rating of 4.2 Ratings like that SPEAK! It's not a hype either!!"Rebecca" is the most enduring classic of Love and Evil I've ever read.Mystery, gothic thriller, drama, secrets, crime, suspense, some parts predictable...yet not all... there are surprise twists and turns, three dimensional -unforgettable characters, gorgeous writing with vivid descriptions, and a beautiful estate called Manderley ."No wildflowers came into the house at Manderley. He had special cultivated flowers, grown for the house alone, in the walled garden. A rose was one of the few flowers, he said, that looked better pit them growing. A bowl of roses in the drawing room had a depth of color and a cent they had not processed in the open. There is something rather blowzy about roses in full bloom, something shallow and raucous, like women with and untidy hair. In the house they became mysterious and subtle".I loved it - I loved it - I loved it!It's TIMELESS......with more richness than many new release books of this genre.Special thanks to Jean, Sara, and Candy.... and to many other Goodreads friends who read this before me. REBECCA is a novel - once read -- we can never forget!!!!I'm definitely a new fan of author Daphne Du Maurer. Scapegoat was also phenomenal!!!PS..... I need to run out... but I must come back and start reading 'other' REBECCA reviews!!! I read the last 80% in one sitting!! I'm spent!I must go offline......but I'll be back - for discussions -- etc!Happy weekend to this lovely community!
