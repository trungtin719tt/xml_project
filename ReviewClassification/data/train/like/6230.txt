A MasterpieceOne of the best graphic novel i read everMy second reading for Alan Moore after Batman:the killing Joke and to be fair he is the best graphic author ever , if he was wrote only this novel it will be enough to make him the best coz of the idea and the imagination he had , but we are lucky to enjoy more of his Masterpieces .Many People don't prefer Alan Moore novels because they see it's so dark and in a Dystopia World , well he is right , the world is a mess and enough with the fairy tales and lies xDNow abouti loved it really , when the idea is good and touch u that is enough , over the last 6 year we saw a lot that makes this novel is remarkable and got more famous coz we lived it , the injustice , lies , dictatorship .the novel not like the movie, i repeat not like the movieit's not like the movie all about Evey and V , here is more characters and more lives , feelings , but same idea , the finale is different a little , i kinda liked the movie more .-Gordon character in the novel is different not like the movie , i liked Gordon in the movie more , the way he drew him as media critic comedian host like Jon Stewart and Bassem Yousef .-Valerie story loved it &lt;3 so emotional-V in his mask , costume , conversations , sense of humor and his ideas are all perfectWho is V ?he is my father and my mother , my brother , my friend , he was U and Me , he was ALL OF US .V character is one of the greatest characters i read about in book and i watch in movies &lt;3" People should not be afraid of their governments, Governments should be afraid of their people . "- Evey : most of us is Evey, the people who accept their fate , the injustice messy world , the people in prison all their lives , V set her free " I didn't put you in prison , i just showed you the bars ".
