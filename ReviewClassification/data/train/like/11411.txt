Loved this book. I read 'The Elephant Tree', Ronald's first novel last year, and had to pick up 'The Zombie Room' when it came out this year.Ronald picks up the pace in this novel, with WAY more action, more characters, and even a cameo from a character in his first book. I'm excited that he linked the two novels, evolving the world in which they belong... and also their stories.This novel deals with race, prison, violence, sex trafficking, illegal immigration.... and much more. It reads like an action movie, in fact, probably should become one!
