What an excellent retelling of Arthurian legend from the women in the classic legends perspective. I don't know why I put this off for so long - it sat on my shelf gathering dust for far too long. This feminist retelling is a must read. I know, it's 876 pages long, but it's worth tackling. I've never seen an Arthurian retelling quite like this one - I particularly enjoyed how The Merlin and The Lady of the Lake are the titles of an office with multiple people fulfilling those roles. Otherwise, it's fascinating to see what Bradley makes of this legendary cast of characters. If only it were easier to keep track of the multitudes of characters, though, since several of them have quite similar names. Plus, I definitely hadMerlinandMonty Python and the Holy Grailin the back of my mind the entire time while I was reading this.
