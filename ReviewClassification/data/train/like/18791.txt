Why do I even bother reading another author? Always in the nick of time I pick up a Steinbeck novel and it is a relief to read carefully and beautifully constructed sentences again. And the dialogue! This story delivered all the things I love and need from Steinbeck. As usual, it had me scribbling its sentences in my journal so that I may remember them and repeat them as my own. But I never will. I do not have it in me to summon these perfect, wise, funny things to say when they would be most effective. That's why I keep retreating into Steinbeck novels and living vicariously through the sordid, insidious lives of complex characters who grapple with their intense moral dilemmas alongside the country that shaped their paths to the very problem in front of them. I finished this story and did that thing where I held the hardcover gently and lovingly, for just a long moment, and then re-read the ending 2 more times.I just loved this story.
