To tackle this particular story takes chutzpah. But there's so much more to this book than a completely compelling reworking of what the writers of the gospels retold so long ago. There's the missing historical background the Bible doesn't give you, and the depth of the philosophical sources (Hellenistic, Persian, Gnostic) that went into Christianity at the very beginning, and then there's the incredible understanding of what Jesus was trying to teach us. Plus, it's all done in story, no preaching, no agenda, just you walking along with the Magdalene and Jesus, learning as they learn. Was I impressed? I don't think I've ever been so impressed.
