Reread: January, 20161st Read : July, 2014This installment could be the best ending if Cassandra Clare didn't do the City of Fallen Angels. Everything I am looking for in a sequel (and finale) is already here. Extraordinary plotline and pacing, engaging characters that continue to get better as the series go by, and the vividly captivating description ofIdris. This book is too powerful and well-packed with action and each chapter gets edgier. There were also more revelations here and new characters being introduced, and let me tell you that Clary also became a better heroine. If there's a certain thing that makes this installment even more beautiful, it's also theromance. I totally love the romantic development between Jace and Clary here. That ending! *sigh Cassandra Clare sure knows how to draw me to her beautiful world!
