Where to begin when it comes to "The Hiding Place" by Corrie ten Boom? I sit here at a loss for words because I know that nothing I can say will begin to display the emotions and thoughts swirling around in my mind. Ms. Boom's story touched a piece of me so deeply, I'm afraid that I will never be the same now. Seeing what she saw, hearing what she heard, things such as these will forever be with me.There are so many things that I have learned when it comes to this story, I would like to state just a few of them here below- not enough to give anything in this story away, but enough to draw you in so that you will want to read what this marvelous woman has to say."There is no pit so deep that God's love is not deeper still." -Casper ten Boom passed on by Corrie."'But,' she said, 'this is what the past is for! Every experience God gives us, every person He puts in our lives is the perfect preparation for a future that only He can see.'" -Corrie ten Boom"'There is sin in this world, and death and loss are consequences of that sin. But you know what? God feels it too. Every tear we cry? God sheds it too. He hurts with us because He loves us.' Her voice grew soft. 'I felt Him, Trent. When I was all alone, my shoulders shaking from grief, I felt His arms wrap around me and His peace embrace me, and I knew. I wasn't alone, He was with me.'" -Corrie ten BoomI cannot began to express to each of you enough the need to read this book at least once in your life time. Please, I promise you, you will not be the same after. You will laugh with Corrie, cry with Corrie, cry out with Corrie in the pain she had to endure, but most importantly God will touch your heart with the miracles He provided her with through all of this. Just take a chance, go back into history a little ways with Ms. Boom, you won't be disappointed.
