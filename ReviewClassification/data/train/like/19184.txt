I was born in San Francisco. It's been a long time since I've seen it. But reading this roller-coaster of a book brought it back to me full blast. No, I'm not old enough to have known it in the Twenties, but it doesn't matter which San Francisco you know, Longfellow's San Francisco will sweep you up and carry you from the top of Nob Hill to South of the Slot. The Slot was the track running along the middle of Market Street once upon a time. South of it was a darker "Frisco." But it's Chinatown and Li and Lizzie who got me. I used to walk around all those little streets wondering about a world I never got to enter. After this book, I feel I've been there. As for Lizzie, I adored her, the minx, the idiot, the sad little rich girl, so foolish and wise.
