How does one begin to review a play by Shakespeare!? Honestly, I haven't enough words in my vocabulary to do his work justice and find myself repeatedly blown away by both the depth of emotion I experience whilst reading him and overwhelmed at joining the generations whose long-lasting adoration hasn't allowed his name to become relegated to history.Whilst I have still only read a small selection of his work, I have found that Shakespeare has managed this ageless devotion due to the themes that permeate his writing. His plays are actually little about what the synopsis will tell you and are, instead, about the perpetual, driving machinations of the human psyche. Hence the timelessness. We are not such evolved creatures as we thought.
