Catch 22- If you are crazy, insane, then you are grounded from flying anymore combat missions. However, if you apply for this status, then you are deemed to be too rational to be insane, so you are denied the request. That's the gist of the idea, and it is so applicable to so many situations in life that the term has been added into our everyday language.Catch 22 is a satire, but not just any satire; it is the mother of all satires. And it doesn't just poke at the US military, it pokes at everyone, everywhere, everyday, at the way we accept the status quo, not questioning the absurdity of some of the rules of society.Capt. John Yossarin takes the moral high ground in his view of life, except maybe for sex; he is somewhat morally deficient when it comes to sex. But he understands the absurdity of Catch22, he just can't convince anyone else.This novel is pure genius, that's not to say perfect. It's a bit too long, and it's overly repetitive in some scenes, but that was Heller's intent, his way of driving home his points. I give it 4.5 stars, 9/10. Almost perfect, just not quite.
