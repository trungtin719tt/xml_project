***SPOILER ALERT!!!***Zoey's soul is shattered and it will only take two people in her life to save her soul; Heath and of course Stark. To be honest, I pretty tired of the whole 'I can't leave you Heath! I love you!' I was jumping up and down on my bed when Stark finally was part of her life.Aprodite of course was hilarious! It was kind of cool for her to have some parts and see her point of view in this whole mess. We got to know her better and loved her even more.Stevie Ray has a couple of parts (most of the book) that shows her point of view and lets us know a little bit about her life. Honestly, with the who Rephaim being a monster, just reminds me of the beauty and the beast. I sort of gotten annoyed with Stevie Ray and her rambling.Erik Night. Idiot. Period.The gay love birds, Damen and Jack, lovely and sweet. Loved them.The Twins? Annoying.Neferet. Can somebody kill her already?Kalona. And avenging fallen angel. Sexy. Hot. Obsessed with Zoey. Is he going to turn good anytime soon?
