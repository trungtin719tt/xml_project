A powerfully sad heartbreaking story about a simple minded man with a significantly low I.Q who undergoes a scientific experiment to enhance his intelligence. Charlie Gordon becomes the human guinea pig. The procedure goes well and he becomes exceptionally bright, during this brief time many lessons are learnt, although he becomes a genius in terms of I.Q he learns he is still emotionally stunted, he can't always manage his emotions in a rational way and many discoveries with regressions into his painful past come to light causing Charlie to reevaluate the decision of taking part in the experiment, just as he makes some progress forward in his personal relationships things take a downward turn and the tables reverse again. His new awareness and heightened knowledge becomes it's own curse. This is much more than a scientific medical experiment for Charlie but a life changing examination of his future, past and present. The fact that society treated people like Charlie in such a hostile and degrading manner made me feel ashamed about the way we devalued people with lower intellect. It's the nature of the superiority complex, which shows up so evidently in Charlie's case, in so many more ways than one. I was often overcome with extreme emotions during the reading of this novel and I could go on and on about the merits of this book. What I know is that once I started this book I couldn't stop reading it even though my eyes were constantly tearing up. So thought provoking with lot's to ponder over, it's definitely a book that will stay with me for a long time.
