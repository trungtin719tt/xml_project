Eric Carle's 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' is art in its truest form. It influences minds at a young age and is a classic, for a good reason. While simple at surface, it complies to its target audience with stunning visuals and vibrant colors. The style of the art frolics in tandem with its engaging narrative. The pages are three-dimensional and interactive, guaranteed to entertain and warm the hearts of the cynical (e.g me).The character arc of the caterpillar represents the unrealistic body image set by society and the poor protagonist that only wants to fulfill the empty hole in his mentality. As he grows, his self worth diminishes--his true purpose has been shrouded by ideals and goals that bring not happiness, but sorrow. What makes him truly happy is food, but society refuses to accept him for what he loves. Can the public eye not leave a poor, hungry caterpillar alone?Carle is a wordsmith and his work had advanced society in ways that are unappreciated, or even unnoticed. His rhymes are memorable to even the semi-literate toddlers of his target audience, toddlers that will remember his teachings until adulthood. It may not seem like it, but this caterpillar is responsible for the foundation of morals in several adults today that were blessed with Carle's words--we have learned from our noble protagonist for the better. Published in 1969 and still popular today, 'The Very Hungry Caterpillar' is a creation warming the hearts of many with the story of a young caterpillar overcoming his ravenous and reckless ways on his journey to become a beautiful, beautiful butterfly.
