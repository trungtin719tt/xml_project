Ha, I know that adding this book is cheating. But I just read a very funny review by a friend, which reminded me how much the kids and I enjoyed the movie of this. Even more fun than Horton Hears a Who. The latter is the highest Dr Seuss on my list, though, for its philosophical point of view.Personally I found the movie-Grinch rather scary. So, folks, if any of you find The Cat in the Hat scary at all, make a wide berth around watching The Grinch. He is sure to give you nightmares.
