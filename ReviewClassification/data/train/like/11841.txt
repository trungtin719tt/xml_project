Night Watchisn't the best place to start Pratchett, not because it would leave a bad impression, but because you just won't get as much out of it as a seasoned fan. That's because it's a novel that doesn't just follow on from the events of previous books, but that culminates, explains, and perhaps even justifies them. The plot may be close to standalone - there are very few facts a newcomer would need to learn to understand the plot - but the examination of, and recontextualisation of not only the central human character of Vimes, but of the broader character of the city of Ankh-Morpork itself, is the source of the book's power. It's a strikingly grim, messy and restless Discworld entry, eschewing the easy moralisation that Pratchett was sometimes prone to - or rather, the easy moralisation is there... but so are the doubts. How much evil can a man do in the name of overcoming evil? How much tyranny is permissable in order to protect freedom?Night Watch feels like one of the stories that Pratchett was born to tell - and it's also one of his masterpieces.My full review of it isover on my blog.
