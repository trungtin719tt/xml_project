The first half of the book was very slow, almost to the point where I was bored, but I kept reminding myself of the audience for which it was written and pushed forward. Karana's time alone on the island made me feel very sad; I could really identify with her loneliness, especially when she tried to row her canoe to the mainland. Nothing frightens me more than the thought of being alone in a small vessel surrounded by endless miles of water, and I shared the fear which eventually caused her to turn back to her island home.Karana was a very resourceful and compassionate young woman. I was amazed that she was able to survive 18 years alone by making meals, implements, clothing, and even jewelry from plants, wildlife, and local objects. She grew to love the animals and birds with whom she shared the island, nursing some of the wounded back to health and training some to be "household" pets.After reading the Author's Note at the end of the book, a search of the internet revealed several websites detailing the account of the real woman who inspired this story. There are conflicting reports because no one in California understood her language. I foundthis articleabout the archaeological dig on the island to be very interesting.It seems that the "Lone Woman of San Nicolas Island" was very happy to leave the island in favour of human companionship. However, it appears that life in California was not the best thing for her, for she had been on the mainland only seven weeks when she died.
