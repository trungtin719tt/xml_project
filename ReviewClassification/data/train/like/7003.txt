- Possible spoilers - Fantastic ending to a brilliant trilogy, although I don't know how many times I have read these books this last one breaks my heart every time. Will and Lyra's relationship blossoms so well over the course of the three books and I'm almost tempted to stop reading before the end and try and trick myself into believing they lived happily ever after!
