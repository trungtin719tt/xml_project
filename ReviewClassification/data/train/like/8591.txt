If I haven't already died... then there you go.DEAD! &lt;3Everybody, we haveTHE HOST TEASER TRAILERin this world now.http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BUkE5Q...First things first.Dear Author,Do you want readers to have an optimistic opinion about you? Do you want to be normal and popular again after your dramatic fail, you know what I am talking about, of-course, The Twilight series? Here are three steps to make your life better again.Tell all the publishers to stop printing The Host.STEP NO 1-Change the cover. The eye is just too creepy.STEP NO 2-Change your name on the cover to, "Bad author gone good- in the human world"STEP NO 3-ERASEThe following line, "Author of the twilight saga"And then let them print. I ensure you, The host will sell more than you have ever expected or imagined.Yours truly,Saniya.P.s... I still don't like you, get over it.Ahh. After reading this book for one whole week, I can finally say...I liked it.You: Hahaha, you are kidding me, right? You are talking about Stephenie Meyer here? Author of The 'twilight' saga, remember?Me: Hahaha, Sadly, I am not. -_-Let me show you a prove,"Unexpectedly moving.... Stephenie Meyer's novels throb with an overwhelming emotional intensity."- ATLANTA JOURNAL-CONSTITUTIONHere is the thing, whoever wrote this, was a really good human. The very first words said were my feeling,Unexpectedly movingand kindly notice the four dots, FOUR dots after that.The situation must be like:The guy/girl reading it, "Oh, I will hate this book anyway."Few moments after reading this book, *Typing on the computer* Unexpectedly moving... "Damn, what should I write next?"COPY-PASTE-COPY-PASTE. ~overwhelming emotional intensity shit~Her face, '=D' Net nowadays. Saves the day! :DEven after reading a future, dystopian novel, I liked it. (I hate dystopian novels like anything, nowadays) The book would definitely be confusing for readers who haven't read books based on the future or soul before, at first, but then it becomes easy to understand and follow afterwards.I think the only reason I finished this book so late was because the author wrote this book so slowly. One chapter consisted of her laying down, one of her eating, one of her feeling awkward and so on. This book could have easily been for about 400 pages if the author didn't use the pages unnecessarily on how the heroine was feeling and all.And after a few chapters, I also started noticing that the writing was somehow, forced. Not like, "WRITE IT OR I WILL KILL YOU" but like, "how can I make this book much longer than it already is." Some situations were so not necessary. It clearly looked like she was writing this book for a movie.Anyway, surprise surprise... or not. Saoirse Ronan is playing Melanie Stryder in The Host movie which is gonna be released in 2013. =D I am so waiting for it! ^.^The story was good, nothing that I could explain and yes.I LOVE YOU IAN! =DMARRY ME! ^.^I HEART YOU! &lt;3I, SANIYA, A HUMAN SOUL, LOVES YOU!I LOOKED UP ALL ABOUT YOU ON THE NET!I KNOW, I KNOW, I AM NOT A CRAZY STALKER!..actually I am... *hehe*GOSH, HOT! ^.^ Everyone wants Ian Somerhalder to be Ian. And if, IF he is cast-ed as Ian, If will die with joy and have tears in my eyes of pure happiness.Yeah, yeah. Give this book a chance, its really good, blah, blah, blah. And I will give this book 4/5 stars. :DBut seriously, don't make a trilogy out of this. Let it be a stand alone novel. Please. :)
