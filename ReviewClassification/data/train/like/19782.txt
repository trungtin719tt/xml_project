I was a little surprised to read that so many reviewers were put off by Hadassah's "perfection" when in fact, I saw her struggle with fear throughout the near entirety of the book to be a main theme. Her fear flared up in different ways throughout, but most notably and consistently in her ability to verbalize her faith - in full. To share the Good News. As the book progresses, she becomes more bold - she becomes more sanctified, more holy - but that's not to say she was perfect.I think our standards - and perhaps even our faith in God's ability - are rather low if we think Ms. Rivers painted a "perfect" protagonist. Perfection does not struggle with fear, the approval of men, and lust. She wasn't perfect, but she was a character worthy of emulating - from her consistent prayer to her practiced reliance on God ... even a fictional role model is much more than what we're so often presented with in modern times.I thought this was a wonderfully woven story with a believably righteous main character - because truly, with God, all things are possible. Including a life lived like the one presented here.
