Wow! From the first word to the last this book is filled with action and suspense. Such a wonderful new chapter in the House of Night saga. I loved the multiple POV's and the intricate storylines flowing through the book. How what we assumed in past volumes is turned showing that while Zoey is essentially the main character we are shown that it isn't just about her, but about the group and all the decisions and choices they make. How these combined choices form the world around them and will ultimately lead to their success or their failure.Even after the seventh book, this series is still so fresh and addictive and I can't wait to see what happens next!
