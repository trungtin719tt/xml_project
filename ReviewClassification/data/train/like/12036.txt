Man, this just keeps getting better and better.At first, I couldn't be bothered with Scarlet's story and had a mini heart attack when her story started because I thought Cinder's finished (idk man, I'm dumb)Anyhoo, this book was way better than the first one. Sure I liked the first book but this had a lot more action, a lot more loveable characters *cough*Thorne*cough* and Scarlet was a straight up badass. I mean the girl carries a gun. Nuff said.Oh and of course, Wolf was amazing.This book is very fast paced. You don't even realize you've reached the end until you reach the About The Author page.
