Wow! I was really surprised how much I loved this book. There are a lot of mixed reviews and it seems to me that people either. Hated it or loved it and I was afraid that I was going to be one of those that hated it. I love the Gothic Suspense genre and this book definitely is a classic so this was not the case. I loved it more than I ever thought I would. I feel that those that hated it just do not like the gothic suspense genre.The. Best adjective to describe this book would be mysterious. Vida Winters and all the other characters are all very mysterious. If you liked Rebecca by Daphne Du Maurier I would say that you will love this book. It is similar to this book.This book is a tale of gothic strangeness featuring the Angelfield family including the beautiful and willful Isabelle, the feral twins Adeline and Emmeline, a ghost, a governess, a topiary garden and a devastating fire.Vida Winter who is a famous author requests for Margaret Lee to write her biography Margaret Lee at first refrains because she has only written biographies of dead literary figures but then decides to do it. The author has always kept her mysterious past a secret from her millions of fans and the biographer is about to find out why? As the story unfolds Margaret discovers what they have in common and why she is chosen to write the biography.There is a lot of gothic atmosphere brewing throughout this book. The book discusses other books like Jayne Eyre, The Woman in White, and Wuthering Heights. I loved the twins Emmeline and Adeline, this is just a way to describe them which is written word by word in the book. "The twins were odd. There were no two ways about it. They were strange all the way through into their very hearts."I also noticed that things happened in threes, throughoutthis book.Pick this book up if you are into mysteries with psychological twists and ambiance and above all suspense. This is tragic tale of arson, incest,insanity, abandonment and murder.
