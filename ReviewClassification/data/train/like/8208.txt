Waiting for Godotis deep, dark and bold, exploring many complex and surprising themes. My favourite Beckett novel next toMercier and Camier(Ironically, bothWaiting for GodotandMercier and Camierinspired the 19th episode of the Canadian TV seriesOnce A Thief, a show I absolutely love from the 1990's.Waiting for Godotis philosophical but not in a pretentious way, and isn't afraid to break boundaries by introducing themes of everything from bizarre humor to suicide (luckily these two protagonists never get so far as to actually go through with it!) and it's an oddly timeless story that never seems to go anywhere yet it's everywhere all at once.
