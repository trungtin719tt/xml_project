3.5 starsSarah Dessen's characters are dramatic and sometimes way over-the-top but in this case it kind of worked really well. I liked Auden even though she could be a hard person to understand at times, but, hey, so am I most of the time. I LOVE FAMILY DYNAMICS. I keep repeating myself but that's what really connects me with the story and Sarah Dessen always delivers great family dynamics (even though both of her parents are selfish but insecure idiots here) that develops over time. I loved the supporting characters - Auden's group of friends at work and Auden's step-mom and step-sister. What bothered me is that Eli is most definitely not explored enough as a character which led to me not really warming up to him (even though he's a cute night owl, but still) and not feeling the spark between him and Audenthatmuch. But I really liked the story itself and Sarah's writing style, as always. Auden is one of Sarah's better protagonists, in my opinion. This may not be my favourite Sarah Dessen book but it's definitely in the top 5.
