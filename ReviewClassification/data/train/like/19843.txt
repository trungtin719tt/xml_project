**Only $0.31 at Amazon US, 5/5/14- YES, 31 CENTS!****4.5 stars**Wonderful, guilty-pleasure, angsty teen goodness!!When it comes to rating these hurt-comfort teen stories I tend to just go with my gut and let reason fly out the window. Sure, this book has its fair share of issues. Everything is wrapped up perfectly and neatly, everyone gets over their issues in a timely fashion, and the bad boy is tamed by love. However, did I love it?You bet your butt I did!!I have a weakness for big brothers caring for younger siblings after the death of a parent (seeStorm). What can I say, I love a strong man who puts his siblings ahead of himself. Noah was a character I could get behind. And I liked the way his relationship progressed with Echo. It felt nicely paced to me and not insta-love-ish. I appreciated the talented writing and the restraint of Katie McGarry. I dug them together.I think that the story that captivated me the most was Noah's, actually. I enjoyed his voice the best. I felt like when the writer was talking as Echo, my feelings were being more manipulated, if that makes sense. However, I honestly loved reading each page of both Noah and Echo's journey.I have to say, though I really liked the main characters, the secondary characters were just loathsome. I wanted to bitch-slap Grace so hard!! She is a (insert nasty word HERE). I also didn't forgive Ashley (aka daddy-stealer... what? I would never get over that "I just wanted to be your mom so badly" BULL) and her emotion-void father.I think what pushed this to 5 stars for me was how well the author pulled me into the main character's lives. I was completely invested in their stories and I caredso freaking muchabout what happened to them. That is saying a lot.When I saw that there was a second book in the series, I was PISSED. I thought it would be a continuation of Echo and Noah's story (which, by the way, would have been totally unnecessary). I was so happy I could have done a little dance when I saw that it was Beth's story instead. Kate McGarry got the memo to leave well enough alone!!! (note: listen up Colleen Hoover!!!). I will most certainly be moving on with this series.**Copy provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review**
