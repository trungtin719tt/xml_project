In the blink of an eye. Everyone dissapears. GONE. Those three lines pretty much sum up the plot of the book, and was cleverly placed on the front jacket cover. Michael Grant phenomonaly captured so many different plot elements and combined them into a dystopic apocolypse that resembled Lord of the Flies, yet also added an element that gave characters unique abilities (like one of my favorite TV shows, Heroes).Every character in this book has dymanic, none of them fall flat at all. There are opposing sides between the main protagonist, Sam, and the lead antagonist, Caine. Each recruits their own group of other teens and followers under the age of 15 (because when you turn 15, you dissapear). Every single person must find a way to survive without adults and technology to aid them. It's somewhat like a parallel universe, just better.This book has everything in it, and I still remember most of it from reading it a few months ago. It has the whole Sci-fi/fantasy element that is garnered from the plot. It also has a lot of action/adventure due to the teens struggle to survive while fighting each other. And finally, it has young-teen romance, which I think everyone appreciates it. This book may be thick, but it was a really quick read for me. I hope that it becomes just as popular as Twilight and Harry Potter, because it definetly deserves to be.
