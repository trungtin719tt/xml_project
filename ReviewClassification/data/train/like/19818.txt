"Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.""Life is an oasis which is submerged in the swirling waves of sorrows and agonies."Never have I found a couple of lines in a novel that so perfectly sum up the writer's oeuvre for me. To those, I'd add, "Gloom, despair and agony on me" from an old TV song.This was my first Hardy novel, reading it last July. In the six-plus months since, I've made myself a Hardy punching bag: Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Return of the Native, and Far from the Madding Crowd.I may need Treatment.This Hardy tragic novel, published in 1886, was set in the first half of the 19th Century. Still, the set up is far-fetched compared to the other three. Here we have a drunken Michael Henchard who sells his wife and baby girl Eliza-Jane to a sailor.You think that's bad.... If anyone can transform bad into worse, blue into black, it's Hardy.After recovering from his hangover, Henchard repents and desperately searches for his family to no avail. He gives up booze cold turkey, becomes a successful merchant farmer and is elected Mayor of Casterbridge. The former Mrs. Henchard returns with daughter Eliza-Jane years later when the girl is 18. The story takes S-curves and turnabouts until Henchard's pride gets the best of him, he returns to booze and he's ruined emotionally and publicly.I'd say this story has a few morals:1. Drink in moderation.2. No matter how bad things get, never sell your wife or children.3. "Pride goeth before destruction; and an haughty spirit before a fall." Proverbs 16:18, Bible, KJV
