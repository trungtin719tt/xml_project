As masterworks go this one checksAll the boxes a lit prof expects.But a colt seeking brioMight've wished author LeoHad condensed one calledWar, Peace, and Sex.I once submitted a limerick toPoetry Magazine, and got a letter back saying I'm Bard for Life (only they used what must have been an Old English spelling: "barred").All kidding aside, I really did read this back in my student days. I may have skimmed 100 pages of battle scenes, but felt at the time at least, that I could count it as done. My overall impression was that it probably deserved its exalted status. Some classics seem stodgy to a 20-year-old, but this one somehow resonated for reasons I no longer recall. Hence the frivolous non-review.
