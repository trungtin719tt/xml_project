You can't quit this, and you can't put it down.It's a giant something super delicious slipped between two covers and you can't devour it quickly enough.And it's startling. And thought-provoking. And memorable.And the story races along, pretending it's just some white-knuckling, heart-racing, page-turning pulp fiction, but it sucker punches you. Reminds you that Stephen King is classically trained, and he can wax poetic if he wants to.I read this 842 page book in 9 days, and I love it so much, I wish I'd written it. Most especially these lines:For a moment everything was clear, and when that happens you see that the world is barely there at all. Don't we all secretly know this? It's a perfectly balanced mechanism of shouts and echoes pretending to be wheels and cogs, a dreamclock chiming beneath a mystery-glass we call life. Behind it? Below it and around it? Chaos, storms. Men with hammers, men with knives, men with guns. Women who twist what they cannot dominate and belittle what they cannot understand. A universe of horror and loss surrounding a single lighted stage where mortals dance in defiance of the dark. (615-616)
