It was not at all what I expected after watching the awesome movie.. The movie was merely a third of the book and although the basic plot was same, the vengeance that Edmond Dantes takes is quite different . I was disappointed at first to read the different characters (there are many characters) which weren't in the movie and seemed irrelevant but actually they are completely relevant owing to the fact that the next 2 thirds of the book are nothing like the movie...**Spoiler**I wish Edmond had ended up with Mercedes as he does in the movie and I actually found myself feeling pity for the Villefort family. They did suffer a lot. I hated Mme Villefort. She just doesn't give up poisoning.. I Wish Danglers too had finally found that it was Edmond who caused his ruin but actually he fleas before that.Overall, I loved it, especially the first and last thirds as they were so so thrilling and I read them quite fast. The middle part was kinda slow partly due to the introduction of so many new characters and their lives and because we don't immediately know the plans of Monte Cristo for them.. If you have watched the movie first as I did then please don't expect the revenge to be as small as it was in the movie. You have to have patience and let the book do its magic.
