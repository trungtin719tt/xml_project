Death had always been a major theme of these books, butGoblet of Firewas really the turning point of the whole series. Not only did Voldemort return, but we found out that the Wizarding World is much larger, and(view spoiler)[ Cedric is killed(hide spoiler)].The characters become more real yet are still stuck in flux between child and adult, which is apropos seeing as how this book is literally in the middle of the series.
