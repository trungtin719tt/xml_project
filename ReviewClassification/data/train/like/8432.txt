Not sure why I have never read this before but I really enjoyed it anyway. Usually I am not a fan of court room dramas but the way this one alternated the court room scenes with background information and scenes from the past was wonderful. The representation of the Japanese people was a little stereotypical - no, a lot stereotypical - but it did not spoil the fascinating story. I was interested too to hear about this chapter in the history of the war. I knew about the way anyone with any German heritage was rounded up in England, but I did not know about the Japanese in America. It was a very low point for humanity around the world. This is a good book anyway and worth reading for anyone who has not already done so!
