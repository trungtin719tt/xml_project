This book was surprisingly good... a surprise because most books written around this time (I believe this was written in 1909) seem to be very boring and/or difficult to read. I have seen the play (and loved it) and was always curious about the original novel, which, I'll say right now, is definitely worth reading. Very captivating and suspenseful and emotion-invoking. My only real complaint is on the character of Raoul who is often described as what I would call a "weenie" - crying alot and full of soap opera-like emotions that make you feel embarrassed. The Phantom is way cooler. But also, most of the story is told from Raoul's point of view on things, which is also sort of a let-down. (It is not, however, written in the first person.) For anyone who doesn't already know the story I will expound on it: so the story is a French 'legend' (if you will) of the 'Opera Ghost' who roamed under the Paris Opera House in the late 1800's. This ghost falls in love with one of the girls in the opera whose name is Christine and whose boyfriend is Raoul. So it's kind of a love triangle but it works out ok - trust me. The ghost is a very intriguing character because he is a genius and he is extremely ugly so he wears a mask everywhere and is very mysterious. I don't want to give too much away for people who want to be surprised but I will say that the original story was surprising in alot of good ways. I enjoyed it alot. There were a few slightly long-ish sections but the epilogue was worth reading because it delves into the phantom's history which was very interesting. The end of the story made me quite teary-eyed. It really is a great story.
