This much anticipated book in the series is finally here! YAY! This did not take me long to read at all, but I must say I am very pleased! The story starts right where it left off in the last book with Zoey and the gang in the underground tunnels with the red fledgings. What happens is not something I expected, her ex-human boyfriend shows up and that's when it gets ugly. Zoey is forced to go back to The House of Night or she will die. The one person who gets on my nerves here is her ex-human ex-imprinted imprinted again boyfriend. I thought we were rid of him last book, but alas! We are not! At the end of this book Zoey finds herself wrapped up with 3 guys again and not sure what she wants to do! I hope the next book has a little bit more story into the men in her life! Overall, wonderful!
