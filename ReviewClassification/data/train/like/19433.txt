Whoa, these books...I read the first page &amp; I instantly knew I'd like it. That doesn't happen to me much. I'd forgotten how you can get so involved in a book that it becomes merged with everyday life, do you know what I mean?I remember reading Frostbite in the freezing cold (hehe) waiting for the kids I was babysitting to get to sleep. I think Rose was at a spa, &amp; I think I just simply forgot the cold, feeling like I was at a spa, too. Is that weird?*sigh* I'm not being organized about this at all.I loved them all, the end of Shadowkiss broke my heart.
