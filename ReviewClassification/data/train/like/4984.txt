Between 1938 and 1940, author T.H. White wrote five novels that treated, fictionally and humorously, the Arthurian Legend. The first four, with slight modifications, became THE ONCE AND FUTURE KING in 1958. Sixty years later, the book retains its curiously bivalent ability to charm, tossing adventure at kids and winks at knowing adults,Even in the first book, THE SWORD IN THE STONE, we see the duality at work -- "Wart" (who grows up to be the adult King Arthur) is challenged by the usual coming-of-age trials beset a budding king who is put down by a distracted Godfather (Sir Ector) and with a dolt of a mentor (Sir Kay) to look up to (or try).Yet at the same time, author White delights us with anachronistic goodies like owls who chant from "Hymns Ancient but Not Modern"; the fear of Fascism is nicely allegorized in the tale of the workaholic ants and their soul-deadening "Mammy" songs. This treasure must be read, whether or not first-time readers finds White's digressions delightful or merely distracting.In fact, the more one knows of the Arthurian Legend, the more "intertextual involutions" from overlapping sources enlighten and brighten the reading experience. The price right now (August 16, 2018) makes it particularly compelling. Tally Ho!NOTE: The final book in the series,The Book of Merlyn, is still available in the USA only as a standalone. - a.s.
