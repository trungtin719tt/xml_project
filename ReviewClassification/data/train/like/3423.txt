I had settled down to write a glowing, gushing review that would make theidiotspeople who haven't read this, drop everything and get their hands on this one and bask in the glow that isKatniss Everdeen.Yep, you read that right. As good as the plot, the writing and everything else is, the protagonist Katniss, outshines them all effortlessly. She is brave, courageous and strong, oh so strong.So, anyway, about the review: Nothing I can say/write can't even begin to summarize just how awesome, beautiful, heart-breaking itwasis. Just imagine all the things that blow-you-away, that make you cry, that make you laugh, that make you love, that give a warm glow to your heart, that make you smile through your tears, that make your heart ache, that make you want to be a better person and combine all of them. The result:The Hunger Games Trilogy.[image error][image error]
