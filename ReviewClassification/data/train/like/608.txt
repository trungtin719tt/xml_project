I just finished this book in the early hours of the morning, and I'm left with a heavy but happy heart and a smile on my face. I clung to those last pages like nothing else - not wanting the story to end - and this is even a reread for me.This goes to show how much I love this book and this journey of Jane. I think what I love the most is exactly the fact that it takes you on an amazing journey, and Jane changes so radically from beginning to end. As a reader, you are rooting for her and your feelings are on their peak from the very first pages when she's being treated so cruelly.Another thing that makes me love this book to pieces is tbe fact that the two main characters are not beauties - the hero and heroine are actually quite ugly, but they find each other - maybe exactly because of that. Finally, we get a story which is not about perfect princesses or handsome princes - this is about common people and that makes it SO MUCH BETTER!I will say that the men in this story raise questions and they are quite unbelievable at times. They behave in such a way that is hard to understand for a modern reader; but I guess that was common back in the days. Nevertheless, that doesn't degrade the book for me in the least.This was a reread for me, but I kept being surprised anyway by the story and the twists and turns. This is a MUST READ and I cannot recommend it highly enough. Beware, because you will be taken on a most wonderful and amazing journey - and good luck!
