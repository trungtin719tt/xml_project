"You are an ordinary guy and your wife's sister comes to stay with you," began Mary McCarthy in the Partisan Review. "Whenever you want to go to the toilet, there she is in the bathroom, primping or having a bath. My God, you yell, can't a man pee in his own house?" This variation on the mother-in-law joke, which stunned Broadway in 1947 with the heroine's rape, swiftly became an American classic with such lines for the sex act as "getting those colored lights going."On arrival Blanche, played by Jessica Tandy, was the focus of critics. NYTs Brooks Atkinson devoted a graf to the characterization, then added briefly that others were Brando, Karl Malden and Kim Hunter. But, within weeks, Brando dominated theatre talk. My visiting from Los Angeles grandmother, who couldn't get a ticket, did standing room -- and fainted ! A religious person, she found the suicide, incest, insanity, drunkenness, homosexuality and rape too much. Worse, the vulgarians played cards and the heroine used cheap perfume.In his notebooks, director Elia Kazan wrote that it was a poetic tragedy - "the final dissolution of a person of worth." For him, Blanche was a social type who symbolized a dying civilization...the genteel tradition of the old South. Now, she was outdated like the dinosaur. Stanley, "who sucks on a cigar all day because he can't find a teat," must bring her right down to his level, beneath him. So he levels her with his cock.A tragic triangle : Blanche, Stanley, Stella. To finally accept Blanche, Stella would then have to return to the subjugation of the Tradition : childhood, younger sister, the South. Stella must be narcotized to forget the price she's paying for a kind of salvation. She's doomed too.The "Streetcar" comes to the last stop at the end of the line.
