"Someone has been roasting a waxen image of me". Why is it that certain things you read in your youth stay with you forever? So it has been with this sentence from The Mayor of Casterbridge, which I had to read in school. There are many things that have stayed with me from those days, but little quite as much as this book. I am not sure why. Maybe it is the credible characterisation, maybe it is the subtle turns of plot that make you smile, frown, cross and shout in fury at the pig-headed yet immensely warm protogonist Henchard. Maybe it is the wonderful vocabulary. Maybe it is just that this is a delightful story, which I have read again this week, and enjoyed every bit as much all these years later as I did then. Thank you Mrs Rooke, my English teacher, for making me read this book. And if you read this review, I hope it inspires you to read The Mayor of Casterbridge. It will stay with you for a long time.S Pearce, author ofMo
