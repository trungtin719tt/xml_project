Goodness this is beautifully written! This is easily the best memoir I've ever read, and I absolutelycould notput it down.Jeannette Walls shares the story of her childhood, growing up poor in Welch, West Virginia. To give you an idea of how poverty-stricken Welch is, it's the place where America's first food stamps were handed out.Jeannette is the daughter of an incompetent, mentally ill mother and a clueless alcoholic father. But don't worry. It's not what you might think at first glance. This is not your typical cringy, shock-filled memoir. This is a gripping true story of laser-focused perseverance and hope.This is a story about people with major issues (in this case, the parents) doing(I guess)the best they're capable of, even though it's not nearly even close to being good enough for their children.This is a beautiful story of strength and survival -- having to raise yourself -- having tosaveyourself and your siblings. This story is lovingly told, not hate-filled at all, which demonstrates how children can't help but love their parents, even when they're being failed by them.
