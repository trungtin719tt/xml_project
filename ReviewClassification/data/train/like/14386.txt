I was skeptical of this book at first, however, I am so glad that I stuck with it. I reached a point where I didn't want to put it down (yes, I did stay up all hours reading it...). This book entails a young woman's sudden decision to travel to the poverty-striken Applachain Mountains and become a school teacher. Her lifestyle dramatically changes from a normal, safe, and predictable life to one with primitive accomodations (no electricity, telephones, plumbing), surrounded with filth, disease, and the dangerous superstisions of these woodland people. Living among these rough, mountain folks, seeing them suffer in their stubborn ways, and witnessing the death of those she comes to love, she begins to question her faith and doubt the existence of a God who could allow this evil to happen. Her faith is tested to the limit, and she must figure out for herself what truth is--simply accepting the word of others without knowing it for herself is not enough to sustain her.Marshall's writing is profound and applicable to people's lives today. Because all people come to place where they question reality. You will also appreciate the underlying love story--with a surprising twist that doesn't conclude until the very last page. If you find the first part a little hard to get through, keep going. It is so worth it!This book will make you question reality. Is your faith really yours? Is what you believe really the one, enduring, TRUTH?
