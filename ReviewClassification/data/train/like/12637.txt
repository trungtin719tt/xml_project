This is my 9th Newbery Medal book and maybe the best so far. Well written with good characters, especially Kit Tyler, the young lady who is the heroine of the novel. There is a bit of a history lesson here also since the setting is 1687 in Wethersfield of the Connecticut Colony where the heavy handed Puritan's are dispensing their brand of religion and law. You can get an idea of the plot from the book description, but it plays out on the pages so well with such a strong, young female character that it's just a pleasure to read.1979 Newbery Medal winner.
