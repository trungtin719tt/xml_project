Possibly the greatest compliment that I could give this book is to say that it reminds me, in a non copy-cat way, of the first fantasy series to really sweep me away in my teenhood! That would be none other thanThe Belgariad Seriesby David Eddings!!Sabrielis a story about a badass heroine who is charged with saving the world!I love that shit, guys!!The world building, although at times tedious, is amazing - I love the way this world is created, how death itself is portrayed AND necromancers.... I love the idea of necromancers!! (Theoretically, of course) The writing, while sometimes slow, is really well done. The characters - especially Sabriel herself - are wonderfully dimensioned. The evils and dead creatures are masterfully depicted and fantastically intertwined.Chris was RIGHT!! (Ugh I hate saying this :P)I love me a badass female.... one who has responsibilities that she didn't ask for but trudges on ceaselessly because shehasto.... the very world she knows depends on it! Sort of spoiler:(view spoiler)[ I thoroughly enjoyed the love interest here and that Touchstone didn't even appear until over the halfway mark. Instalove *boohiss* this romance didn't feel to me. I will note that I guessed his linage very early BUT I really don't think it's supposed to be a surprise to the reader. It took nothing away from the story, for me, that I guessed it almost the minute he showed up.(hide spoiler)]Her burden, no matter how heavy, and how feeble her shoulders currently felt, she had to bear it.I'm excited to read the next in the series.... I think Nix may be myNin my A-Z Challenge, guys!Gifs courtesy of the fact that I restarted watching "Buffy" while on winter holiday!
