My life was an unending, unchanging midnight. It must, by necessity, always be midnight for me. So how was it possible that the sun was rising now, in the middle of my midnight?When I first heard a little over a month ago thatMidnight Sunhad been leaked and would be "on hold" indefinitely, I was incredibly sad. For Stephenie Meyer, yes, because her trust had been broken, but for myself as well. Selfish, I know, but I was so looking forward to having a nice hardbound copy ofMidnight Sunto place on my bookshelf beside the otherTwilightbooks. Now I don't know if that will happen.I told myself I wouldn't read the manuscript, even though it was posted on Stephenie's website. That didn't last long, obviously. How could Inotread it, when it was available and calling out to me?So I read it. And... I loved it! No surprise there. It was refreshing to read things from Edward's perspective (ahhh, Edward!), and to be privy to his feelings as he realized that he was falling in love with Bella... as well as the danger being in love with her entailed. And some of the things he thought about Bella were so sweet and cheesy they made me swoon. :)Really good! I only wish the meadow scene had been written and included.
