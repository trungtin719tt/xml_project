White Oleander packs a powerful punch to your emotional psyche. Almost as soon as I started this book, I was swept away by the writing. Astrid Magnussan- just a beautiful wisp of a newly minted teenager watches as her mom spirals downward and loses control, ending up in prison. Astrid finds herself in Foster care and the story takes us on the path that soon defines Astrid's life. Home after home, fancy prostitues, starvation, to suicidal thoughts. This book does not shy away from the dark and gritty places. I was horrified yet found myself wanting more. I wanted to rescue Astrid from the delves of the barrel, and mostly from the poetic grasp of her mother.The writing was powerful-- I don't have the words to express how lyrical the writing was considering the dark subject matter. I found myself searching for hope and rooting for Astrid more than anything else, I just wanted her to be "Ok" by the end of the book. For me, the book was a little too lengthy in prose and may have made a bigger impact if some of the bulk was edited down a bit.
