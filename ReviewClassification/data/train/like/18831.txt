Garden Spellsis delightful and magical. It is the story of two sisters who are reunited, one of them returning home after leaving an abusive situation. Both sisters possess magical abilities.The characters are colorful. The romance is tender and romantic. I enjoyed the descriptions of baking and gardening and how the two intersect. The small town setting, the herbal potions and a magical apple tree only make the story more charming. It was resminiscent ofPractical Magic, yet more romantic and not quite as dark.The book is beautifully written. The author's prose is almost lyrical. Very impressive considering this is her debut novel. Just check out this excerpt:"Every smiley moon, without fail, Claire dreamed of her childhood. She always tried to stay awake those nights when the stars winked and the moon was just a cresting sliver smiling provocatively down at the world, the way pretty women on vintage billboards used to smile as they sold cigarettes and limeade."I've never read a book in the "magical realism" genre before and probably would not have bothered picking this one up if it hadn't come so highly recommended me to. Thank you, Kathrynn. It truly was "gentle" read!
