Stunning! This book is the perfect example of timing being everything. I tried to read this book when it was first released and I don't think I got passed the first 25 pages. I tried again after I saw the movie with the same outcome. Fast forward to 2016, the book obviously hasns't changed but I am a completely different reader and I LOVED this book. I'm pretty generous with 5 star reviews but I don't add many books to my favorites shelf which is where this one ended up. It is a slow burn and you have to be patient and take your time but the reward is so worth it. The story is beautiful and haunting and I am so glad that I kept trying and finally found the right time to read this.
