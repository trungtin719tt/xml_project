When a book defines a genreThere is nothing you can say anymore,That will add or detract from the volumes and volumesOf all that has been said before:So a book review I'm not attempting,Though the GR site is sorely tempting;Just paying my respects from the bottom of my heartAnd raising my hat to the Master of the Art.
