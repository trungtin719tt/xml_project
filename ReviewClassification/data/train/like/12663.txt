This is a book I picked up in Marlborough, NH, at a little used bookstore, also while on my New England vacation. I'd heard many people say how much they loved this book, so when I found it waiting for me on a step stool, I figured I'd take it with me.I guess it was a coincidence that "Any Bitter Thing" had so many Catholic themes while "My Name is Asher Lev" portrays the life of a Hasidic Jew who loves to paint. So, with that little sidenote, let me tell you what I thought of the book.I have to say that while I was charmed Chaim Potok's writing style, where everyone who's jewish seems to repeat what is said by another Jew, the message of the book is one I find hard to identify with. I found myself more aligned to Aryeh, Asher's father, than to Asher himself. Asher had this urge, I guess you could say, to paint, to study art, to learn about the artistic world that was very different from the world of Hasidism. He could not control it, and in the process he created magnificent art that unintentionally, but knowingly shocked and offended and hurt many of the people he loved. Now that is something I have a hard time understanding, so I'm a bit torn as to how to identify with the author's message. Asher had the chance to avoid causing this anguish, and you wonder if remaining uncompromising to what you think is necessary really justifies your actions.What I loved about the book was the explanation of artists' motives and personality, some of the history of art, the spirituality of Hasidic Jews, the devotion to the Torah of the Lev family, the author's imagery and use of emotion.The climax of the book is a tense, tense read, my friends. Not unlike the well-known train wreck you know is going to happen, but can't avoid watching. The last chapter of the book is fantastic.
