There is nothing romantic about Romeo &amp; Juliet. If anything, this felt like an intentional mockery to me. So if anyone thinks this is categorized as Romance, I will stare at them like they've lost their heads.There have been debates about whether or not Romeo &amp; Juliet is a satire. I'm 101% sure that this is a satirical play in which Shakespeare, the genius bastard, mocked and made fun of hot-headed, foolish teenagers. The man laughed in the face of insta-love (lust), and I laughed along with him. If he was here, I'd offer him a high five because hey, some of his mockery is true. Many teens (I'm not sayingall) tend to confuse lust and admiration for love. We also shoot our mouths like bullets at the adults who are supposed to 'know better'. I may or may not be one of those teens.I've read Hamlet, Macbeth, and Julius Caesar where characters there are smart in their actions. So... why would he create a fool like Romeo? I've read The Tempest where the relationship between Miranda and Ferdinand took a slow, budding pace so why the sudden proclaimations of love and wedding vows here? It does not adds up. Unless of course, you see this in a satirical point of view.Besides, Shakespeare always struck me as someone who explores in the deep meaning of love. Love is not a subject he took lightly. This I assumed also by judging from what many people say about his sonnets.I didn't feel the air of tragic when Shakespeare killed off the characters here; poison down Romeo's throat, sword in Juliet's gut. It felt like Shakespeare himself was laughing his ass off.Lookit these stupid teenagers. Lookit how blindly they throw themselves into relationships! Ha...ha...ha!So bugger with the insta-lust. It's laughable, unrealistic even, but I've had the time of my life reading this play. If Shakespeare indeed meant this to be a satire, he did a great job.
