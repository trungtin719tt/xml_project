"Open your minds, my friends. We all fear what we do not understand."'The Lost Symbol' is the 3rd book in the Robert Langdon series by Dan Brown. The writing style is kind of similar to that of the two preceding books. This one definitely was not up to that level of Angels and Demons and The Da Vinci Code because of many reasons like weaker writing, repetitiveness of dialogues, poor ending etc.However The Lost Symbol is still full of interesting historic facts linked to secrets and mysteries. Dan Brown's vast knowledge about history and arts helps him create a wonderful plot. This time all the action took place in the city of Washington DC and it was wonderful to learn how many secrets this city holds. I also enjoy trying solving the puzzles and mysteries in my mind along the story but I mostly failed.The book is also a great learning experience about the Freemasons and their believes, rituals and their society. Also Noetic Science was something new for me despite it being around for a long time.The villainMal'akhwas much better then the previous two villains. He outsmarted all of his enemies and even the CIA. At one point I was rooting for him to win. But the final revelation was kind of disappointing. One of the most anti-climactic and unsatisfying ending to the novel despite having a good starting and middle part.Will be looking forward to read the remaining books 'Inferno' and 'Origin' of the series soon.
