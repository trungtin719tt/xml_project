This was the first Vonnegut book I read, when I was 13. I chose it from the ones my mother had because, when scanning through, I noticed the little drawings. I am so grateful that those little drawings made me choose this book first. Since then, after reading many others, I know it was definitely the best to introduce me to the Vonnegut genre. It is lighthearted and funny, yet full of moments where the characters achieve great inner reflection, causing the reader to do the same. Vonnegut changed my life. Every time I finish a Vonnegut, I sit with it in my hands, pondering and examining my life. I thank him so much, and I wish I had had an opportunity to tell him face-to-face. If you are interested in reading Vonnegut, I definitely recommend this book for a beginning.
