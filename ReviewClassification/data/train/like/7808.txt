Artemis Fowl: Artemis Fowl, Book 1By Eoin ColferNarrated By Nathaniel ParkerI borrowed this book from the library. I figured everyone in the world has read this but me and thought I would catch up. What a hoot! Loved it! I don't know what I thought it was going to be but I didn't expect a 12 year old genius villain! My goodness, I thought it was great! The fairies, dwarves, trolls, and the silly things that happen, I giggled so much. It was so silly I can see why kids love this book. I am definitely going to read more. If my grandkids haven't read these I am going to tell them about it. Funny!!! The narrator was wonderful with all the variety of voices from the fairy girls to dwarves. Each different and interesting, wonderful job!
