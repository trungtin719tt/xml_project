What is about this book that haunts me? Is it the deep sense of emptiness? That the room stays the same, but objects move and light slowly fades into dark? That the narrator has no connection at all with the only other "human," the old lady whispering hush?Or is that that the narrator says goodnight to "nobody," that as we go outside her room, we see only stars - no people, no cities. It's as if this little bunny is the last one on earth, and is being watched by some robotic nanny bunny.I get the chills reading it, and I wonder if Cosette will pick up on it. She loves it too, but probably because of the red balloon and two kittens.Mmmm. Mush.
