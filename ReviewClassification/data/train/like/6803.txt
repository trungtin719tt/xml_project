I wasn't able to fully appreciate this book the first time I've read it. I thought I should give this novel a chance, thus I read this again to see if I will like this more on the second time. I didn't like it, but rather I love it! I could see myself on Ronnie's shoes at family matters only. And how I wish that I have someone like Will in my life too just like Ronnie.hahaha!
