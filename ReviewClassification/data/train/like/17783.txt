Fever is my all-time favorite UF series, so of course this casual reread with the MacHalos has caused me all kinds ofcrippling, nagging worriesandunending anxietyas usual.All these questions keep running through my mind -What if the series isn't as good as I remember?What if it's better than I remember and I spend the rest of my life in bed, rereading for eternity?What if a meteor crashes into KMM's house tomorrow and she never writes another word?Most worrying of all,what if I meet an actual, real-lifeV'lane/Mac shipper?!But so far, so good. We're already past book 2 and the unspeakable has yet to happen. Even though the breaks between installment BRs are of ungodly length and Mac is still on her way to becoming Mac 2.0, I'm hanging in there. Barely.
