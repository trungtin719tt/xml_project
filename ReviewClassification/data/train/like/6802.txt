Don't hesitate reading any of Nicholas Sparks books if you are a hopeless romantic...Ronnie - short for Veronica - is a troubled seventeen-year-old. Her parents divorced three years ago, and she hasn't spoken to, or seen her father since then. When she is forced to spend the summer with her dad in a small beach town in North Carolina, she is soon on the edge of `out-of-control'. However, over the weeks of the summer, she experiences her first love, and discovers things that change not only her outlook on life, but also her very existence. Her transformation from a rebellious, angry teen-ager into a responsible, sensitive, adult is heartwarming.
