Edit--re-read March 2013One of the best books I've ever read...still. In fact...The writing is very descriptive, lyrical and poetic. The metaphors (and there are a lot) are spot on-perfect. I highlighted s-o-o-o many passages, and they hit me every time I re-read them.The story itself is dark and often depressing in the examination of a young girl's relationship with her disturbed mother, and her subsequent journey through the foster care system. And though her mother is cruel, I swear she has some of the best lines (dialogue and in her letters)in the novel.White Oleander is not fluffy and light, it's not an easy read, but it's well worth checking out when you're in the mood for an emotional journey that is told beautifully.
