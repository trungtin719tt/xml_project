I read this book in two sittings. I know it is a little controversial: some people adore Rachel for 'stealing' her best friend Darcy's fiance. And some others think it is just immoral.Here goes my opinion. Rachel, who is a passive thirty years old woman, has lived in Darcy's shadow all her life. Darcy stole her first love Ethan (who now becomes Rach's best friend), her Notre Dame acceptance, her pride and even Rachel's own mother's sympathy. Darcy is not that evil, actually, she is self centered. Sometimes I really like Darcy for being so perfect. Sometimes I hate her for being so annoying.The truth is, all characters are flawed and personally, not likeable. However, they are all original and real, that's why I give 4 stars for this book. it is hard for an author to create a character that is not so adorable but real and nice to read. My favorite is Hillary and Ethan (I can picture Stanley Tucci acting as Ethan if this were made into a movie).Then there is this perfect (but not so perfect then) Dex Thaler. Dex is the handsome, patient, smart guy who is all perfect for Rachel. Only he never decides whether he wants Rachel or Darcy until the very end.Rachel herself is not a character I sympathize with. She is passive, she does not know what she wants, and she cannot stand up for herself. It is actually quite annoying to know that everything that happens to her is not all Darcy's selfish fault. It is her fault too, for not defending herself.However, I like the book! I like how the author creates twists and makes the story believable and in the end I'm happy for everyone :) bravo. Good Christmas read!
