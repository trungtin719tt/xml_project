4.5 starsTom Robbins captures my mind and imagination in his quirky, eccentric, bizarre, and outlandish story of a Princess and her love interest.I actually went to the dictionary to look up the word : Quirky. "Quirky" means lovable because of your faults, not in spite of them.The perfect word for this story.Tom Robbins is in a class all his own. His humor is closely related to Carl Hiassen, Tim Dorsey, John Kennedy Toole in his classic buffoonery, "A Confederacy of Dunces." (By the way, is my favorite novel of all times) and William Goldman's, The Princess Bride.It took me a long time to read this novel. I wanted to savor each and every word; every sentences is a story within itself.I think Still Life with Woodpecker, is a possible love it or hate it kind of read. I am definitely in the "LOVE it" circle.
