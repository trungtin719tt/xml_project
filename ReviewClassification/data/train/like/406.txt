Genre: Political SatirePublication Date: August 1945Love this book.This book is satiric and humourous. Orwell has depicted the political and civil issues of early Russia in a beautiful way.His writing is clever and makes the reader find himself very much engaged with the story and at times sympathetic towards the animals, only to realise that it is an allegory and all this had actually happened to people before and such misuse of power and trust still happen all around the world.
