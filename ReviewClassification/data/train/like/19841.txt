I enjoyedPushing the Limitsso much! It is such a sweet and emotional book. Actually my kind of book. I love troubled (but not angsty and annoying) main characters because it challenges me to dig deeper into their past and understand why they become what they are.The story centers onNoah Hutchins-- a guy who became an orphan at a very early age because of the accident that happened to his family several years ago, andEcho Emerson-- a girl who suffers a memory suppression because of the freaky incident that happened to her and her mom. Both of them share a couple of subjects together at school but they never had a chance to be good friends until their new clinical social workerMrs. Collinscame and partnered them for tutoring sessions.This book was full of emotions, but that wasn't the only thing that made me feel compelled to the book. It had a very entertaining start. There was humor and the characters instantly clicked the first time they collided. The chemistry was so good I can't help but sigh. I loveNoahm he's a perfect book boyfriend. I love the way he's protective towards her brothers and towardsEcho.Echois also one adorable character. Although she's vulnerable at the start, I admired her character development-- how she became tough in dealing her dilemmas. The secondary characters are also adorable.Isaiahis so cute and although I don't kind of connect withBethat the start, my feelings toward her changed at the last chapters of the book. And of course, I loveMrs. Collins. She's cool! Every guidance counselor should be like her!I just love this book! The only thing that kept me from rating it a perfect 5 was theromance. I love Noah and Echo's chemistry and their sizzling, make-out scenes but I was looking for more. The family drama was heavily emphasized in this book and I wish the author also made a great highlight in the romance because omg, they are perfect for each other.I want more Noah and Echo moments!!!But as a whole, it's a great and unforgettable read. It's my firstKatie McGarrybook and I'm impressed with her writing style. I'll definitely read more of her books!Rating: 4 Stars
