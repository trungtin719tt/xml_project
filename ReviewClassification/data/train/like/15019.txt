Random sale for $2.99 on US Kindle June 26, 2019.Fourth Read January 2018: 4 starsThird Read October 2015: 4 starsSecond Read November 2014: 5 starsFirst Read September 2014: 5 starsFour times and that ending still gets me! GAH! The only worse cliffhanger is the ending of the next book! But I can't wait for Book 4, Chapter 4! YAS.New thoughts:There are favorite scenes (they all include Barrons), but parts of this made me want to start skimming. I've never been a huge fan of the scenes with Jayne or V'Lane or the other sidhe-seers. I like Dani, but everyone else is just a drag and I hate Rowena. Thankfully, she isn't in this one too much.This is the one where Mac spends a lot of time with the "other characters." Where the supporting characters and overall plot gets fleshed out more. Sometimes, that isn't the most exciting to read (when you've read it four times and already know these little things). But some scenes still felt fresh and exciting. Best series ever, still!Our first annual re-read of the Fever series with theMacHalo groupstarts October 26, 2015! Here's the schedule (sorry, I can't keep to a schedule with this series - it takes over and I have to devour it once I start):Darkfever: October 26 / Bloodfever: November 9 / Faefever: November 23 / Dreamfever: December 7 / Shadowfever: December 21 / Iced: January 5 / Burned: January 12New Thoughts: Still really good, but I am taking away a star because I didn't quite like it as much as before. It reminds me a bit of Iced because most of it is about Mac's interactions with the sidhe-seers: Dani, Rowena, Kat, etc. Christian is in this a lot. A main theme is also Mac's mistrust of EVERYONE around her, esp. Barrons. This is her book where she thinks he is "the bad guy" and that's just not as interesting to me. :P Also, V'lane is in this one a lot, and I don't like him. The ending is spectacular and shocking. I just found myself skimming a lot of the middle. There was a lot of info-dumping which works if it's a first read. You need to know all of this. But, on a third read, I just wasn't feeling it as much.Second read review: This is book 3 in the (mis)adventures of MacKayla Lane, sidhe-seer, Null, and OOP detector. MacKayla is surrounded by evil fae and people she can't trust - or doesn't know if she can. There are people who seem like they might be trustworthy (Dani, Christian, Kat), some who seem highly iffy (Inspector Jayne, Rowena, V'Lane, Barrons), and some who are downright villains (the LM - Lord Master for short, Fiona, Derek O'Bannion). And this list gets shuffled around pretty frequently, except for a couple exceptions.The thing to remember is that hardly any time has passed since book 1 and things are changing and developing like CRAZY. Mac is evolving into a pro-active quick thinker and an intelligent woman the people around her shouldn't underestimate. She's still flawed and making (beginner) mistakes which is totally understandable, in my view.New thoughts about my second read of this book: I did notice some repetitiveness in the beginning and found myself wanting to skim through the sections of Mac's longer inner dialoguing. But overall, this was just as fabulous as the first time I read it.That ending is a doozy! Cliffhanger from hell.My mortal eyes just couldn't read the words fast enough in that action-packed maelstrom of a finale.original review:Ok, I'm officially in love with this series.Still have no idea what is going on with Barrons, but that's ok.And now the whole world has gone to unseelie hell in a hand-basket. Poor Mac. Crazy cliffhanger. Must go start reading the next one now.
