It's been some time since I read this book, but I picked it up again the other day and this time I like it better than I did before. I liked it a great deal on the first read, but now I love it. I've done a little research about the period since and I find the more the reader knows, the more you discover this book knows. Most of the time you reread a book to revisit how it made you feel. And this is true of this book. But you also reread this book to find another layer and another layer of profound meaning. This will probably become an annual read, especially when life gets complex and confusing and I need a good cry as well as a sense of revelation.
