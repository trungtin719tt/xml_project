Point of Retreat by Colleen HooverActual Rating: 4.85/5 StarsWhat a crazy, crazy ride this book was!Colleen Hoover really knows how to mess with our emotions, and have us wanting to cry and laugh at the same time.This woman really is a literary genius.I loved this book! Especially when part 2 hit, oh my gosh, that was insane, and so scary!!!I couldn't have asked for a more satisfying and beautiful ending for all of these amazing characters in this particular book, because the characters are one of the main incredible aspects of this book!If I haven't made it clear enough alreadyI butterflying LOVE these characters, every single one of themThe slam poetry was absolutely exquisite in this novel in particular, way better than in the first book, mainly because it was a lot more personal!The analogies that Hoover writes and brings to life within this story and these characters, I will never ever butterflying forget.Please pick up this series if you haven't already!
