Oh My Gosh...I recommend this book to 'ALL' my friends!This really 'is' a "CAN'T-PUT-DOWN-BOOK". My guess, is most people who start this book will keep reading until they finish-(one or two days tops)!Once you begin this book, you'll only STOP reading if you 'must' do something else in life. You'll pass on a favorite TV show. You'll pass on a walk. You'll pass on going to the movies or out to see a friend....UNTIL....You've finished reading "ME BEFORE YOU"LOVED IT!!!!elysep.s. I am 'forever' changed as how I will see people with major disabilities --[forever]!p.s.s. Here is a line in the book which had me laughing---and it was nice to laugh -- (the sentence is a little out of context without reading the entire book) ---but here it is anyway:"So...I'll go back and tell the Traynors that I'm going to get their suicidal quadriplegic son drunk, spend their money on strippers and lap dancers, and then trundle him off to the Disability Olympics--"
