This collection had three tales:The Telltale Heart,The Cask of Amontillado, andThe Black Cat.If you are unfamiliar with these classics, you should really read them. They are old-school horror, served chilled.They're all creepy as hell - Poe depicted narrators going completely mad better than just about anyone else, including florid ol' Lovecraft. This would be fine listening on a dark Halloween night.
