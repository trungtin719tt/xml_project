This review contains spoilers for earlier books in the series and mild spoilers for HUNTED.HUNTED is very much a "middle" book in the House of Night Series, a bridge between the first and second halves of Zoey's story. Zoey and her friends are hiding from the reincarnated fallen angel Kalona ad his evil Raven Mockers, as well as Neferet, who has become the Queen Tsi Sgili. Zoey will need to use all her power and lean on her friends if she means to defeat Kalona. But does she want to? She's been dreaming of him...To quote Zoey, "well, hell". For all of HUNTED, Zoey and company are between rocks and hard places, usually a wall or a creature of some sort.The trouble that came to light in UNTAMED comes to a peak in HUNTED, although there can be no doubt that the next four books are needed to finish the story. I think it might have been possible to finish the series here, although it would have been a longer novel then. And honestly, do we want it to end? No.I did feel a little overwhelmed by the sheer amount of characters and plot threads and built up gunk from the past four novels, but the end of HUNTED looks as though much of that will be wiped away.The writing is just as fresh and informed as ever, Kristin Cast's in-touch-ness with real teens showing through.Definitely a must read for fans of House of Night or vampire fiction in general.
