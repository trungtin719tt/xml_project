A kick in the head of a story. Fast and colorful and full of life both hilarious and tragic. Longfellow has a gift of putting you wherever she wants you to go. In this case, first you're in the middle of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and then you're in Chinatown, on top of Nob Hill, in newspaper offices, in dives and grand whorehouses. It's a great ride. Loved it!
