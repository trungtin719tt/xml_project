What a box set. This box set is totally worth the price. I absolutely love this series. If your a fan of YA, you'll love this series for sure. It's amazing. This isn't just another Twilight. Its even more mature and more attention holding than Twilight. I liked Twilight, but this is in a different category. This series has action, romance, twists and traders. I loved it more book one, and ever sine I couldn't stop. I cannot wait for Spirit Bound in May. It's going to be an amazing book. Richelle Mead is a genius. I love all her work. When a new book comes out from Mead, I know it's going to be awesome. If you have yet to read Richelle Mead book or this YA series, your in for a treat! Do it! Do it now! :D
