I finally get to cross this one off my TBR shelf - and I quite enjoyed it!! :)For being written in the 90s, this holds up pretty darn well. In a way, there may not be a whole lot of uniqueness going on - it's a cop murder mystery - but it flows quite well and kept my interest. I grew to like Eve, the police lieutenant, and Roarke, the roguish millionaire (billionaire?) who is more complicated and interesting than he first appears.I am definitely interested in continuing the series. It's only a tiny bit "sci-fi," as it takes place in the near-future (maybe 50 years from now). There isn't any techno babble and it's all on-planet. I would barely consider this sci-fi, actually.But it was an enjoyable read. Roarke is a sexy male lead and Eve grew on me.The subject matter of this one is pretty dark (sexual murders), but it isn't too graphic. The sex was steamy enough for me, but not smutty.I think this was an *excellent* example of a strong female character who wasn't written into a damsel in distress role. I appreciate that.Buddy read with theMacHalo group.
