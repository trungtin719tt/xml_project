A completely different book from this writer's other books. Lighter, frothier, funnier, faster - but just as well written and just as insightful. So colorful. So full of vivid scenes, times and characters. It takes place the year the president of the United States is paying a quick visit to San Francisco. Politics hasn't changed, crime hasn't changed, the nature of the rich hasn't changed. This is the solution (fanciful?) of what could have happened to Harding in Frisco told in the midst of wild action, conniving, bootlegging, earthquakes, hot jazz, a young city, and completely realized characters - especially Lizzie Stafford Hamilton, an Emma for our times. Terrific.
