So I have read this writer's other bookThe Secret Magdalenewhich is a great book. It is an important book. It brought me to this second book in which the writer comes at the idea of Consciousness in another way, through the mind of one of the most brilliant human beings who ever lived. No, it is not a man. It is a woman! And why do we not know this woman? Because men do not want us to know this woman, or any woman, could be like this. So they and their churches long ago threw her away like they would throw away anything that did not suit their world. In Hypatia's time, the church was growing fat on the minds and the hearts of the simple sad people who did not understand who they were. The poor people turned, as do they not always? to other men for the answers they could have found in their own hearts. But these answers would not satisfy those who require power and riches. Hypatia, because she lived in a man's world (do we not now?) had to be silenced. She was a philosopher, a mathematician, a cosmologist, an astronomer, a writer, an alchemist in the purest sense, a rider of horses, a sailor of boats, a wanderer, a teacher, what could she not do? She knew more, she was so much bigger, she shone so much brighter. They wanted to darken her light and they did. It broke my heart. What a writer this writer is to show us this woman in strong words that say so much. She says she will write one more book to go with these two wonders. I wait patiently in my little house.
