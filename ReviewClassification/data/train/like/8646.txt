THE EXORCIST is on quite a few of my favorite lists.I have read this book once before, and I own- and have watched the movie numerous times. This time I listened to the audio book.It is my favorite movie poster.It has one of my favorite "the making of" documentaries. It's in my top ten favorite movie list, and top five favorite horror movie list...and now that I have listened to the audio book. Favorite audio book...by far.William Blatty's voice is like butter...slathered on the perfect horror filled bagel with cream cheese.Georgetown, Washington:Chris MacNeil- an actress, and her young daughter- Regan- are living in Georgetown, while Chris is filming a movie. And everything is going along hunky dory until Regan starts playing around with the Ouija board from the attic.Regan starts receiving messages from Captain Howdy- who at first, Chris sees as a harmless invisible playmate..until frightening things start happening in Regan's room.After a party at the Georgetown home- Chris cannot ignore the fact that something horrible is going on in her house, and with her once so innocent daughter...and when a person close to her is killed- she knows she must do something drastic- and seek help from people she never would have dreamed of asking before.THE EXORCIST- I can't recommend it enough. The movie...the book, and now the audio book. Go!! Now!! Watch! Read! Listen! I beg of you.
