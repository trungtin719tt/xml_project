This book is an allegory of money or, at least, a parable on the theme of physical possession.All is symbol in this book, the pearl, object coveted by bead researchers, like money, sought by those who do not, are in the center.The story takes place in Mexican California, near the end of the peninsula. The protagonists are poor (as seems to me at Steinbeck) and one of them will find, so to say, the gem. I'll let you see what can happen to the poor who die of a magical stroke let fly fortune ... Think well in both senses of the word "fortune".For those interested, the story begins: Kino and his wife Juana are rough Indian, poor and workers, parents of a young child named Coyotito. This is stung by a scorpion and was between life and death. Juana understands that its traditional medicines may not be sufficient and convincing Kino to present it to in medicine of the white.The wealthy white doctor sends them wandering in seeing that it could not reasonably be paid. The couple goes off to, full of bitterness, almost resigned to losing her child. Before returning to work in order not to starve, Kino and Juana are going again dredging the bottom of the Gulf and discovered a huge gem, a huge bead, as they would not even dare to imagine, yet less possess.Although they want to hide it, the news spread like wildfire.From there, their fate is their own becoming, the white doctor, mysteriously, wants to see the child, Kino hears prowl at night around his hut...What to do when you are not on hand to play in the category of which money is the business? It is now for you to read and enjoy this beautiful new philosophical or sociological character, but remember that everything I just wrote is just my opinion, that is to say, not much thing.
