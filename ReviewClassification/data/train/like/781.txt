Maybe closer to 4.5 stars, but it's so sweet, who can do that to Anne? This was such a warm, welcoming read. It has very little friction, very little to keep your from melting into its prose and getting familiar with its characters. It is certainly a children's story and one from the 1900s, so it has its quirks and its strong morals and its lessons learned, but honestly, it was perfect weekday reading. This will be filed away under being regretful I didn't come to this as a child myself and also as reading for any future, hypothetical children.
