Aside from throwing light on lesser known post-war ramifications of the Nazi regime, this short, compact book surprised me with the number of moral, ethical and behavioral conundrums that it posed. These conundrums, if explored do not lead to answers but might lead to a sense of improved understanding - an understanding that is not limited to Nazi crimes, but can be applied to a whole host of mass crimes and post-war genocides where exploration isn't even an option. Bernhard Schlink's prose is spare and austere, not even a single sentence is wasted in building any unnecessary or irrelevant imagery or dialogue. So altogether the book does make a sound impact in the short time it takes one to read it.Couldn't resist watching the movie after reading it, and I'd say its one of those rare movies that are rendered from the book with remarkably high fidelity. And needless to say Kate Winslet aced it!
