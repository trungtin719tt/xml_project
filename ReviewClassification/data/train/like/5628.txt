We are the monster we fear.We are also the monster that induces fear in others, sometimes by an act as simple as turning a page.The reader is the author of meaning.Simply existing and acting causes ripples in the realities of others which we are incapable of comprehending.When you pick up a stone, the earth is lighter.When you turn the page, you are one moment closer to your own death.Not turning the page will not make the monster at the end of this book dissapear either, he will never go away.He is you.
