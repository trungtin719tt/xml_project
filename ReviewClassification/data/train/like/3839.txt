This was actually really nice. An uplifting tale, where the heroine wins out and the villain fails (screw you Miss Minchen!)Sara Crewe is a well off young lady, whose father sends her to a boarding school in London so she can be educated.Despite her upbringing being given her every hearts desire, Sara doesn't act like a brat. She shares what she has with the other girls - apart from two awful jealous ones. (There's always a vindictive girl and her sidekick).So when her father dies suddenly having lost their fortune Sara is reduced to a life of servitude and hunger.Despite this she pretends in her heart that she is a princess just going through hard times and that things will improve.It's a wonderful story with an ending that everyone would love. It restores faith in karma and good triumphing over bad. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
