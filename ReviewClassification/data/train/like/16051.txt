Oh, my silly love of teen vampire books. Melissa de la Cruz makes a fun world, easy to read, with characters that you love and hate. Full of all the angst and envy of a proper high school novel, but with the added bite of the supernatural.I'm charmed by Schuyler, the accidentally beautiful protagonist. She is endearing in her inability to fit in, which is something I'm sure many of us can relate to.The Force Twins. How can you help but love to hate Mimi Force? A girl who has everything, and knows that she really has been queen of the world.It's a fun, light read. It took me all of 4 or 5 hours, after which I promptly bought the next two books, which also took that long to read. Not as deep or detailed as they could have been, as I really, really wanted them to be. My Robert Jordan-primed brain wanted the two-page scenes to stretch out for chapters. Unfortunately, this is teen fiction, not overdrawn adult fantasy.It's excellent for what it is.
