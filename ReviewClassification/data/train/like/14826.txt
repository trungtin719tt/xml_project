The Story of Edgar Sawtelle is the type of book that seems to come along only once and a while. A book that provokes such varied reactions both mentally and emotionally within me is a rare book indeed. Yet somehow I both love the story of Edgar Sawtelle and hate it with a passion. Very few books disappoint me so completely as the story of Edger Sawtelle. Yet there are few books I admire more. The Story Of Edgar Sawtelle was an immensely annoying and irritating in it's vagueness, the disconnected series of events, a back story that only partially existed, and a series of characters that were immensely frustrating. The thing that really bothered me about Edgar was the fact that after reading a whole book about him I did not actually understand him as much as I would have expected from such a long book. The lack of motivation and justification for the actions and reactions of the characters within the novel was confusing and for me created a sense of confusion in reference to the back story. The plot was well done yet parts of it did not seem to fit together. The settings were undoubtedly superb and the mental imagery was second to none yet there was a vague sense surrounding the whole book. Parts of the book felt drastically out of proportion: large descriptions were given to the training of the dogs yet no reason was given for the disagrement between Edgar's father and uncle. The ending bothered me immensely: why did the dogs run away from the burning barn, did Edgar die, did Edgar's uncle leave the barn, what happened after the fire? This is a type of book that is incredibly powerful, profoundly tragic, and rare is a writer that can create a work that can compare to it. Highly recommended in every sense of the word.
