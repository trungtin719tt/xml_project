Wow! This is a masterpiece! DameAgatha Christie's achievement is remarkable. She creates ten characters, all suspected of murder, who are lured to an island. She has them meet their deaths one by one as nominated in the nursery rhyme"Ten Little Indians"which is displayed in their rooms. She has each murder occur in a situation where almost all the other island guests might have had opportunity to commit it.Set on an isolated island without contact of the outside civilization, a group of ten strangers are invited for a long weekend on Indian Island, a mile off the Devon coast. They include a doctor, a games mistress, a soldier of fortune, a rich playboy, a retired policeman, a judge, a spinster, a retired general and a married couple who are to be the servants. They arrive on a bleak rocky island to a completely modern house with all the amenities. The fires are welcoming, there is an ample supply of food, the servants are impeccable, but their host is absent. In each of the bedrooms, the"Ten Little Indians"nursery rhyme is posted on a prominent wall.It's a great book and is very scary with loads of suspense. A thriller that will definitely keep your pulse pounding. I love the setting on the island, with no phone or transportation. Just think, getting stuck on an island with a mad man. That sounds pretty creepy. This is my favourite book of all time!And Then There Were Noneprobably ranks among theBESTworks of crime fiction ever written.I highly recommend everyone to get a copy of this book :)
