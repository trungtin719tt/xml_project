You are an astronaut, the immensely able, Mark Watney, with a great, glamorous job, until stranded through a freak accident, on the desolate, airless, extremely cold, red deserts of Mars, in the mid 2030's, a powerful dust storm has apparently , killed...the five others in the crew, ( originally four men and two women, including the commander, Melissa Lewis) they barely escape , themselves, with their lives, up into orbit, in a small spacecraft, rejoining the massive, very expensive, Hermes vessel , on a long, sad voyage, of hundreds of days, back home to Earth, its ion engines slowly accelerating in limitless, merciless space, leaving their dead companion, behind, a shame , but nothing can change this fact, except that Mark is still alive...The lone, not badly wounded spaceman, regains consciousness, sees a frightening sight...he's all alone on the vast planet, and says, I'm pretty much screwed, ( admittedly, not an exact translation) the castaway, repeats this frequently, in the story. Abandoned by his friends, little hope to survive, 31 days of supplies left, either starve or run out of air, no more communications with NASA, possible, slowly waiting to die...but Watney will not lay down and expire gently into the night, darkness will be postponed, for now, as his fertile, brilliant mind, keeps working, after all, he's the fix it man, a mechanical engineer , nothing will faze him, Mark, with his rather macabre , sense of humor, wishes it were true. Planting potatoes in his "Hab", he's a botanist too, ( the best on this planet, as he jokes) growing them, a big harvest, and yet soon loathing, how many can you eat, without vomiting... Making water and air, repairing anything he views, (leaks are fatal here ) especially the Mars Rover, so he can transverse the eerie, lonely, empty, nevertheless, quite fascinating, and attractive, sandy, landscape, with dangerous, broad craters...exploring , in complete stillness, makes for an uneasy journey, no sounds either... find what will be useful, his goal, Pathfinder, many thousands of miles from his Martian base . This ancient, robot craft, an old relic, is found miraculously, though, now communication with Earth and NASA , ( they knew earlier, by the orbiting satellites, he was still alive) can be reestablishes, at last...navigating by the tiny, strange, nearby Martian moons and stars above, the helpful clear, brownish skies, at night, keeping constantly busy, the next scheduled spaceship, back here, by the American space agency, brings him, depression... four years away...grim Mark thinks...Disaster follows disaster, anything that can, will break, mistakes are made by the intrepid , but somewhat clumsy spaceman, yet Watney can never succumb, until he breathes his last mouthful of air. Deep inside his intelligent brain, something occurs, hope...One of the greatest , most entertaining science -fiction books, ever written, for any reader who wants to travel to another time and exotic place, be thoroughly mesmerized, turn the next page and discover the continuing adventures of a man who never quits. Required reading by new NASA astronauts, the American Space Agency , loved this novel, so did I. ....P.S. the film is magnificent also...thank you, Robinson Crusoe
