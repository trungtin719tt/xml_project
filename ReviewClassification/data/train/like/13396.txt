I didn't know what the plot was for most of the book, but fortunately I adore Cashore's world and characters. The (few) parts about Leck's past were the most interesting to me. I have enjoyed in both Fire and Graceling how Cashore writes budding romance. I like her lead heroines. I like that she frequently mentions menstruation and includes disabilities.Representation:One side character uses a wheelchair. Fire sustains an injury that temporarily disables her hands. Fire has depression at one point. There is a passing reference to her being bisexual.Potential triggers:Violence, death, murder, injury. Fire's first love interest is jealous and controlling. Honestly, I know I've overlooked some but I have a hard time keeping track with war stories like this.
