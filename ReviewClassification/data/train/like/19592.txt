How can I reasonably be expected to review a book which, over a space of some forty-five years, has become central to my existence? Ever since I was first introduced toJorge Luis Borgesin aNew Yorkerreview around 1969-70, whenLabyrinths: Selected Stories and Other WritingsandFiccioneswere first published in the United States.Since then, I have been following Borges's leads, which have led to to visit Iceland and Argentina (twice each), to read G.K. Chesterton's essays and fictions, to look at American literature with new eyes, to re-evaluate Robert Louis Stevenson and Rudyard Kipling.Labyrinthsis the fruit of Borges's apogee in the 1930s and 1940s. By the 1950s, he was more or less a spent force who, like his father, was going blind. Most of the book is taken up with his short fictions, including the best known ones, such as "Tlon Uqbar Orbis Tertius," "Death and the Compass," "Funes the Memorious," and "The Library of Babel." Following are some essays, which are hard to understand for most readers -- especially "A New Refutation of Time," ending with some short (and brilliant) parables and an excellent poem.If I were still a young man starting out in life, I would have done the same thing upon reading this book. Still, at least once a day, some epiphany based on the author's observations, elbows its way into my consciousness, leaving me breathless.
