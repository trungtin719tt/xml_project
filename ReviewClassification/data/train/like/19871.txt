What a marvelous read. I'd forgotten how endearing the stories are told by the English countryside vet. Lots of rural humor and fascinating insights are offered about the farm animal and small pets world. I liked the bucolic descriptions of the small towns and rural countryside. I hope to return to continuing the series.
