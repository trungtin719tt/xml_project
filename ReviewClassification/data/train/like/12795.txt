I feel like every time I love a YA book I start my review with "I don't read a lot of YA, but..."So, I don't read a lot of... I mean... Hang on...Patrick Ness is the best YA author out there. If you haven't read the Chaos Walking trilogy then please put everything in your life on hold and go find a copy of The Knife of Never Letting Go. This is the only book I've read from him outside of that series, but this book is just as amazing. I would also recommend picking up a physical copy of the book because the illustrations and the entire presentation in real book format with real pages made from real trees just makes the entire experience that much better.I decided to read this after I watched the trailer for the movie that comes out later this year. The movie looked really good, I recognized the author, one thing led to another, yada yada yada, and I finished the book in one sitting. Then I put everything else by Ness on hold at my library. Then I put everything I could find by Siobhan Dowd on hold at my library.So I don't read a lot of YA, but I do. And this book raises the bar on the genre. It's like what Neil Gaiman tries to do with fantasy on a whole nother level mixed with John Green's tear-jerking coming-of-age stuff. It's short and there aren't any wasted words or pages. It begins and ends beautifully with fantastic stories within the story.I'm so glad a ran across this thing and took the time to read it. It tackles some pretty heavy issues in a unique way, andit's something I feel like I'll be thinking about for a while.Patrick Ness, man. He owns YA fiction in my opinion.
