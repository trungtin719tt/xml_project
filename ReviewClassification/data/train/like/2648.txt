Re-Read in December 2015 for Harry Christmas to YouThis time around I realized how much more entertaining this book is compared to the movie. Nothing against the movie because I LOVE it, but this book has so many more fun scenes! Like Arthur and Lucius PHYSICALLY FIGHTING EACH OTHER and Dobby tossing Lucius down a flight of stairs at the end. Reading this aloud with Kyle literally had us laughing like crazy. I love this series so much oh my Rowling.Re-Read in December 2014 for Harry Christmas to YouOH MY LORD VOLDEMORT.In this book we get more little hints to events to come in future books (Horcrux stuff, a mention of Voldemort having left a part of himself/his powers in Harry, etc.) WHICH WAS AWESOME. I find that every time I read these books I notice more things, which was definitely true this time around.One thing I did notice, which COULD HAVE SOLVED EVERYTHING:At the beginning of the book when they're leaving for King's Cross, Ginny forgets her diary and has to back for it. SHE NEARLY LEFT IT BEHIND. OH MAN.Overall, this was a great time, but I'm excited to finally get to my favorite books in the series!!!
