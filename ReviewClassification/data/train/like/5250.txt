Let's face it, John Milton was a closet devil-worshiper. Satan here is presented so sympathetically it's hard to think otherwise. He has the best lines, and even his actions would be laudable by most Christian standards (excepting, of course, starting a war in heaven). He never gives up, he fights for what he believes in, he's really clever, and he even pities humans for having to be his tools to get back at God. The good angels come off as such sissies and are always really smug and self-satisfied and say things like, "Yeah Satan, I know you're a lot better than me at everything, but remember my dad is God and if you hit me he's going to kick your ass." Gabriel and Michael are real assholes, and it makes me feel sad that Satan doesn't whip up on them some more.This book is incredibly awesome but a litle dense. It's super sweet and kick ass but you have to sit down and really spend some time with it, and you'll have to read it pretty slow. I've never understod blank verse so I just read it like prose.
