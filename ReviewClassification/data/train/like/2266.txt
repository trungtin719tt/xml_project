Looking for Alaskais my second John Green book. Even though it was very different than TFiOS, it was still emotional, moving and just quirky enough to make me smile and laugh.Miles Halter's moves to Alabama to go to boarding school. This is his big adventure. A chance to make some friends, live a life bigger than the one he's been living in Florida. On his first day there, he becomes friends with his roommate, my favorite and most memorable character, Chip aka the Colonel. He also meets a girl that enamors him. Alaska Young.This is one of those stories that is so difficult to summarize/review. What I can say is that John Green's characters are relatable and easy to love. There are so many great quotes and moments in this story. It's one I very much enjoyed listening to.Love, friendship, life, death, before, after, finding meaning in life and learning to forgive. That is whatLooking for Alaskais all about.
