If you love Jewish/Israeli History. If you like reading about the crimes committed and the heroics performed during the Holocaust. If you like to read about Zionism and How Countries of the world effected or hindered the establishment of a Jewish State. And last but not least, and you want this to be a novel, which is historically accurate, look no further, this is the book to read. I truly loved reading this book, I couldn't hardly put it down. It was so easy to read, I became a part of the Story and emotionally lived the story, I could feel and even smell what the characters were going through. This is the story of the Holocaust and the struggles of the Jewish people to establish the state of Israel in an Arab and British controlled Palestine. This is also the story of how all these events played in the lives of Ari Ben Canaan (whose Character was based on the real life Yossi Harel) who was the architect of Smuggling of Jews into Palestine, and Using the Ship the Exodus, With 300 Children as a way to bring the attention to the world on the struggles of the Jews of Palestine and the immoral and inhumane treatment of the Jewish holocaust victims trying to immigrate to Palestine at the hands of the British. Kitty Fremont, a Christian Nurse from America, trying to make sense of the loss of her husband in WW II, and their only daughter who died a few months later. She finally finds what she needs in the person of Karen who was looking for her parents, and Dov, a youth filled with hate and revenge, living through the holocaust from the Warsaw Ghetto. all of the historical characters and events are here. this a must read book, and for me a life changing event.
