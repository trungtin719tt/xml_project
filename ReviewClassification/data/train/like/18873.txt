I was not expecting too much, and was rewarded with a pleasantly surprising read. You can fly through this book in just a few hours, but why should you...? Here's why: Haddix creates a charming, star-crossed protagonist living in a dystopian society as a Shadow Child. Families are only allowed two kids. Luke is the third child to a strapped farming couple living on the edge of civilization. For most of his life, Luke's had the run of the back forty, but when a new housing development bring wealthy homes to their neck of the woods, Luke is forced to stay in the attic. He may never go outside again.Luke watches the new neighborhood from his secret attic lookout. One day he notices a blind flutter on one of the extravagant homes. Without his parents' knowledge, Luke sneaks over to the new neighborhood and meets another shadow child--a girl! She's linked into an underground network of Shadow Children. Adventures follow. Not too racy for your 6th grade nephew, yet deep enough for a high school ethics seminar (is there such a thing?.
