I don't know how Irving does it. Again, in this book nothing spectacular happens. We just follow some very human characters in their everyday lives, with all its ups and downs, with its beautiful sides as well as its sad ones. But I just loved to read this, mainly because I cared for the characters. Most of them are so kind and warm, they have so lovable quirks and their passion sometimes leads them to make stupid mistakes. It's easy to connect with them and in my opinion, that is the particular beauty of this story.
