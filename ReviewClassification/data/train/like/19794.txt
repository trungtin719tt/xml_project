OMG!!!I remember reading this book years ago!!!! Oh wow this brings back memory.This book right here is what opened me up to the thrilling rush of angst, crime and deception!! No joke!! I use to rarely read to begin with. When i saw this book laying around, literally covered in dusk, i took it up, read the first page n didnt pick it back up for months!! I don't remember why I was pulled to it then but i was!Tracy was it? She was a strong willed woman!! OMG I love how she went thru SO MUCH and didn't break... and who doesn't love it when a woman gets revenge on people who did her wrong?? I felt it for her with every step of her journy. From in the court room, to in jail... right down to when she made a notorious name for herself. I felt it all, i screamed in frustration, cried at her loss and her situation, laughed with relieve... I swear my emotions where on high with this book and I. Loved. EVERY. Second!And on top of that, the rush of fast life, the wittinesss and the fast pace/risky jobs at hand... all bestowed on a WOMAN...!! MAN... I love it - i LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!Running across this book brings back memory.I use to only read popular books, and even then, i had to like said popular books so the quantity of books I read was minimized...Gosh, I love this book so much because I feel like it was the window that opened me to both writing and reading constantly until they not only became an activity, but pure love and literally my way of life.MUST READ!!!
