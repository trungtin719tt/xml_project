I loved the supernatural romance between Ever and Damen. They might just be my new favorite fictional couple.Beside Ever's supremely stubborn side, I liked her. You got a real understanding for why she is so stand offish, why she's closed herself off from the world.Damen is a mystery. His hot and cold attitude (towards Ever) was frustrating yet, very intriguing. Wanting to put the pieces of the puzzle together is what kept me wanting more.I loved Riley, Ever's sister. Riley is unable to move on, out of fear that her sister needs her around. As she struggles with crossing over or staying with Ever ... Ever struggles with doing the right thing and letting Riley go.There are definite similarities to Stephenie Meyer's Twilight series but, this is it's own amazing story. This is not a Twilight clone. I'll probably upset some Edward fans but ... I'm a bigger fan of Damen.August 2009 is the release for the second installment, Blue Moon. August can't come soon enough.Would I recommend? Definitely yes. In fact I've already started lending my book out.
