It's hard to describe just how magical my first reading of The Lord of the Rings was. I was 'in the book' from the very first page &amp; have rarely - if ever since - been so immersed. I didn't just want to read about Hobbiton, I wanted to live there. It is a truly beautiful story which is imbued with a love for language and nature, a story of heroism in the face of terrifying odds. The characters: Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, Gollum &amp; others have stayed with me for the twenty-five years since. Whenever I take a walk through a particularly pleasant part of England I am reminded of this book. Every fantasy fan should read this book, it really does deserve all the praise it receives.
