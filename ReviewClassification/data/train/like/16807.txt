Save one of the best for the last of my summer reviews. I love Peller's "To Live" books, and this one, though a departure from the other two, is in my opinion the best one yet. Shawn Michals is still finding himself, but now he's being led by an exotic woman named Bina who wants him to lead a revolution. All the while this story is being told in a "fantasyland" that greatly resembles what we as a world are currently experiencing. This rocked my world.
