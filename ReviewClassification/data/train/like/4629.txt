I kind of spoiled it for myself by reading most of this over the course of a few days. I think it definitely gets better when you take a break from it and come back to every now and then.It's a comic strip. I'm not going to talk about story arcs or character development. There is none. Calvin is six years old for ten years straight. He doesn't change, he doesn't learn anything new, and honestly I wouldn't want him to.The art is beautiful. You get a lot of full page spreads, great use of panels and although Watterson drew the whole thing, there's some interesting variety in art style that's always good to see occasionaly so it doesn't get too samey.There's a lot of reused material in these comics. It does get exceptionally repetitive story-wise, but that's the essence of a strip comic. It's also exacerbated when you read ten years worth of material in a couple of weeks. That doesn't take away too much from how good it is.This comic is so many things, philosophical, realistic, idealistic, optimistic, immature, wise, and silly. Above all else, this comic is honest. I've never seen so many topics approached with so much honesty, and I wouldn't have expected that from a strip comic. Same thing with the philosophical elements of this comic. It can be deep, insanely deep for literally three panels.I give this a solid 5 stars but if I would probably recommend one of the abridged versions. You would probably lose out on all the weather related strips, hopefully all of the Spaceman Spiff stuff and repeated/almost duplicate panels, which would only make you enjoy the best of the collection that much more. I got kind of tired of Calvin getting attacked by Hobbes as he gets home from school the 50th time it happened and I wouldn't recommend that to anybody.A fun, surprisingly deep read. Recommended to people who like philosophy, comic strips, humour, and people with short attention spans.
