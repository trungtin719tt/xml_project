It was awesome! I love the story, I love the camp, I love the characters, I love everything about it!!Derek, Lucas, and Perry... them my favs ^-^Here are some quotes (yes, I perfer them in my reviw, dont judge (Ps. These may or may not be spoilers))..."'They call us boneheads,' the girl said...'Ha,' said the blond boy. 'They also call us boners.'A few laughs echoed from the toher seats. 'Why is that funny?' the girl wearing all black asked in a tone so deadly serious that Kylie shivered.'You dont know what a boner is?' Blond Boy asked. 'If you'll come sit beside me, I'll show you'" (21)."...Slowly the sparkles fell to the floor and left standing where Perry has once stood was a huge honking white unicorn with a pink horn in the middle of its forehead...'Shit!''Damn!''Oh my god!''Holy cow!''Mo fo'"(48/49)!"'Then we don't ask him to let us in. We sneak in.''Sneak by a vampire? That's like trying to fool Superman.''Yeah, but I happen to know what his kryptonite is.''He has a kryptonite?' Derek asked.'Yup. And her name is Holiday'" (357).
