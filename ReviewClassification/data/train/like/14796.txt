My sister gave me her copy of this book in a big sack of books and snacks and magazines the morning my husband and I set out to drive across the country, moving to Delaware from Utah. I started out reading it silently to myself, but after a chapter or so I had to start reading it aloud to my husband. The writing was so gorgeous, so tender and deeply felt, that I couldn't not share it. Even now, almost seventeen years later, I can remember entire passages word for word. I'm pretty sure I could tell you each episode of the book, in order. There's no plot here, it's a series of episodes or vignettes in the life of young Huw, growing up in a mining town in Wales. His family, his friends, are all here, painted with loving clarity. Such a beautiful book . . . now that I'm writing this I think I need to get my own copy and reread it. I kept my sister's copy for years, and would occasionally take it down to read a page or two.
