I have read this book twice. My daughter Emily has read it at least four times. One day when she was about 14 I asked her why she loved this book so much. She said, "I want a life just like Corrie Ten Boom." I said in a searching surprised voice, "You want to be sent to a concentration camp?" She said, "No mom, duh, I want to be that kind of person. I want to have that kind of faith."This is an amazingly inspiring book. I think often of the lessons I learned from it. Getting the ticket (of strength) just before you get on the train, being grateful for miracles even in the worst of circumstances and having the courage to help others even if you have to place yourself at risk are a few examples. And, I never contemplate forgiveness that I don't see Corrie in my mind.If you haven't read this wonderful book yet. I highly recommend it. If you have already read it you'll know, it's worth reading again and again.
