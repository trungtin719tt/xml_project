29/4/2017The last time that I read this, I gave it five stars. And, like, I still love this book. But LOLOLOLOL it's not even CLOSE to being a five star book by my current standards.Anyway. It's a solid ending to the series. I love seeing Chloe realise that her powers are way more badass than most necromancers. I love seeing Derek struggle with transforming for the first time, with his feelings for Chloe, with SIMON'S feelings for Chloe, and with having to go up against adult werewolves who know what they're doing. And it IS still my favourite book of the trilogy.That said, it does all wrap up a little neatly (while also not giving us ANY ANSWERS AT ALL about what happens to Rae). So.1/1/2012This is my favourite of the trilogy. Again, I read it in a couple of hours today. I love the growing relationship between Chloe and Derek, as well as the passive inclusion of The Pack, and the mutts that turn up in Frostbitten. After spending so much time reading about Clay and how certain he is of himself, it's nice to see a male wolf who's just coming into his powers and isn't entirely sure about who he is and how the world is going to treat him.While I always finish the book wanting to know what happens to Rae, it's written in such a way that there's scope for another book/trilogy further down the track!
