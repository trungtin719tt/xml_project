UPDATE ON THE TV SERIES 8/14/2013: I gave up. I've been watching on Amazon Prime because I hate commercials. But not even Mike Vogel/Barbie's pretty face can make me overlook more of the filmmaking infelicities of the show. I didn't expect the book on screen. I did expect the show to follow the rules of TV storytelling and not just dump plotlines they set up. Not for me.UPDATE ON THE TV SERIES 6/24/2013 in 5sec: cute boys, dirty pols, meanass bitches = weeks of fun! Junior is perfect, sociopathic little shit; Barbie is too young and too pretty, thank GOODNESS, to be true to the book; and the amount of writing talent is adequate to the task, but no more than that.YET MORE INFO: The trade paper edition of this doorstopper is out. It's $19.99! Remember when that was a hardcover book's top price? My review is also atExpendable Mudge Muses Aloud.Rating: 4.25* of fiveThe Book Report: Chester's Mills, Maine, is having itself an ordinary morning, and its citizens are gettin' up to all the usual things: Spending too much of their husband's money, killing girls, beating up people they don't like and driving them out of town, making evil brews, only thing missing really is a bonfire and a faggot. Business as usual for the human race, in other words.*WHAM*Down comes the Dome.No way in, no way out, no one can understand the nature, the origin, or the purpose of the Dome inside or outside of it. National security issues crop up. The town misfit, an Iraqi war vet, is called back into national service to solve the mystery. And then things get **really** ugly: The local used car salesman takes control.Think Nixon with a mean streak and a Big Fat Secret to protect."From Bad to Worse" could be the subtitle of every Stephen King novel, but this time it's so so so so bad and then it gets so so so much worse that the reader is calling out to Divine Providence for the mercy of Death...and then comes The Twist. The Dome is revealed to be...but no, you have to read it.My Review: Stephen King = what Chuckles the Dick would've been if he'd had talent.Just sayin'.I hated liking this book. I resented the demands on my gouty wrists and fingers, supporting its mammoth weight, flipping the pages faster and faster and faster as I got more and more sucked in to the story. I snorted snobbily at myself, caught up in this not-terribly-sophisticated narrative. None of which stopped me finishing the book and sighing with mitigated contentment at its sudsy, gloriously cinematically trajectory. I can see the miniseries...I want to see the miniseries! soon please!...unfold in my mind. It's what Stephen King does brilliantly: Tells you a story of human nature, irrefutably making points that need making about Mankind and its flaws, while wringing your withers with fear, excitement, and sadness.The Dome was a really cool narrative device. I liked its unknowability, I was completely on board with mystery forces causing it who-knows-why...and then we find out why. I wasn't especially interested in that part, and felt it was a tidge unimaginitive coming from Mr. Shock-and-Awe himself.Eh...so what...I had over 1000pp of reading pleasure. It's like potato-chip sex. The kind you have because you can. It still feels good, and no way are you gonna stop just because it's meaningless.(I suppose this last isn't comprehensible to my girly readers of either gender.)Relax. Enjoy. Don't think too much. You'll end up in a much better mood than you started out in.This work is licensed under aCreative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
