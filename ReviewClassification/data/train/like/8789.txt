I'm a part of the atheist choir to which Dawkins is preaching; but I honestly believe that this book might change a religious person's mind, if they bothered to pick it up (I've been hearing a lot about how many religious congregations are condemning Dawkins's work as a tool of Satan). It's full of scientific goodness, and refutations of common defenses of religion and attacks upon atheism. Suddenly, I don't feel so alone.It's well known how many horrors are perpetrated in the name of religion, but Dawkins manages to unearth a few more of which I'd never heard. There's also a great chapter on the many hypocrisies of the Bible - and there are plenty more than what I'd even been using in prior arguments with religious friends.
