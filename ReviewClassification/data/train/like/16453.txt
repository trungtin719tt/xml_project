This is the best epic novel I ever read. It's an historical adventure/romance that takes place in colonial India. The book starts out when the protagonist, a young English boy named Ash is orphaned because of a cholera outbreak. He is then raised by an Indian nursemaid. Later as a young man he falls in love with a young woman, Anjuli, who has been promised to marry an elderly wealthy nobleman against her will. Her wicked stepmother selected the old man out of spite knowing he would die soon. Custom dictated Anjuli would be burned alive on his funeral pier at his death. Thirty years later I still think of these characters I came to love so much sometimes. It's a beautifully written novel, and also a page-turner-- never drags-- and I learned a lot about India too.
