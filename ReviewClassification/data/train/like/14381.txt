Beautiful, beautiful book.I absolutely loved the descriptions of the Smoky Mt. area and the people. It was wonderful to know more of their heritage and what contributed to their stubborness, their 'clan' loyalty and their work ethic.Marshall is such a GOOD storyteller. The characters and conflicts were so real. The school children were a delight to read about. I can't even begin to understand how she handled 70+- kids in a one-room school. Amazing.It's no surprise people fell in love with Christy. I certainly did. I love reading (this may sound twisted) of people's flaws and how they grow and sometimes overcome them, but more often just come to understand them and gain a different perspective. i.e. her sensitive nose: that never really went away, but she was able to not be as bothered by it because of her new perspective and feelings towards the people and the situation.I love love love the ending.
