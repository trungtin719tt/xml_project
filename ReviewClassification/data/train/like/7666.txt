3.5 stars.I realized about halfway through the book that Rob Fleming is basically me in dude form, which is probably why I found him so insufferable. That says more about me than it does about this book, but there you have it.I quite enjoyed this story of a mid-30s dude who loses the relationship that has kept him grounded for years. Who are we if we are not the reflection we get back from others? He didn't like what he saw, so cue the big life questions with a lot of self-loathing hidden under a thin veneer of arrogance and humor. Throw in a lot of "Top 5" lists, and this is me in a nutshell not too many years ago. I would like to take this opportunity to apologize profusely to everyone who had to deal with me, because Rob Fleming made me throw down the book in anger and frustration more than once. I get it now.I think most of us go through stages exactly like this, though. The story was well done, funny, sentimental, empowering in parts, and eye-opening to those of us who have been there.
