Reading this book was quite possibly the only good thing that happened to me in the year 1995. I've since re-read it in its entireity another four or five times, and skimmed through it and picked out my favorite passages at least a dozen times. It's a beautiful "sweeping epic" set in British colonial India, the story of "Ash", who spends the first part of his life believing he's the son of a Hindu serving woman in the palace of a rajah and is himself enlisted as a personal servant/favorite playmate of the young prince. He later discovers he is actually the son of English gentry, and is sent "back" to England (though he was born in India) to attend posh prep schools and receive a proper education so that he can follow in his father's footsteps and be commisioned into the Royal Army, where, of course, his first assignment is to return to India. I love all the palace intrigue and politics, and the juxtaposition of Eastern and Western cultures and ideals, and the ways Ash is depicted searching to make meaning of his identity and his spiritual and personal beliefs. There's a love story, too, and although it is deeply satisfying, I find it almost secondary to the rest of the story.
