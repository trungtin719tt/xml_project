I decided to squeeze this in to my year of Alaska and Canada reading. This might be Jon Krakauer at his best, because he has a personal connection to the story of Chris McCandless and his fatal trek into the Alaskan wilderness. He lets the facts speak for themselves and is deeply respectful of all involved. He doesn't glorify Chris/Alex as many do, but he also doesn't dismiss him as an idiot. He really probes into what drove him, and what has driven others who have died in various wildernesses. I appreciated the inclusion of quotations from the books Chris was reading.Several people have pointed out that there is a book written by Chris McCandless's sister Carine (The Wild Truth), and that looks worthwhile, although I don't think I'll get to it in 2018.There is apretty great sitewith photos and other accounts kept maintained by his family and the foundation they started.
