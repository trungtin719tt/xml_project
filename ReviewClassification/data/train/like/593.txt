You stand in a line for an hour to get on the roller coaster that everyone has told you about. The one roller coaster that everyone says you'll love and will want to ride again. But, you look at it and think: "I've been on this ride before. There's nothing new to this. Is it really going to be worth my time?" You finally get to the front of the line and you're buckled in. Once the ride starts, you begin to think: "This is much taller than it looked from the ground". You reach the crest of the hill...and you never stop screaming.Reading the classics is not something I do, regularly, especially since I can no longer see school from my rearview mirror. But, I have to say,The Picture of Dorian Graytruly WOWED me!!! Both the message and characters are timeless. We start on the path of innocence and naivete' and end in the chasm of sin and debauchery.In the words of Samuel Butler, "The truest characters of ignorance are vanity and pride and arrogrance".
