This was very cute and quiet a bit longer than expected, but a fun and nice read overall.I never knew about this book series as a child -be it because i didn't grow up in an english speaking country or because my childhood books of this age group where mostly Astrid Lindgren books- but i can defiantly see why its is such a beloved series.Its just nice to see a book about very simple but lovely things.About family and love and helping each other out, no added drama or sad moments that seem completely unnecessary.its just a cute little story that is defiantly worth a read if you enjoy softer books that don't have a lot of things happening but what is happening is fun and entertaining and most of all lovely to read about.I can completely understand the love and adoration so many people have when talking about this series!
