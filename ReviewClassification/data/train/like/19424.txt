THIS BOOK WAS AMAZING AND PERFECT!! It was soooo inspirational! &lt;3Melody is an OUTSTANDING, INTELLGENT, and KIND fictional character that I absolutely LOVED!! I love everything about Melody and learning more about her life and the difficulties she has to face made me respect her more. Melody is such a strong and powerful character that has really influenced me and hit me right in the heart!!I HATED most of the her inclusion classmates! They are so cruel and I wanted to punch Claire, Molly, and Rose in the face at times! It seems that normal people are so cruel while ones with disabilities have been through so much that they are generous and forgiving of one another. I wish everyone was like H-5's students because they all rock!!"Out of My Mind" made me tear up near the end! Only a few books are able to do that! I could actually feel the pain Melody had to put up with her crappy ass teacher and shit peers. MELODY FOR THE WIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!This book was just PURE AMAZINGNESS!!! I loved every little detail and read the words with hunger for more!!!!!! LOVELOVELOVE! &lt;3If I encounter someone with disabilities I will say HELLO to them, smile, act normal around them and NOT pity them. They are normal too! And I think many people need to open their eyes in order to see that. (Or read this phenomenal book! Haha!)(:
