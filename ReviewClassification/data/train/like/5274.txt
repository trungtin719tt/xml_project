I think it's probably the best book about kindness I have read. It's about people so truly kind, so very gentle (not to be confused with humble), that you amazingly feel like a better person yourself. It kinda gives you hope in humanity.The book portrays the world that is definitely not a very good place: it's cruel, it's lonesome, it's messy, bloody, and unjust, and you have no right to choose, and you have very few opportunities, and everyone is either an orphan or a deeply unlucky man, but in this stupid, unfair world kind, self-effacing people like Dr Larch and Homer Wells somehow manage to bring glory. The most honorable thing about their self-sacrifice is that it feels completely natural. Seems like they're just doing their duty, and they stay where they are simply because they belong there (this feeling of belonging in the book is outstanding.) This is a book about those incredible people who serve the mankind, without remorse or resentment, with dignity and love, lots of love.And no, despite this noble message, it's not like the Bible: there are some pretty gruesome details and extremely naturalistic descriptions which could make a lady faint, but it's witty and extremely readable, and rereadable, and giveable to all your friends.Highly recommended.
