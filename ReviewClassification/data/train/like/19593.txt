The BBC, in declaring Borges the most important writer of the 20th century, declares "reading the work of Jorge Luis Borges for the first time is like discovering a new letter in the alphabet, or a new note in the musical scale."Thatis a vast understatement. Reading Borges is like discovering an entirely new dimension of experience, it is like having all of your neurons plucked out and rearranged in unfamiliar configurations, it is like attuning to a new form of perception, it is like being suspended between a dream and consciousness, it is like having your mind exploded to the extent you begin questioning the most basic aspects of existence that you never once thought to question.
