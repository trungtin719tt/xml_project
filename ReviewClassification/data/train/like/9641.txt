Criminological Thriller at its best.One of the books I would recommend to thriller fans.Plot :Scott, a drug dealer. Angela is a drug dealer's daughter. They want to get out of this bad-bad world.Scott and Angela give you a great time telling their versions.In one way, I enjoyed knowing about the routine of people involved with drug business. It was entertaining and new for my taste.Scott gets an opportunity to come out of it, will he leave the path and go for what his heart speaks?That you've to figure out.Writing Style :Not only crime fiction is there, but romance and family blends themselves pretty nicely. I've done my best not giving you any spoilers for this one. The author has definitely broken up all the stereotypes. You might like this theme or you might not, but you certainly can't deny the quality of this writing.This debut novel impressed and astonished me.
