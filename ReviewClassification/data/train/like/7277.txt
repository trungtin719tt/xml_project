This is my first James Patterson, so I'm not entirely sure about his writing style, but I guess the way he's written this book was as if it was the protagonist. Patterson writes in the voice of the girl hero Maximum Ride, and ends mostly with small cliffhangers, which compels the readers to continue reading. (I couldn't really put it down; I kept wanting to find out what happened to the characters.)Patterson didn't only place small cliffhangers at the end of the chapters, he added a huge one for the next (few?) books; that Max was destined to save the world. So far, there is nothing on that.While reading this book, another book came to mind:The Bar Code Tattoo. In both, the experiment of combining avian and human genes were present, as were there being six "members". For both, one of the members were blind, and there were superpowers for them. As for the rest, it's better if you read it.I want to continue this series for various reasons: 1. I want to see how she saves the world; 2. there's the whole "mutant" thing, and 3. it's part of a series (I'm sort of a sucker for series).
