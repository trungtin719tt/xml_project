This book - what shall I say about it? Steve transcends himself here. If I were asked to pick the best book ever written by Stephen King, this would be it.The horror here is all too human. The cruelty of human beings to one another - the lawmakers as well as the lawbreakers - is presented in the closed confines of the death row of a prison. The story is narrated by Paul Edgecombe, the prison warden; now in an old folks' home, awaiting the inescapable executioner - The Grim Reaper with his sickle. As Paul recalls the events from a certain period in the death row of Cold Mountain Penitentiary, we meet psychotic murderers as well as sadistic cops, and peaceful and gruesome deaths as the condemned walk the length to the electric chair - the corridor known as the "Green Mile".The story revolves around the enigmatic figure of John Coffey, sentenced to death for brutally raping and murdering two young girls: Coffey, who has the power to heal anything through his touch. It's this gift (or curse) which drives the story forward until we come to its bittersweet end. There is, however, a note of quiet despair at the finish - yes, sometimes in life, the Green Mile can be too long.
