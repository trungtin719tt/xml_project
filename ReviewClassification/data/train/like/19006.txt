This book was a Christmas gift because my dad was a pilot in WW2. I had trouble putting it down at night to go to sleep- Steve's account of pilot training was very interesting. They didn't have much flight time before we sent them overseas. I also found it interesting how many ships were lost that were not related to the mission. Then I got to the part about being shot down - I just stayed up reading all night. Put this on your must-read list.
