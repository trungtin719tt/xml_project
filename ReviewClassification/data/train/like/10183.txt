This is yet another wonderful Shakespearean play that I read. I have watched the play but this is the first time I read it. The play consists of a great story on justice, love, loyalty and mercy. It is full of drama and intrigue and the read was absolutely wonderful.There is however much criticism on this play for its antisemitic portrayal. It must have been the general view and treatment of the society towards the Jews. But it is doubtful whether Shakespeare used antisemitic portrayal to discriminate the Jews or to heighten the discrimination to which they were subjected to.It is also a little surprising why this play was categorized under the comedy genre, for there was tragedy too in the light of Shylock's predicament. But I suppose that since the play was ended on a happy note, the comedy genre is justifiable.
