I got this anthology for a class and I thought it might be easier to put this up rather than each Jane Austen novel. I really liked it, and it's portable being a normal sized paperback; just thicker. But since I love Jane Austen, this is perfect for me! I really like Sense and Sensability the best, of course, followed by Pride and Prejudice. Emma, Mansfield Park and Northanger Abbey were good as well, but this is a great way to read all of her works without a large hardback anthology that is suited more for a doorstop than actual reading.
