Murder on the Orient Express is my second Agatha Christie novel. The first was The Murder of Roger Ackroyd which I loved and like Murder on the Orient Express I didn't guess the killer. Agatha Christie is The Best-Selling novelist of all time and pretty much invented and perfected the whodunit. Orient is neatly crafted, elegant and fun.All of Christie's novels(I'm basing this on all 2 of her books, I've read) have a simple layout, A murder is committed, an array of suspects and just enough info to pose a theory. It sounds simple and you should be able to solve it but I didn'tDAMN IT!With Orient a man is murdered on a train, all 12 people on the train car are suspects, the train is snowed in and the police cannot reach it. Unfortunately for the murderer, the world famous detective Hercule Poirot is on board. This sounds so simple but I didn't guess the murderer.As soon as the murderer was revealed I felt dumb because it was so obvious and therein lies the genius of Agatha Christie.Obviously I recommend this book.Book Riot 2018 Read Harder Challenge: A classic of genre fiction ( mystery)2018 Badass Books Challenge: A classic book or a book published over 100 years ago.
