People who have read this series PLEASE DON'T ABANDON ME WITH MY FEELINGS come talk to me.I'm sobbing here, I actually thought there was something wrong with me because I've been feeling like I couldn't truly connect to characters in YA anymore, especially their romance. But this series just showed me that the problem is not me, it's the lack of development and depth in so many other books out there. God, I hope I'm not ruined for other YA.VA is for sure my favorite series after only Harry Potter. And to think that these late 2000's books are better than many recent YA lying around. It's like nowadays many authors forgot they don't have to use the same formula and tropes over and over again. I wish other well developed series like Vampire Academy got more recognition so I'd find out about them.My babies have been through so much already, but thank goodness for Bloodlines. I don't know what I'd do if the spin off didn't exist. Can't wait to read it!
