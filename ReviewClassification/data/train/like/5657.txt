One of those fun books that I recall from my younger days, though I'm not sure if I owned a copy or not.Grover repeatedly warns readers to not keep reading for fear ofThe Monster at the End of This Book. As you turn pages, Grover tries multiple options to keep you from reading further, only to be met with less and less success until we get to the final pages.If you haven't read this yet (it's all of 20 pages tops), I won't spoil anything. But I will say that this one is as delightful to read to Shortcake as it was to read when I first stumbled across it years ago. There's even a board book version that is shorter for less patient readers. But really it eliminates some of the fun of Grover's desperate pleas to stop turning those pages.
