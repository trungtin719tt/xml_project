Annie Proulx's style of writing calls to mind the old saying of new shoes and how they pinch the feet until the owner gets used to them, or is it the shoes that get used to the owner? In any case, Proulx is an excellent writer, and this story required some patience on my part. At first it seemed as though just as I was getting into the story, it would make a jerk and toss me off my course until at some point the fragments seemed to align themselves and what was the final piece, was a beautiful mosaic, exquisitely rendered.Quoyle, the main character in this novel, is an outcast with what he calls generational ill luck. From childhood, he has been bullied and shut off by his family and those around him with the exception of his friend Partridge. His wife Petal hates him, abuses and misuses him while leaving all parental duties of their two daughters to him, he finds no fulfilment in his work and it is until tragedy strikes and an aunt arrives that Quoyle is able to disentangle himself from a rather sad life leaving for a small community in Newfoundland.It is in this small tightknit community that Quoyle finally, even though in his late thirties, blossoms. At first, Quoyle is filled with such low self-esteem and great self-loathing that he invites more contempt than pity, even to the reader. He slowly comes to a point of self-realisation, surrounded by a community that offers friendship and love.Proulx depicts this small community with such brilliance. Its traditions, landscape, economic state, weather, kindheartedness, cruelties all done with incredible compactness.A wonderful story. I love a good tale about reinvention and starting over and I'd especially recommend this if you do too.
