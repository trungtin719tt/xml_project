This one goes down as my all time, #1, best read. I learnedSOmany things and gained more strength and independence than I though possible. The story is this, Ayla is cast out from her family, leaving behind her only son, to survive in the ice age and the wilderness alone. She has the knowledge of a medicine woman, and the skills of a sling to assist her survival. But the greatest challenge is the loneliness. She teaches herself to hunt with spears, to make knives, baskets, and implements for cooking. And along with her, I learned how to do all of these things. How to test plant foods for nutritional or medicinal properties. How to survive. She adopts a horse foal after killing her dam and then adopts a baby cave lion. The three of them make a family, and they give her the only companionship the empty icy world has to offer. Until finally after 3 years of emptiness, she meets her future mate. This book got me through my divorce, and the first time I ever lived alone. My heart goes out to theJean M. Auelwho reached into my soul and helped me find what moves me.
