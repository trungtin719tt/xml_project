A favourite of both my children. My daughter had a board book version of this that she absolutely loved from about 6 months on. She loved the holes in each page and every single time we read it she had to pretend her little finger was the caterpillar and make eating noises at every hole, and when the butterfly emerges we had to make the book flap into the air. It's not a realistic representation of a butterfly and obviously the butterfly isn't eating usual butterfly food but this was a well loved book in our house for years.
