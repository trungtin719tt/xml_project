5* for the Film, and 3.5* for the Book. However, I think that's largely due to the order of text consumed, rather than the film being better than the novel. The narrative itself, pertaining to both texts, is the overall winner here.Although I haven't revisited the film in a while now, it was one of my favourites. I must have seenit at least half-a-dozen times or so. I loved the relationships, the unique setting of the mile, the notions of good vs evil, and the wonderful array of characters. The direction, cinematography, sets, costumes and actors were also superb.The novel originally came out in Dickensian episodes, chapter by chapter, which highlighted King's influence at the time in terms of popularity. I only bought it much later though as a single novel. I think the chapter elements do show through slightly; it feels a little more repetitive than most of King's works.The story itself is ultimately a beautiful one, with both tragic elements along with hopeful ones, and King's usual evocative portrayal of relationships. King's use of a more gentle magical realist atmosphere, rather than his more overtly fantastical horror elements, also made the text more subtle and intriguing. The ending too, customarily King's perpetual pitfall, is hauntingly beautiful.The major reason the book was less enjoyable was most likely that as a Green Mile film tragic, the story was, for the most part, the same (although the book extends the ending further). Most likely if I'd read the novel before the film, I'd have given it five stars instead.Regardless, I'd happily recommend both the film and the novel to film buffs and readers alike. It's a touching narrative, both poignant and meaningful.
