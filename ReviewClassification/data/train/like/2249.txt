My assistant Amanda has been a John Green fan for ages, which is one of the reasons I decided to start giving his stuff a read.I decided to start here because it was one of his first books.After I finished this book, I went to her and asked, "Are all of John Green's books going to leave me feeling like I've had a hole kicked straight through my guts?""Not all of them," she said. "But yeah. Some."I thought about this for a while, then asked her. "In Name of the Wind, when X happens, did it feel like that when you read it?"(Except I didn't say X, obviously. I mentioned a particular scene in my first book.)"Well," Amanda said, "Not really. His scene is more central to his book. But even so, yeah. It was kinda like that.""Shit," I said. "Sorry about that."So yeah. Sorry about that.
