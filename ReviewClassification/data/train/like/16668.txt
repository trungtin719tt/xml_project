Well, this wasbutterflyinggood!I was so surprised by how much I enjoyed this more than Slammed. I didn't read this right away after I finished Slammed because when I read the blurb I thought it would be more dramatic and frustrating. But boy, was I wrong! Because it was actually a hell lot of fun! Although, yes, there were those stressing and dramatic parts, but I also did get alotof laughs in this one. Which I wasn't really expecting at all. I was really glad I didn't put off this book for a long while. Ibutterflyingenjoyed it!Reading this in Will's POV made us see his and Lake's relationship in a different angle. Which was also a big treat since I love guy's pov and it's freaking Will! I was happy and greatly entertained to get on his mind and see a lot of different sides of him. His journal entries were one of my favorite parts of this book, it was sweet and funny. Also, I really enjoyed seeing him slipped away a little from his control and restrains especially when it comes to Lake.And just as any other relationships, theirs came with obstacles and hindrances they must overcome. Although I did get so stressed out and frustrated by it I understand that what had happened had contributed a lot for the development of their relationship. I'm not entirely happy with Lake's reaction but once she finally explained it I realized that what they were going through was necessary for them to grew and understand their relationship even deeper and to proved that their love wasn't just brought because of their same tragic situation.And just like in Slammed, Will never failed to mesmerized me by his poetry. I wasn't just touched, If*ckingbutterflying fell in love. I can't even tell you how much I loved that slam poetry he did to prove his love to Lake without gushing! I loved loved loved it to the highest level! Other things I enjoyed so much in this book was Kiersten! She could be my new freaking best friend. I adore this girl and I laughed so hard with her humor and wittiness. And that poetry she pulled off on the last part, I can line that up on my most favorite poems I read from this story! Yeah,Butterfly You!LOL! Kel and Caulder still managed to entertain me and touched me. They were just the cutest baby brothers ever! Can I have them?This book definitely captivated me! I laughed, swoon, loved and teared up a bit! Colleen Hoover did another great job and I'm so happy to be able to read this wonderful story! I had so much fun reading this and I recommend this. :)This review is also posted atBook Overdose
