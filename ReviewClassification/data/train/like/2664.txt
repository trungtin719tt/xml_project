"It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities."- Albus DumbledoreSuch a wise wizard.You know how sometimes when you read the first in a series and it turns out so much better than you originally anticipated, it makes you a little apprehensive when starting the sequel? Well, I felt that way before starting this, but I can definitely say thatHarry Potter and the Chamber of Secretsis another fabulous installment in the rightfully beloved Harry Potter series!And while Iwilladmit to not loving it quite as much as its predecessor, I still enjoyed it a great deal.I think the reason for my not liking it as much can be mostly credited to the introduction of a new character, Professor Lockhart. Lockhart is an annoyingly pretentious wizard who is completely full of himself, and the majority of his teachings were based on his own life and his supposed brushes with death that he escaped only because of his "heroism" and great knowledge of the magic arts.(view spoiler)[Riiiiiiiiight.(hide spoiler)]In a summary, I didn't find the story involving Lockhart quite as interesting as Harry's realization of his true abilities and the escapades of his first year at Hogwarts.But HP II undoubtedly still has plenty of hilarious moments and magical wonders - not to mention the lovely cast of characters - to more than compensate for this particular installment's slightly lacking plot. Hence the five stars. :)(view spoiler)[Very clever Ms. Rowling, very clever indeed.(hide spoiler)]FAVORITE QUOTE:"I've heard you hate those Muggles you live with," said Ernie swiftly."It's not possible to live with the Dursleys and not hate them," said Harry. "I'd like to see you try it."Next up isHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban, and I'm very much looking forward to it.**********************************************************My reviews of other titles in this series:Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone
