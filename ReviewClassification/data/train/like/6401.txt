It is always better to avenge dear ones than to indulge in mourning.Well that was a surprise. I didn't expect at all to like this book (well, epic) at all, especially because I read it for university, but I ended up enjoying it quite a bit. I liked the characters, the plot, the setting and I especially liked the fantasy element to the story. I'm just happy that I enjoyed something Ihadto read for university, because that doesn't happen very often.
