What a magnificent book. Thanks to GR friend T for the review that inspired me to read it.Though the battle scenes are stellar, it is the way Shaara touches everything else that makes this book special. Here is one brief passage."Just before dawn Buford rode down the line himself, waking them up, all the boyish faces. Then he climbed the ladder into the white cupola and sat listening to the rain, watching the light come. The air was cool and wet and delicious to breathe: a slow, fine, soaking rain, a farmer's rain, gentle on the roof. The light came slowly: there were great trees out in the mist. Then the guns began."See what all he has done here? This is poetry. The "boyish" faces, the "white" cupola, the dawning, the gentle rain. The purity and innocence before battle. The commanding officer climbs the ladder and sits listening and watching. Buford breathes it all in, "slow", "slowly", knowing it cannnot last. There are no farmers in that field, nor is there a safe roof under which to hide. Only an empty field, outside a small town in Pennsylvania, July 1, 1863. And then, too soon....."the guns began."Each chapter presents the viewpoint of a Confederate or Union commanding officer which humanizes the participants, but more importantly, creates the stark contrast of war's inevitable dehumanization. These viewpoints also present the tactics of warfare, and the process of decision making that are universal to all wars. Which has changed of course. No longer (hopefully never again) do waves and waves of men charge and fall, charge and fall and there are forms of technology that enable decision making. But the thought processes, feelings, and injury and death - the humanization and dehumanization, that is what I take from this book.More Kudos:MapsCharacter profiles before/after storyClarity of battle scenes (I generally get lost in the logistics)
