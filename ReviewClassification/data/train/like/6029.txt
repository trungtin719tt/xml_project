This story is an institution from my childhood. I first heard it as a child; my mother told it to me as a bedtime story (yes, my mom is like that). I was creeped out totally - and continued to be so while I read the story in umpteen plagiarised translations (where the hound was changed to all kinds of animal including a monkey) and finally in the original. I even saw two movie adaptations, one in Malayalam (Agnimrigam- bad) and one in Hindi (Bees Saal Baad- good).If you are a mystery buff and don't know the story of this one, then most probably you are not living on this planet! "The Hound of Hell" terrorises the Baskerville family, a curse visited on them because of a womanising ancestor who sold his soul to the devil to abduct a woman. The hound is apparently bent on killing all the members of the family. It is left to Holmes to battle the forces of darkness and save Sir Henry Baskerville, the last of the line.As mysteries go, this is not your classical whodunit, but it is an eerily suspenseful story which will keep you glued to the page. And I found the concept of the hound genuinely frightening - apparently Conan Doyle based this on a real Dartmoor legend.--------------------------------I had the chance to visit Dartmoor and enjoy its wild beauty in 2009: also visit the house where Conan Doyle stayed while writing this book, which is now a museum.
