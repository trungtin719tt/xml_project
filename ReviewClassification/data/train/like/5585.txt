I enjoyed Dead Until Dark more than I thought, I had only watched the first season of True Blood and I liked it alright but I never felt any desire to watch any other seasons. Season one stays very loyal to the book. I did miss Tara, she was my favorite character from season one. Since I remembered the first season I knew who the killer was but that didn't bother me because this book was just so much fun to read.As with the show I found Sookie to be annoying but not enough to dampen my enjoyment of the book. Bill was just as boring in the book as I remembered him from the show. I'm hoping in the next book I get more Eric and maybe Bill grows a personality. The book didn't have as much sex as I thought but it was just as gory as I thought.Recommended for fans of Laurell Hamilton and Anne Rice. This is not Twilight, so if you like your vampires sparkling and brooding this is not the series for you.2018 Badass Books Reading Challenge: A book turned Tv show you've seen but never read.Around the Year In 52 Books: A book written in first person perspective.Read-A-Thin May Challenge: Read a book you've been meaning to get to but haven't.
