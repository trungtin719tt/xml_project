This is absolutely my favorite book of all time. I really can't remember when I first read it so I just guessed. I have always loved Grover as long as I can remember. It is such a clever and fun book, and while it does kind of play on kids' little rebellious streaks (turning the pages when Grover is trying everything in his power to get the reader not to), it also incites kids to keep reading all the way to the end, to finish what you start, to foster a healthy sense of curiosity, and even to not be so afraid of something that you shouldn't really be afraid of. (So many levels to look into here! haha Never even really thought about that before! I just love the book!) Definitely a highly recommended read for young and old alike!! :)
