Unlike a lot of "chick-lit", this one was semi-believable and I actually liked the main character (Rachel). She was a smart girl, not all obsessed with shopping and spending money...she just seemed like a normal person, someone I might hang out with. Darcy, on the other hand...irritated me SO bad (probably because the story was written from Rachel's point-of-view and you could see as the story went on how badly she was treated by Darcy). I liked that it got into the plot immediately, and it kept me interested. I'm looking forward to reading the sequel from Darcy's point-of-view soon!
