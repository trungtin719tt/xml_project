The best book I've read in a while. Don't ask me if it was as good as Trainspotting because that was ages ago.Skagboys sounds right. The dialogue written in phonetic Edinburghese(?) was tricky at the start but I soon got into it and was calling my wife a c**t in no time. Seriously, be careful of that. Your head will be taken over by an angry foul-mouthed Scot. (As if there is any other kind.)Skagboys sounds right because it is written in the first person from a number of perspectives. So you get filled in on the action from a number of points of view. The characters don't emerge from some poncey third person narrator describing how they feel about this and that. Instead we are inside the heads of Begbie, Renton, Sick Boy et al from the get go. So it's immediate, personal, intense from the moment Renton goes to a miners protest march with his Dad.The plot line is heroin. A bunch of working class guys from Edinburgh drop out of Thatcher's 1980s revolution and get hooked on skag. It's familiar to those of us who grew up in 80s Britain and Ireland and still exotic to those of us who didn't end up shooting up in a squat.There is and there isn't social commentary in the book. The characters have strong views about what's happening around them, but not as strong as their views on football and getting laid. Like I say, it sounds right.Mainly, it's hilarious. Begbie sums up his views on immigration with "c**nts should stay where they are." And he was talking about some guy who moved to Leith from another part of Edinburgh.If you like cursing, 80s Britain, sex, soccer and booze then you should definitely read this book.
