You begin.It seems like it might be fun.A little bit trashy, but fun.Not so well written.Disappointing.Already, you know it won't be up to much.You keep reading.Why this way?You read, wondering why.It seems pointless.You are bored, your mind wanders.You keep reading.You cannot stop.It is dark.So dark.The atmosphere.Dark. Macabre. Gothic. Haunting.Erotic.You are trapped.Trapped in someone's twisted fantasy.Kinky.Until pain and suffering and anguish and loneliness are beautiful.Alluring.Seductive.But you know that they are not, and no book will make it so.You keep reading.You are bored. You put the book down.But you have to finish it.You keep reading.You read.Waiting for gratification.Waiting for something to happen.Waiting.You cannot look away.You keep reading.It is a beautiful day outside.You keep reading.So dark.So sensual.So strange.The plot shifts.A small climax.You groan.Sigh.Still a hundred and fifty pages left.You keep reading.Repelled.Attracted.You shift positions.You ache for more.You keep reading....Blam! Kazam! Ka-POW!Climax!Death! Destruction! Fire!Alone.Downwards spiral.Depression.Dark.So dark.Come on, suicide.There is no suicide.Wandering.Searching.Existential angst.Oh.That was all.What a stupid ending.
