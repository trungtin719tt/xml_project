In his school days he became friends with Finny, an outstanding athlete. Finny was a favorite of everyone. fellow students used to look up to him as their inspiration and teachers were mighty impressed with this boy for whatever he said prevailed. Gene was a spectacular student academically while Finny's dream was to attend Olympics of 1944. Then one day in accident Finny fell from a tree and broke his legs and with it his Olympic dreams. And the story evolved it was revealed that accident that broke Finny's leg might be intentional.Once Finny's back in school, things never get back to normal. For one it was WWII and students found themselves to be in difficult situation. They wanted to go and yet were hesitating after all to stand right in front of death was not a happy place to be. Environment at Devon got suffocating and poisonous with each passing day. One can draw the similarities between Devon and America in WWII. how the war was effecting the peace and hesitation of Devon and America to jump in the War..But this story stands out in how it describe the suffocation that one felt when they come to realize that the bad that they had done need not to be done. The guilt and remorse just eats them out. confession would led to losing the love that they so dearly want and crave and yet in the bottom of their heart they know they don't deserve that trust, devotion, and love.a beautiful tale of friendship, trust, love, jealousy, and betrayal.
