4 tiny stars but still 4. It's not 3.5. It's more. So I'm rounding up although I'm quite conflicted about it.Let's face it guys. This was first published in 2001. Howmanysimilar books are published since?! I'll tell you -quite many!Still the story is very interesting and the book keeps its ground. If you're looking for a very good UF read with strong focus on werewolves, that's your book.My big, big issues are/were with Elena. Our idiotic(most of the time) protagonist. Oh, she's not stupid. Not at all. I'm just not very fond of her life choices throughout almost the entire book.Everything else wasverygood.More of my thoughts to come when I am in the mood. May be.
