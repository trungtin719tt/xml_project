Now I can relax. I don't wanna say it but it's true. Regardless of so much tension here, I can relax now 'cause my favourite ship of all time is safe. Safe from the Hell! I mean it. Hell!This book was as amazing as I expected it to be. I liked how things were carried out.=&gt; Doors of Death. One end in the mortal world, another in Tartarus. I thought they were kind of black-hole-ish type. But no. They were elevators. This fact was amazing that they were held by chains in both places. And they had to cut them to free the Doors and stop the coming of more monsters in the mortal world.=&gt; Hecate, goddess of magic, got a little spotlight here. That was interesting. Her interaction with Hazel made the book amazing.=&gt; Frank!Wowowow!He surprised me most of the time. Every time he appeared, he got something. Something that changed his personality. I love him! I like him with Hazel.=&gt; Jason. He seemed a very serious version of Percy to me. Regardless, I love him.=&gt; Nico. *cough cough cough* I was stunned byTHATrevelation. But I have convinced myself not to dwell onTHAT. I am really looking forward to see him with Reyna. *Please, Uncle Rick*=&gt; Leo. Really? Is there a need to say that I love him or not? Who can hate him?I am dying to find out how he will fulfil his promise.=&gt; Last but not the least, Percbeth. Everything they went through in Tartarus was just jaw-dropping. I admit there were some coincidences BUT nothing matters when you love the characters above everything. This is my silly opinion. I am literally trash for both of them.Be honoured, little demigods, said the god of the pit. Even the Olympians were never worthy of my personal attention. But you will be destroyed by Tartarus himself.Overall, a not-to-be-missed book.October 30, 2017
