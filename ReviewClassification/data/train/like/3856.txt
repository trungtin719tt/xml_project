Tough one to review. A little slow in spots but so interesting. This is basically the philosophy of Jesus Christ and his rise to being the messiah. This story certainly differs from the gospels. A.) it's told from a woman's perspective and B.) the God, Man, Son relationship is very philosophical! C.)If you believe in everything the gospels say then read this as fiction, which is what it's labeled as anyways.
