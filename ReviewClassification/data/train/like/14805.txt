I loved this book. The characters were so real. I felt like I was right there in the town, in the small home, smelling the same things, eating with them, doing dishes. How did Llewellyn accomplish that?This was the second time I read this (the first being when I was a young teenager.) I'll be reading it again throughout my life, I'm sure. I'm convinced a teenager's brain is made of fluff, for I remember very little from that first reading. It was as if I hadn't read it before, almost. This second time, I was deeply affected.So much of the struggles with the mine and their wages really hit home. Times aren't really so different now and it was good to read my husband's thoughts and feelings on the pages of a book published 70 years ago, so beautifully and accurately written by Llewellyn. Good and bad, I guess. I was glad to have insight into man's heart, but saddened that the fight in life is so much the same still. I'm under the false impression that with time, the quality of humankind's life in general improves. Books like this teach me that it isn't necesarrily so in some aspects.Maybe that is what made the book so touching to me: it hit on the joys and travails of life that are universal. I wept at the end. My two-year-old found me like that and went and told my husband, "Dad, Mom sad." He came and found me and I was still in a state, but all I had to say was, "I finished the book," and he smiled and I smiled and he understood and left me to wrap up the experience in solitude.What a book.
