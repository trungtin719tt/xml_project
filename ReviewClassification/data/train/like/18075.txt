Review/discussion:https://youtu.be/aFX-hrVHFusMy favourite part of reading this was that as I took review notes every time I wrote Kaz it autocorrected to KazooThis freaking book oh my goodness. I LOVED IT, even more than the first one actually. I adore this characters and I must see them again. A Nina spin off perhaps? YES PLEASE.
