omg!! the title is scaring the heck outta me!! oh richelle....please please let rose and dimitri be together, i think i will go into depression if not, i really feel for these characters!! i love them so much. i hope the spin off is adrian's story, though its probably not gonna be. *keep ur fingers crossed and hope!* i love how i wait for each of these books for a whole yr, read it in one day when i get and then the wait starts ALL OVER AGAIN!! gahhhh!! kill me!gosh...never suffered even half this much anxiety over twilight!
