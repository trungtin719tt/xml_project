Although I simply have problem with the title, since it should be One thousand and one night, the translation of Burton is worthy to read and also should be praised to introduce such a masterpiece to Western literature. Not only do these stories depict cultural and social codes of Middle East and centra Asia, but also they convey how morality and wisdom were respected in these societies. As we are living in an era that most people are biased about their originality and are focused on the small world of their own society, these incredible stories make us believe that there is a universality, no matter where we come from and in what era we live, that works out and overcomes violence beyond any power and that is the power of imagination and narrative.
