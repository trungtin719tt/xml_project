I really don't know why goodreads deleted the rating of my favourite book, but as it seems it happened?! O_oWTH?*lol*Well anyway, of course it's a five star, did you expect any different? XDI'll definitely reread it one day and will write a proper review, because this book deserves such an awesome in-depth review that 3.500 words certainly won't be enough! *lol*One day, this screen page is going to crack with my gushing.That's a promise! ;-P
