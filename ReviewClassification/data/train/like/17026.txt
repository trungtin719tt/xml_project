Tim Butcher never fails to impress me for his sheer determination in presenting well known facts in a totally fresh perspective. Sitting here in Trieste - quoted in the book as being one of the two ends of the Iron curtain - I followed his footsteps along his journey across Bosnia and Serbia as though I was actually there with him, his travelogue being all the more relevant to me as it describes regions just a few hundred kilometres from here. Princip's life, his political evolution and his motives are clearly mapped in this book as never before. The author's presentation of the trigger that set off the First World War is interwoven with memories and flashbacks of his own personal journey in the region, from his journalistic coverage of the 90's war, to 2012 when he goes back to the same haunts, reliving the facts of the recent war in Yugoslavia. This makes the book even more relevant to my generation, who in the 90's was on the 'safer' borders of this bloody conflict. And his guilt at not being able to do more than being an observer resonates with my generation, that at 20, was clubbing and drinking itself unconscious whilst people across the border were being tortured and killed meaninglessly. This work deepened my understanding and knowledge of both the 90s war and the First World War showing continuity and circularity of human thought and actions in the Balkans. Butcher's prose is crystal clear and flows with a passion for his subject that pervades all his actions and descriptions. I was particularly impressed by the new documentation he found on Princip and by the use of photographs across his work that complement his writing and make Princip's life so alive and compelling even after 100 years. Last but by no means least I appreciated the author's careful considerations on the concept of nationalism and what its political consequences mean at a time when borders across Europe are being challenged. A five-star piece of writing.
