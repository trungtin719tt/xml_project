JOHN PROCTOR: What... what are we doing here? Where are we?ELIZABETH PROCTOR: We're in a review, John.JOHN PROCTOR: A review?JOHN HALE: Yes, a review. Newt Gingrich has been encouraging people to readThe Crucible. We've agreed to help him.SAMUEL PARRIS: It's our duty, John. We're in the middle of the second worst witch hunt in American history.JOHN PROCTOR: The second worst?SAMUEL PARRIS: Yes, the second worst. After what's going to happen to Donald Trump in 2017. But at least our case is remotely comparable, so it offers people a point of reference.JOHN PROCTOR: What's going to happen to him? Is he going to be pressed under huge stones like my friend Giles Corey?SAMUEL PARRIS: I don't think so.JOHN PROCTOR: Hanged on the basis of false accusations like Rebecca Nurse?SAMUEL PARRIS: I believe not.JOHN PROCTOR: Entrapped and then imprisoned like my poor, wronged wife?SAMUEL PARRIS: I have different information.JOHN PROCTOR: Well, what then?SAMUEL PARRIS: People on late night talk shows are going to make a great many sarcastic comments about his tweeting habit. And after a while, he'll have said so many insane and self-incriminating things that a special counsel will be appointed to find out just what the hell is going on.THE WHOLE COURT: Oh, how dreadful![Pause]JOHN PROCTOR: You're right. We have to do something.CURTAIN
