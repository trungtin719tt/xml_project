After 500 or so years of people writing about, arguing about, despising, lauding and picking apart this book, it's hard for me to come up with anything new to say.Was Machiavelli being sarcastic? Was he publishing a book on how to rule amorally so as to stir up the peasants and make them revolt? Was he trying to bring rule of law into Italy, by any means necessary, and so sent instructions to the Medici's, hoping that that family's demonstrated ruthlessness would be able curb the wayward country?I don't know, I wasn't there, and I'm not about to start an argument over it. What I can tell you is that this is an interesting read. The translation I read was not as hard to parse as old-timey writing tends to be for me, and while I certainly had to concentrate, I was not overwhelmed.The fact is, I love reading stories about Machiavellian bastards; rulers with amoral machinations, men who have planned every step of the conflict well ahead, princes who know how every ally and every opponent is going to react well ahead of time, and is just waiting for everyone to run headlong into the clever trap laid out with subtlety and style.Taking this as a handbook for "awesome fictional villains" is a fun exercise, that might stem your tendency to be horrified at the sorts of things Machiavelli is supporting(at face value, anyways). Should you read this book? Absolutely: it's not very long, and it will make your inner super villian cackle most deliciously.
