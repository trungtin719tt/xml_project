I got my first Bible in 1974 and have been reading the Bible nearly daily since then. I have at least six Bibles. Two of them are falling apart, I've read them so much. God has such a great sense of humor. Whatever page I turn to, there is a message of what I need that day. I was born three months premature and the doctors did not expect me to live. Prayer made the difference. I cannot get through a day without prayer; I do not know how anyone does. The Bible helps me through the worst times in my life. I highly recommend it to anyone who is Christian. I highly recommend the Torah or the Koran to anyone who professes to be one of the other major religions in the world. By reading the Bible, one gains peace. If we as individuals are peace filled, we might bring peace to others in our world and peace to our world. It's worth a try!
