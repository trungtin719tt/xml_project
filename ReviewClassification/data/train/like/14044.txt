I think I enjoyed this better than the first one!! But Sydney, WHY ARE YOU SO STUBBORN?!More thoughts tomorrow! I seem to always finish any book by Richelle Mead at 1 in the morning. I CAN NEVER PUT THEM DOWN.I loved the first book in this series but this second book is my favorite so far. Adrian is hilarious and also adorable, while Sydney is completely oblivious to everything. I'm glad that Brayden did what he did by the end of the book because he was super BORING. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree with me on that.I was super upset with what we find out about Trey. He and Sydney are way more similar than we thought. However, I hope that as Sydney continues to grow and change her opinions, Trey does this as well. It's hard watching characters like Sydney and Trey because they have been brainwashed their whole lives to believe something and because of that change for them is very slow and gradual. But I have a feeling we are going to see more and more growth in the next book and so on.SYDNEY NEEDS TO LET LOOSE A LITTLE. I kind of want to see her go a little crazy....I really don't want to give too much away to those who haven't read the first book but all I'll say is this series is great and it truly just gets better and better.
