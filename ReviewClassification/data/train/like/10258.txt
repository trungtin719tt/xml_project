I've been hearing for years and years that The Last Unicorn is a must read for fantasy fans. It's true.The Last Unicorn is the story of a unicorn living alone in a wood that finds out she's the last and goes searching for her people. Along the way, she meets a bumbling wizard named Schmendrick, a feisty woman named Molly, and eventually a layabout prince named Lir.As withA Fine and Private Place, Beagle's writing is spotted with humor. I can see his influence in Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett's work. Schmendrick seems like an ancestor of Rincewind the Wizzard's. I found the characters to be well rounded, even the villain of the piece, King Haggard.The best of the writing comes with something befalls the unicorn and you can easiy imagine the sense of loss she feels.
