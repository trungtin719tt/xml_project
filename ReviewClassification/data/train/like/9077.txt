There are so many layers of meaning in this book. You can't just close it after the last page and say, "Yep, I read it. Here's what it's about..." The story is fairly simply told, almost understated, but you can feel the author's love for his country and its people, warts and all. There's so much to explore here about hope, despair, love, exploitation, forgiveness, and perseverance. My greatest admiration goes to the Jarvis character for the way he deals with his grief and shows his forgiveness through acts of quiet generosity.The book was written sixty years ago, but the issues and concerns are just as relevant today as they were then---not just for South Africa, but worldwide.Thanks, Elisabeth! I've bypassed this book countless times over the years and would not have read it without your recommendation. :)
