I LOVE ALL OF THESE BOOKS! i was brought into the harry potter world after the second book came out. i enjoyed every book each in it's own way. i loved the first book because it helped me believe in magic again like i did when i was little. i liked the second book because i got to see hermoine grow as a stronger witch. i loved the third one because harry started to really step into his role and there was so much happening. it was an exciting book.i was introduced to dementors, azkaban, escaped convicts and there was more about how harry's parents died. i loved the fourth one because there were dragons, a sphynx, mazes, and voldemort finally came into the books at full power. it was exciting and non stop action. i loved the fifth one because i loved hating umbridge. it was so great to see harry start to step into his role as a leader and fight against voldemort. i loved the sixth because we finally were able to see into the life and rise of voldemort. i also got to delve into the life and mind of albus dumbledore. i especially loved the first six books because no matter how i tried i could not guess how they would end. i think the second one even though it was not my least favorite it was the biggest surprise ending! i have a talent. i can figure out the endings to movies and books but j.k. rowling always kept me guessing. at least until the seventh book. i of course had no idea about the deathly hallows but i did guess all the major parts. now i loved the seventh because it brought all the other six books together. i was able to see harry turn from boy to man. i loved that the author took us into the future and shower harry's family. these are all books i could read over and over. the instant i read one sentence i am instantly transported in the magical world of harry potter.
