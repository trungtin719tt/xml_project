*****You can read my full review atDarling &amp; Co.*****A lot happens in the 3rd House of Night book, and it all only takes course over a few days. I found myself becoming annoyed with Zoey more in this book; she is making a lot of basic mistakes that people in books/movies/TV shows always make. And just like every other character, her mistakes pile up, they're found out, and she falls hard.During this series, I have spent a lot of time thinking about the phrase"the path to hell is paved with good intentions."Zoey has a lot of good intentions with trying to handle everything on her own, but she could have handled everything a lot better. She could have filled her friends in on it once Neferet left for her vacation and they could have taken care of Stevie Rae then, and they probably would have understood better why she hadn't told them when Neferet was around.My hopes for the next book are that we learn more about Stevie Rae; that we figure out what the hell happened with Aphrodite; and that Zoey's friends give her a hard time about all the shit she's pulled, but they find a way to work through it and can take down Neferet.
