Won't she?Secrets upon secrets, suspicion, fear and some answers that will born more questions, an accidental tragedy and the worst fate a woman can wish, will bring Mac on the fringe of sanity and by the end destroy her.THIS ENDING... HOLY FREAKING HELL!Utterly heartbreaking, dream-crashing and soul-punching (I just come up with words because english fail me when I am upset..) the ending was every nightmare come true. Repulsive and disturbing, I couldn't tear my eyes away and pray for Mac's soul... HELL! How is someone surviving this kind of cliffhanger??I hang on the promise of light and happiness... barely. Mac, is a part of me now. The series is like reading someone's journal, witnessing their wins and losses, inner-struggles and emotions. I am in love with Barrons (come on Mac freaking admit it!), in lust with V'lane (no stones sisters... my reproductive organs are functional and appreciate a gorgeous male specimen) and best friends with Dani (I feel ya girl, I wouldn't know where to give my virginity either with these too...). Amazing, highly emotional, dark and nail-biting I can't recommend this series enough.On to the next, IMMEDIATELY!
