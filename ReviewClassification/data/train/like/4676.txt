Dear Stephanie,I understand that you're really irritated that someone you trust would take your unfinished manuscript and run off with it. I can only imagine the betrayal you must feel, even violation. I can see why you would want to put it on hold indefinitely but COME ON WOMAN!!!! What I read from this was sooo very much better than Twilight. Seriously. How could you start something like this and leave it. Give us a glimpse into the mind of such a "godlike" vampire such as Edward and take it away? I can only hope that one day, you will change your mind as I imagine you will. May his untold version of the story eat away at your heartless soul until there is nothing left.Only kidding... I hope you keep your soul but I can only imagine how much this unfinished work will bother you until the time comes when you will finish it.Regards.
