Ginsberg spent years, hunched over his typewriter, working at poetry, sending out poems with little validation for his talent from the gatekeepers of poetry, poetry magazines and literary journals. Then around 1956 City Lights published this little, very little book Howl. A year later Ginsberg got lucky when a plain-clothes SF cop came into the City Lights book Store and bought a copy of Howl, arresting the store manager and subsequently the publisher for dealing in obscene material. Bingo! With that Ginsberg was pushed into the limelight when the trial made the news. The copy I had said that almost a million copies were in print. I'm sure most readers were looking for what was so obscene - disappointed no doubt.I've listened to it many times on YouTubehttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WkNp5...Howl, the first poem, has a wonderful rhythm and cadence to it. In the book Ginsberg said he got the title from Kerouac and some of the phrases.I don't understand all of it, for instance, what does "negro streets" mean, if anything? But I don't have to understand everything to enjoy poetry. After all, it's poetry not an essay. Different parts of the poem were written at different times, like the footnotes and part 2, which didn't seem like they fit with part one.There's a few other wonderful poems in the book. Like I said, it's a small book.
