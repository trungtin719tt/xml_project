Couldn't resist reading an entirely different book by someone who has filled her work with such intense meaning and historical accuracy. What a surprise. Longfellow seems to be able to write anything. This one is nothing likeThe Secret MagdaleneorFlow Down Like Silver: Hypatia of Alexandria. It sneaky and sly and up-to-date and strange and pure literature even though it goes down like oil. It's about a writer, a second-rate writer, whose life has come to such a pass (partly through her own doing) that she's on the run. Which brings her back to the only town in her ambitious life that meant anything to her. A small town in Vermont in which stands a old hotel she remembers as magical. River House has come down in the world, just as she has, and together they weave themselves into a fantastical knot of other people's talent, first rate talent, or first rate ghosts. I loved it. I think it's right up there with the very best psychological horror.
