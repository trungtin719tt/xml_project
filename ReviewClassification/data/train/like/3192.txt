This book is one of those that I would consider required reading. Marion Zimmer Bradley's telling of the Arthurian legend from the point of view of Morgaine is so captivating that even twenty years later, I come back to it.It's the story of Britain after Rome has faded but the influence of Rome, particularly through spreading Christianity hasn't. Britain is on the cusp where the spread of Christianity is eclipsing the native, ancient religion. You'll see all the familiar names from the legend, Arthur, Guinevere, etc., but their roles may not be exactly what you expect. In Bradley's tale, Morgaine is a priestess of Avalon who tries to serve the Goddess, the Lady of Avalon, her King and brother and is ill-used in the process. For me the book succeeds because when I read it I got the sense that it could have happened like that (if you're willing to suspend disbelief enough for the magical elements of the story).When I first read this, I couldn't put it down. If you haven't read it, you should remedy that!
