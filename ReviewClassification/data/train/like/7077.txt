This book has a really interesting play with language, consequence of Dahl's genius. It can be read in that way as a child's Ulysses. Very fun, simple plot, if slightly odd. I missed reading this as a child. As an adult I enjoyed this hugely, but I know I would have LOVED it as a child. The story has a pleasurable pace and kept me engaged, the characters were beautifully described with attention to detail and humour. It's Roald Dahl, what is there not to love!? A classic! My inner child is smiling with glee!
