The ending surprised me and it was the one that I really wanted to happen. What can I say about Discworld that has never been said before. Nothing, but I need to tell you to read Mort.Mort is a cataclysmic story of epic proportions. I thought Death(the Discworld character) was going to bite dust, you know? I really don't love every single book in the series. In fact I started and gave up reading Mort a couple of years ago.So, why do you need to read Mort? Well, it teaches you how to thread a story of your own. Also, it's surprising and imaginative to boot. The Discworld books are polarizing. It won't hurt if you started your adventure with Mort. Terry Pratchett was an uneven genius.
