Find me onInstagram&amp;Twitter!I can't believe how much this series has grown and evolved to get to where it has ended. It just feels so bittersweet that I'm finally done!I really liked Ignite Me, but I didn't love it as much as Unravel Me. In fact, I did have a few complains. I'll go more into this later but I wasn't too fond that this final book focused way too much on the romance. I could say that only 100 pages out of the 400 total had to do with bringing down The Reestablishment. And because of that, we really didn't have too much action going on. You can tell that Tahereh Mafi spent too much time with the romance because once you get towards the final chapters, everything just feels so rushed. The Big Bad Wolf that everyone is afraid of dies within like two minutes of coming face to face with Juliette. Lolreally?I don't know, but I do feel a little unsatisfied with the ending. It was a happy ending, just not a very good one since it ends so abruptly. I wished Tahereh actually wrote a heartfelt, bittersweet ending to wrap this whole trilogy up. Instead you're just left thinking,"Oh... that's it? That's the ending?"So, let's talk...Characters:1.Juliette:Wow, I can't even begin to explain how much Juliette has grown as a character.ABOUT FREAKIN TIME.I was tired of the self-pitying crybaby that Juliette was in the first two books. No more of the"I want to die","I don't deserve to live","Everybody hates me"speeches. Thank god! She's definitely gotten stronger and determined.2.Adam:I liked Adam. But after reading Ignite Me, I reallyDON'Tanymore. He was just whiny, overbearing, selfish, everything a boyfriend shouldn't be. Of all the books I've read, I can easily say that he's the biggestassholeever! He treated Juliette like shit and I'm glad she actually fought back and didn't let him step all over her and hold her back. Adam is the type of boyfriend that would make you give up everything you could ever want or work for, just so you can settle and be with him. I don't get how he had the heart to tell Juliette all those things! I understand that he was upset, but he was a loose cannon in almost every chapter and I just wanted him toshut upbecause he was destroying all the good qualities I liked about him.3.Warner:&lt;3333333333333333333333 I've never had abook boyfriendbefore, nor did I ever want one because no male character has been able to sweep me off my feet with just a turn of a page... UNTIL NOW. Aaron Warner Anderson is officially my book boyfriend and husband. &lt;3 He was just all kinds of perfect. I just loved how we got to see the real Warner and the soft side that nobody knew he had. Ahhhhh, marry me.4.Kenji:I'm just glad that Kenji was always there to make us laugh even at the most inappropriate of times. He just made this whole series better with his sense of humor! However, I enjoyed seeing his more serious side as well and his friendship with Juliette. I loved the fact that we actually got a relationship between a male and female without the romance.But I really wished we had more girls in this series. All the girls that were introduced were only in the background and had very few lines. We needed moregirl power!We needed more girls that could kick ass! Juliette was surrounded by all guys, and it would've been really refreshing to see her interact with more girls and break up all the male testosterone.Romance:I'm aHUGEsucker for romance, but I felt like Ignite Me focused a little too much on the love triangle. I could say that95 percentof the book consisted of Adam and Juliette's post-relationship drama and the development of Warner and Juliette's relationship. The remaining5 percentincludes the final "battle" and everything leading up to it.I'm definitely not complaining about the romance though! I was swooning and loving every single moment of Warner/Juliette. And I'm the happiest girl in the world becauseTHE COUPLE I WAS SHIPPING FINALLY ENDS UP TOGETHER FOR ONCE.I could cry from happiness because my couple never ends up together! :')I was never really on board with Adam/Juliette but after reading Shatter Me, I really thought they were endgame considering how their relationship was perfectly convenient. However, that didn't stop me fromcatching the feelswhen Adam and Juliette officially go their separate ways. Their drama wasannoyingthe living crap out of me, but at the same time, I just felt bad. They gave up everything to be with each other and put their feelings out there for the first time despite everything that was going on. It was literallythem against the worldat one point, and I really felt for them. BUT, my couple ends up together so those sad feels were short-lived. :POkay. Now, I'm just going to go sit here and wallow in my withdrawals because it's over. :'(
