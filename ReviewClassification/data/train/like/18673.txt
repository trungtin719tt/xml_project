Clearly capturing the depravity of man while outlining the persecution of the early church, Quo Vadis vividly depicts first century life in the Roman Empire for slave, centurion, and emperor.As Sienkiewicz's final display of descriptive prowess, at the climax he floods his readers' senses with the evidence of a smoldering Rome. I've never been so tantalized by antiquity than after reading this historical fiction.All the while reading a bit like a best seller and not an epic novel from the 1800's.
