I have never wanted so badly for the characters in a book to be real. I want to meet them all the way I want to meet the president, or Taylor Swift.This story is perfectly told. It is perfectly paced, it is brilliantly written, it is beautifully crafted.Andy Weir does this incredible thing where he make the readerfeelthe isolation that Mark Wagner feels, and he does it so subtly, we don't even realize that he's doing it until it's done.The Martian completely captivated me. I couldn't wait to find out what happened next, and I never wanted it to end.
