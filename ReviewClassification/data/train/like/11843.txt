I have read and enjoyed most of Pratchetts books set in the Disc World.For recent reads, whilst I have liked the books for the language and comedy, I have felt that the plots were getting formulaic.This book has reaffirmed my faith in Mr Pratchett. It is a wonderful read, full of pithy comments and hugely funny.
