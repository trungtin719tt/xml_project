A little story about Ishmael by Daniel Quinn:I first read this back in the fall of '99 for a college course. It was a time in my life where (for a variety of reasons, including a breakup of a long relationship) I was first began to think for myself, instead of think what others wanted me to think. This book completely wiped away the world view that my parents, friends, and teachers had put into my head for so many years, and then began the formation of my own view. Since then I have been a seeker.Synopsis:Alan Lomax responds to an ad in the paper that says "Teacher seeks pupil. Must have an earnest deisre to save the world. Apply in person." The ad turns out to have been placed by gorilla who then through telepathic conversation basically explains why things are the way they are in the world.I've found the simple message of this book to have a huge impact on my view of the environment and our human relation to it. Other things, such as the book "Collapse" by Jared Diamond, or Al Gore's movie "An Inconvenient Truth", have also had effect, but "Ishmael" has been the most life-changing in this respect. This book made me aware of the horrible over-consumption of resources of human beings in everyday life. The world will not be saved by programs such as recycling or forest protection programs, because people are countering these programs everyday in their daily activities. What is needed is a change of view of our place in the world, and that's what Ishmael gave me.
