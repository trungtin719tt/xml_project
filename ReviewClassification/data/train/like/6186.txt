*Sigh* So bummed the series is over. Ana and Christian's character evolution throughout the trilogy is unlike any I've ever seen. She started off as a naive, shy college student, while Christian (AKA Fifty) was a cold, aggressive businessman. By the end ofFifty Shades Freed, not only are they closer to one another, but they're also more confident in themselves.In the final installment of the Fifty Shades series, Ana and Christian are married, but that doesn't mean that it's all roses and sunshine for the happy couple. Not only is there the mystery of trying to find out who's trying to kill them -- the suspense definitely has its heart-pounding moments -- but the newlyweds are also adjusting to married life and learning even more about each other. There's more than just nail-biting suspense, though. Of course there's also plenty of spicy bits to go around -- I mean, c'mon, Christian was a Dom when he first met Ana. Of course their bedroom (and other room) scenes are going to sizzle! But their sexual interactions are beautifully interwoven with humorous and somber plot points, character arcs, and the infamous email exchange between Ana and Christian (love those!).After readingFifty Shades Freed, I kept trying to decide which of the three books I loved best. After thoughtful deliberation, I honestly could not come up with a favorite because I love them ALL. So much so that gray may be my new favorite color. Kidding... sort of.*I receivedFifty Shades Freedas a complimentary copy for review from the publisher.
