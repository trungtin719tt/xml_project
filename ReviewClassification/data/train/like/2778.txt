Love in the Time of Cholera by Gabriel Garcia Marquez was the first book I put on my "To Read" list when I first joined GR, and I just never seemed to get around to it. I had previously bought a used copy which someone borrowed and didn't return, and settled for the hardcover edition I purchased a year or so ago. The last few years I've read most books on my kindle so I've been a little spoiled, at least my aching fingers have been, not having to support the weight of a book for any length of time.I loved Love in the Time of Cholera, the writing is beautiful. The story is clearly not for everyone, but it also takes place in an era and location where the morality probably bears no resemblance to how you view "a moral lifestyle". If you're reading this because it's a love story, just don't expect it to be a Disney-type love story.
