Book #3 Voyager, It was so fast paced and exciting in the first 2/3 of the book and I just loved it so much. The last little bit of the actual "Voyage" part could have speed up a bit or there could have less confusing parts.****SPOILERS****My favorite part was of course when Claire finally traveled back to Scotland - although it was 20 years later!! That part I didn't like, those 20 years they will never get back and they seem the most important in their lives. I acutally really liked the beginning of the book when - as the reader - you got to see both of their POV's from the past 20 years and how Jamie survived without Claire.Then end was all over the place and so much happened that didn't need to happen, or the things that seemed important were so confusing on what the heck was happening. I really thought that maybe Claire and Jamie were going to end up travel back to the present together while they were in the cave - so that whole scene I was speed reading through and then when they were on the boat and there was this huge storm it was kinda confusing on what was happening?!?!?! ... Then the whole thing wraps up with their ship going off course by over 600 miles and they wind up in America ... Georgia??? Not what I was expecting!! Now what is going to happen to them!!!!
