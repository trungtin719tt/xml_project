I have written on here many times how much I love Terry Pratchett and how I literally feel like I cannot - can. not. - get enough of his Discworld series. [2015 update: still can't get enough.] I don't write reviews for all the books of his I read because that would be insanely repetitive for both me to write and for you to read. Those imaginary reviews would include the words 'comfort food for the soul' in every bloody review, I can tell you now.But I did want to write quickly about this little gem, as I think it might be my favourite that I've read so far. [2015 update: Yep. My favourite by far.] The stories that are focused on the Watch are always brilliant (it's my personal favourite Discworld arc) but this one that sees Commander Samuel Vimes going back in time to a battle that a younger version of himself also fought in is just especially good. It's heart-warming and heart-breaking, all at once.I had a lot of feelings reading this one, let me tell you that. [2015 update: now that we've lost Terry, my feelings are stronger, if anything.] I love you, Sam Vimes.
