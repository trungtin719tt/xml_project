I had read a lot aboutThe Martian Chroniclesbefore I read this book - and I must say that for a change, the hype was justified. This is an absolutely fantastic piece of literature.I am a bit lenient with the stars in genre fiction - I don't hold them to the exacting standards that I do with literature. So in SF, if the concept is unusual, it tends to gather five stars. But in case of this book, the five stars have nothing to do with genre. It's purely for the literary merit.There are two writers whose stories grew with me - Roald Dahl and Ray Bradbury. I first enjoyed their stories as a pre-teen, right through my teens and youth: and I find that still give me pleasure in a somewhat cynical and crabby middle age.-----------------These set of connected stories about Mankind's Martian expeditions starting from the early nineties to 2026 is not about science. They are about mankind, its infinite need to expand and push the boundaries: at the same time dancing on the edges of self-destruction. It is about exploration, the meeting between alien races who interact and destroy one another without meaning to, most of the time. It is about the casual disrespect of an uppity race and their callous disregard for a centuries-old culture they cannot understand. It is about man, who thinks might is right and that most disputes can be settled with firearms. Ultimately, it is about man who looks on the ruins of his own world, brought about by his own hands, and dreams of building another civilisation on top of it.Reading Ray Bradbury is the sheer, unalloyed pleasure of losing oneself among the pages of a book: of wandering unfettered through a bountiful and boundless imagination. Mars is just a prop: he could have used any planet, any fantasy world. These stories skirt the thin boundary between hard SF and fantasy, and do it masterfully. But ultimately they address human concerns, as all good literature does.Five golden stars!
