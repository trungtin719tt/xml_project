Overall, an enjoyable read. At times it strayed from the main story a bit, and at other times it felt like the author was spending too much time on the names and backstories of secondary role players. I also felt talked down to in a few spots, which I found unnecessary since the general audience for this book will likely have more than a passing knowledge of WWII.Overall, however, there was a good deal of information about the B-17s and the men who flew them. The pictures and diary entries were great additions, and the author obviously went to great lengths in researching the book, its background, and locations. That the subject is the author's father, I'm sure played a large role in the research process.Definitely a keeper and suggested reader. Have bookmarked some pages for further research on my own and for use in y classroom.
