This is a stirring, eerily believable short work by Nevil Shute. It is post WWIII and everyone in the world is dead except those who are in Australia and New Zealand. But, they are not safe, they are just waiting for the radiation to reach them. There is an ample mix of denial and acceptance in each of the characters, some of whom prepare for next year's garden even though they have been told the end is expected in a matter of months.The main characters are a US submarine commander, Dwight Towers, and his counterpart, lt. commander Peter Holmes, an Australian. Towers has survived by virtue of being out to sea at the time of the war, Holmes is a married man with a wife and daughter. These men maintain their military personae to the end and are engaged in measuring radiation levels and other useless research, which they recognize as useless even as they carry their orders out. They seem to need the illusion that there is still purpose and work to be done. It is almost frightening to think that anyone would prefer to continue their work in the face of such catastrophe, but it might beat the alternative of just waiting for life to be finally snuffed out completely.What caused this annihilation?"The bombs were too cheap," said the scientist. "They only cost about fifty thousand pounds near the end. Every little country could have some. And every little country that had some money stated to drop bombs. It thought it could beat anyone else. It could drop the bombs in a surprise attack before the other country was ready. That was the real trouble."Seems all too real and accurate for my tastes. Makes you hope Mr. Shute was not clairvoyant. It is not the big countries that start the war, it is the small ones, but the big ones are dragged into it and the result is devastation for all. As indeed, any nuclear war could only be.
