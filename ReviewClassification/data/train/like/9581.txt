Re-read in November 2014THE ENDING THE ENDING OH MAN I FORGOT THAT WAS THE ENDING. My general thoughts on the book remain the same as the last time I read this; the romance was a bit cheesy, but the mystery and plot twists really held the whole thing together!Onwards to book 2!!First read in January 2013WOOO. AWESOME BOOK. At times the main Mara and Noah gave off a very "Bella &amp; Edward" vibe which was a bit of a turn-off for me, but the whole mystery and creepiness of the book was great! And THAT ENDING. Now I really want to read the second book, but I'll have to wait until my birthday or something for somebody to get it for me since I'm not allowed to buy books this year!
