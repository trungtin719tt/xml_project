Review posted at:Swept Away By Romance4 1/2 stars"THE HEART ALWAYS WINS out over the mind. The heart, although reckless and suicidal and a masochist all on its own, always gets its way."I love this quote from theEdge of Neverbecause it's SO true!The Edge of Neverturned out to be every bit as good as I hoped it would be. I'm still trying to process all my thoughts and feelings about this book but one thing's for sure, I've NEVER enjoyed getting to know two characters more than I did Andrew and Camryn. They owned me from the first page to the last. They're beautifully flawed, real, and immensely lovable. The author captured their essence brilliantly.I did have a few problems with the story though. Not only did the pacing drag a bit here and there, but I felt somewhat manipulated by the book's climax. That said, I've NEVER enjoy the journey of two characters more. The ending was perfect and just what I needed; and though I finished this book feeling exhausted, I also felt elated. I definitely enjoyed this read.November 29th edit:Over the past few days I have revisited some of my favorite passages in this book. I really do love so much about this story that even with those reservations I discussed in my review, I own this book at least another half star.
