Have you ever wondered what life was like during the American frontier era of the early 1800's, before civilization encroached upon its wildness and beauty? If so, you might consider reading this first book in Cooper's "Leatherstocking Tales."Cooper's account was realistic and informative as he had a first hand knowledge of that time and place.His life would be be lived on the edge of civilization in the American frontier town of Cooperstown, New York, founded by his father.I'm not going to say that this book was easy reading, but with a little patience you will learn much of the unspoiled American frontier with Cooper's exact and fascinating descriptions of the flora and fauna.Until the invention of a time machine, I will have to content myself with Cooper's detailed account of life in the primeval America frontier.Cooper tells of the harmonious lifestyle of the Native Americans, living off the land and their respect for nature. I've often wondered what life would be like living off the land in such a manner so I found reading this book a learning experience in that aspect as well.Cooper's knowledge of the Native American lifestyle and its destruction with the advancement of civilization, is also related in this classic book. Decimated by disease and intermingling with the white race removed their way of life forever.The noble Chingachgook and his beloved son Uncas, together with his adopted son Natty Bumppo, better known as Hawkeye, are the last pure blood natives of the Mohican nation. They are making their way to Kentucky to find a wife for young Uncas.Their mission is interrupted by the French and Indian War which will irrevocably change their way of life forever.As they discover a ravaged frontier settlement with all the inhabitants savagely murdered, they soon learn that their Huron enemies are responsible for this heinous attack.They continue their journey cautiously and arrive just in time to save a regiment of English soldiers under attack from the Huron nation. The Hurons under the leadership of Magua have allied themselves with the French army.The English regiment, lead by the tiresome Major Duncan Heywood, along with the Munro sisters, making their way to Fort William Henry and are the only survivors of the Huron assault.They have no idea that Fort William Henry is under attack, as Hawkeye, Chingachgook and Uncas, attempt to safely deliver the Munro sisters to their father.From this point onward, this threesome's intrepid attempts to save the Munro sisters from Magua and his Huron warriors will take your breath away. Their journey to safety makes this classic a harrowing tale of action/adventure.The end of this sad tale has the ancient Chingachgook the only surviving member of the Mohican nation, which Cooper uses to illustrate the advancement and destruction by civilization upon the primeval American forest and the beauty that once existed.The tragic Chingachgook will break your heart as he accepts the destruction of his family, tribe and way of life, as the last living member of the Mohican nation. He patiently looks forward to the day when he will once again rejoin them in the afterlife. Could any fate be more heartrending?Cooper's classic Leatherstocking tales, consisting of 5 books, relate the adventures of Natty Bumppo, which would become popular in America as well as Europe.Whether or not you are a fan of historical fiction, I wish you would give this book a chance at least.For those interested, I'm posting a link to the hypnotic soundtrack, which also has a cult following.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4iyLp...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aVjwB...https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2O40q...Enjoy!
