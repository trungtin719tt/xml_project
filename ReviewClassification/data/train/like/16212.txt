Update: $1.99 Kindle special today ..... for those who can handle reading this book .... the writing - and story gets inside you and doesn't leave quickly."Disgrace" is a perfect title.David Laurie, professor, father, divorced, (twice married), jobless after and inappropriate affair, temporary farmworker, is a 'disgrace'.David dips into a downfall transgression with himself and his daughter, Lucy.Racial tensions run high....violence is on the rise....brutal.....in South Africa. ( and this was post apartheid). .....It was easier for me to understand the "disgrace-of-David".....than it was for me to understand Lucy's train of thought after the horrific things that happened to her.Step into Africa with J.M. Coetzee.....complex, controversial, personal &amp; political.....Choices to cringe over ....yet compassion is circulating in our thoughts.Powerful --- winner of the 1999 Booker Prize*note.... readers who are extremely sensitive to animals abuse, may not want to read this --- or skip over parts.
