Where do I start?! I have so many emotions swirling around inside me right now and I am afraid I won't find the right words to express them. But, I'll start with this...THIS BOOK WAS UNBELIEVABLY FANTASTIC!!! I think Katy and Daemon have become my favorite book couple ever. And, this book is told in both Katy and Daemon's POV. I am not always a fan of the dual POV but it really worked well this time. Sharing Daemon's thoughts and emotions added so much for me. The book starts right up where Opal left off with that huge cliffhanger. Katy is gone. And Daemon will do anything to get her back. The first maybe half of the book was really disturbing. Daedalus has Katy, and they want Daemon. Throughout her stay there, they reveal to her what they have been doing. They actually believe their actions are all for the greater good. That's what they try to convince others of anyway. Each page was some other new and horribly disturbing truth. Once Daemon and Katy are reunited, then starts the sweet parts. Daemon's love for Katy knows no bounds. Some of the moments between them are so heartwarmingly beautiful. But, Jennifer Armentrout is a master. We will be right in the middle of a beautiful moment between Daemon and Katy and getting all warm and fuzzy and then, wham, the tables turn and everything turns to chaos. These two just can't catch a break. I don't think they have more then a few hours of peace at a time throughout the book. Daemon is still our overprotective, sassy, alpha and Katy is still our strong, independent heroine. But, I saw changes in them in this book. I really saw Daemon respecting Katy more as an equal. And I also saw Katy as more accepting as well. Knowing that Daemon is just trying to keep her safe because he loves her so much. One such example is when they are physically running together. Katy wants to run on her own, not to be a burden to Daemon, to run at his side. Daemon knows and respects this. But at one point, Katy realizes that she is holding him back and that she has to give in and lets him carry her. They are a team in this book, more than ever. And then there is my beloved Dee. I have loved her from the first book. In Origin, she doesn't play as prominent of a part, but I love her. And, I am very interested in the character of Archer. I can't wait to see where that goes. I can't say enough wonderful things about this book. If I had to hand out one criticism, it is that I could not get a single thing done of my regular household chores. I could think of nothing else but to read, read, read. So, my husband may not be loving Jennifer Armentrout right about now as much as I am. This series is so fantastic so I hope that I have been able to convince you to give it a try if you haven't already. It will be torture to wait for the final book to come out.
