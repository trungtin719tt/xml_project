If you've never read one of her books, this one sums up the Agatha Christie experience quite nicely.As in: You will never solve her mysteries.Don't bother trying, because it will only infuriate you when you find out that the answer to thewhodunnitis something far-fetched &amp; entirely unbelievable.Roll with it, I say! Just trust that the little Belgian detective will eventually make everything all right, and settle in for a cute (albeit old-timey) mystery.I'm not gonna bore you with a plot synopsis, but if you're a fan of stories that take place on trains, child killers getting shanked, and plenty of stereotypes thrown in for good measure...thenthisis the book for you!
