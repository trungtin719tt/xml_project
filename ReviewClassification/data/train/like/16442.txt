"We go to find our Kingdom....Our own Dur Khaima--our far pavilions."It is a big book packed with drama, great characters, romance, the thrill of battle, and adventure in faraway places, but it's also filled with thoughtful insights into national character and identity--and the complex web of cultures that defined the Indian subcontinent, the British Raj and Afghanistan in the late 19th century.Special thanks to Diane Lynn, Tadiana and all my friends who joined in our buddy read and sharpened my appreciation. Feel free to check out the resources and chime in with more discussions on our Far Pavilions group:https://www.goodreads.com/group/show/...I knocked off one star because I wanted more Juli!! Was there ever a better case for fan fiction?
