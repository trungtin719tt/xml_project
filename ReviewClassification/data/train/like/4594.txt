What a terrific read. Stephen King has done it again. Five wonderful stars. I'm glad that I don't remember hardly any of the movie, because it makes the book so fresh. All I remember is that it had a mouse and huge black prisoner. This book is so much more. It brought all kinds of emotions in me. A very thought provoking novelThe story is set in the 1930's at the Cold Mountain Penitentiary. The Green Mile refers to the tiles on the floor in the death row area. It's where every prisoners had to walk on their last days to meet "old sparkey"King was able to develop the characters so well.John Coffey : (last name not spelled like the drink) the gentle giant who knew people's thoughts and could even heal people. He suffered silently because a lot of people would think he might be slow. So he kept pretty much to himself. What a sweet soul. Sentenced to death for murder of twin girlsPaul Edgecomb : the ward superintendent compelled to help every prisoner spend his last days peacefully. I liked his passion for something when he was on the right track. He's never encountered someone like John Coffey. This story is told from his point of view. It alternates back and forth from the prison to the nursing home he is currently in.I loved Del and Mr. JinglesThe plot flows beautifully. The other characters are well defined and likeable as well, except for a couple. It's an excellent read and I highly recommend if you haven't read it.Things I researched as I was reading, because I want to know these things: Interesting !!Did you know during the depression era that what people really called the electric chair ?In 2008 Nebraska Supreme Court determined that execution by electric chair was cruel and unusual punishment. This state was the last state to eliminate it as sole methos of execution.In 2015 the places where the electric chair is still an option areAlabamaFloridaSouth CarolinaKentuckyTennesseVirginia
