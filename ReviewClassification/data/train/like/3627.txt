It is a strong story, beautiful and sad at the same time. It is a novel of war; a novel of men who question, drink, go to the brothel of the front, who fight, who die or are seriously wounded, who try to understand where it leads them. It is a love story that lasts an hour, a night, a life; which fills the void of man's solitude with the horror of war; which grows in the face of the absurdity of great words such as"duty and honor".A rich vocabulary and a very particular rhythm made of small sentences and numerous repetitions gives the Italian tone to this novel yet very American. The author uses the words brilliantly for descriptions, especially fights, and modifies his style according to the nationality and character of the characters. It is a well researched novel, a powerful novel, a real novel where man finds himself naked face her fears, facing its joys, a modern novel in tone, a great novel!The first pages disturbed me a little, I understood the meaning without understanding the style. I did well to persevere, it is very very well written and the story moved me a lot!Lisbon Book-Fair 2016.
