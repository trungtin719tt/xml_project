This final book in the Chronicles is a bittersweet tale. In The Magician's Nephew, the first book of the series in its chronological order, we see the creation of Narnia and in The Last Battle we see the end of it, at least the end of Narnia as we saw created (if that makes any sense). We meet the last King of Narnia, King Tirian, who as a true Narnian fights with valour, although it is a losing battle. It is kind of sad to read the end of Narnia as it was so true and alive to us readers through seven books. But it is inevitable the story should be so. We are to witness the creation as well as its end.The story of The Last Battle is in a way good against the evil and the losing battle is an indication how evil through greed, trickery and lies corrupt the mind of the forces that allies with good. To me, this was the most thought provoking story of the chronicles. I was very much impressed by the message the author was trying to convey through the fall of Narnia.But to get to the happy side, we see a reunion of all Narnian friends. All the human friends of Narnia from the first king Frank and queen Helen, Digory and Polly, Peter, Lucy and Edmund to Eustace and Jill return to Narnia. And the beasts, from Reepicheep to Fledge, the flying horse are returned too. All these humans and beasts now live happily with Aslan in his kingdom and we all know where that is in our hearts.With the read of The Last Battle, I have completed the Chronicles of Narnia. Through these seven books I lived in the wonderful world of Narnia and really enjoyed living there. I had wanted to read the complete chronicles for years and I'm pleased to have done so. And I'm very happy to say that Mr. Lewis certainly didn't disappoint me.
