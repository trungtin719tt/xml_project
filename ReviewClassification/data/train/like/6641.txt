DisturbingThis is a story of a boy named David who endured the worst abuse I had ever read about, by the hand of the very person who gave him life, his mother.I wanted so badly to pluck David out of the story and hide him away from this vicious woman who to me was never truly a mother, but a monster who took her anger out on a weak small child.Being able to push out a baby does not make you a mother. It's loving and nurturing that baby, protecting that child to the bitter end.I am not a violent person, but by God I wish I could have just five minutes alone with this woman...five minutes.Abuse is never okay for anyone. But for a child it's horrific. I don't understand it and I'll never accept any reason for why someone would hurt a child. Never understand.
