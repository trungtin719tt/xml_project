If this had a secondary title, delivered in "the parlance of our times" it would be THE POUND OF FLESH.I liked this for many reasons but the element that stands out most is Shakespeare's focus. Many of his plays have various, complex, and intertwined sub-plots, some being more interesting than the theme itself, TMOV is focused and almost relentless, we have one simple course of action that the story leads inevitably towards and which keeps the reader and the audience entranced, will Shylock really remain intent on claiming his bond?Even the Duke seems ready to predict that Shylock will relent at the end and just take the money. Other fascinating themes explored are the love of money and love itself, both in romantic terms and in friendship. While Antonio and Portia present complex and thoroughly entertaining Shakespearean characterizations, Shylock, of course, steals the show.
