Over the years, my Dad and I would occasionally have a conversation about this book. It would invariably go something like this:My dad asks, "You have never read My Name is Asher Lev?"and I would reply, "No, I haven't""You are so lucky! Now you still have the joy of looking forward to reading the book.""We've had this conversation before, Dad.""Then why haven't you read it yet?""Because as soon as I read it, you won't say I'm so lucky anymore."I think the risk was worth it to be "less lucky" and I finally read the Asher Lev book. My reasoning is that I still have "The Promise" and "The gift of Asher Lev" that remain unread. I've already read "The Chosen" (twice), and "The Book of Lights".Asher Lev is a practicing Hasidic Jew from brooklyn family that is very prominent and well known among his people, not only in Brooklyn, but in Europe, Russia, and many other places. He discovers early that art and drawing is very important to him, which is generally shunned in his culture. He once has a very pointed discussion with his father where he tells him to never call his drawing foolishness again.Asher becomes a world famous artist despite his father's wishes, and his masterpiece is an incredible piece. The whole description of the time when his parents see the painting is very moving. Asher is painfully aware that his painting will hurt the people he loves, especially his parents. The ending of the book was very powerful.Powerful enough, that I'll read the sequel, The Gift of Asher Lev. Being a little less lucky isn't so bad after all.The beginning of my review is all the funnier to me, because I had already written that part (in my mind) but before writing it here, my brother wrote the comment you can see below. Apparently, it runs in the family to be jealous of those who can still look forward to unread Chaim Potok novels.
