I got four matching hardback books today:When We Were Very YoungNow We Are SixWinnie-the-PoohandThe House at Pooh Corner.I was going to put some ribbon around them and sell them as a set, but I got lost in reading The King's Breakfast (and loving Shepard's illustrations) aloud. I don't really want to sell the book now. I want to have kiddies come into the shop and on the pretext of perhaps making a sale from the parents reading the poems aloud. Most of the parents won't be impressed though, they prefer the Disney version ;-( And the kids - they are more into Peppa Pig and Doc McStuffins these days.The King askedThe Queen, andThe Queen askedThe Dairymaid:"Could we have some butter forThe Royal slice of bread?"The Queen asked the Dairymaid,The DairymaidSaid, "Certainly,I'll go and tell the cowNowBefore she goes to bed."The DairymaidShe curtsied,And went and told the Alderney:"Don't forget the butter forThe Royal slice of bread."The Alderney said sleepily:"You'd better tellHis MajestyThat many people nowadaysLike marmaladeInstead."The DairymaidSaid "Fancy!"And went toHer Majesty.She curtsied to the Queen, andShe turned a little red:"Excuse me,Your Majesty,For taking ofThe liberty,But marmalade is tasty, ifIt's veryThicklySpread."The Queen said"Oh!"And went to his Majesty:"Talking of the butter forThe royal slice of bread,Many peopleThink thatMarmaladeIs nicer.Would you like to try a littleMarmaladeInstead?"The King said,"Bother!"And then he said,"Oh, deary me!"The King sobbed, "Oh, deary me!"And went back to bed."Nobody,"He whimpered,"Could call meA fussy man;I only wantA little bitOf butter forMy bread!"The Queen said,"There, there!"And went toThe Dairymaid.The DairymaidSaid, "There, there!"And went to the shed.The cow said,"There, there!I didn't reallyMean it;Here's milk for his porringerAnd butter for his bread."The queen took the butterAnd brought it toHis Majesty.The King said"Butter, eh?"And bounced out of bed."Nobody," he said,As he kissed herTenderly,"Nobody," he said,As he slid downThe banisters,"Nobody,My darling,Could call meA fussy man -BUTI do like a little bit of butter to my bread!"
