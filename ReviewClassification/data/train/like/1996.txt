I just finished reading this famous - classic story. All this time I had no idea what it was about.What an interesting little book. I enjoyed reading in the same way that I have"Siddartha", by Herman Hesse, or "The Alchemist", by Paulo Coelho.It's a brilliant small book - especially knowing it was written so long ago: 1942..... but it's timeless.Is everything the same as everything else? Does it matter who we marry or if we marry? Does it matter if we live or die? Must murder have a meaning?Whose challenge is it when a person's behavior- is much less traditional than popular opinion? His? Or...everyone else around him?And who decides what is meaningful and purposeful in life anyway? Is it possible things are simply 'made up'.... and then we agree what is more important than something else?This book reminds me- "that life is a game". It is what it is. The game is how we play it:we add our beliefs - thoughts - feelings - choices. We 'add' meaning to "what is".Life is interpretation.... and Camus's main character, Meursault, doesn't blindly accept conventional meaning which is often impose on the world. He accepts his fate - yet not passively. He's clear he did something wrong. He's expecting others to be outraged. It accepts it all.So... we, the reader, are left to draw many of our own conclusions-or not -but we are certainly invited to take a look at the deeper meaning of life.Love the simple straightforward prose.....and personally I found Meursault charming and likable. I liked his strangeness!
