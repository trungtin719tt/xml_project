King Lear reflects the general tragedy of human suffering in the natural condition, with "Tragedy" serving like a mediation between suffering and nature. Every word in this play seems to carry such a profound meaning that I feel a bit tortured reading it. For example, what is behind the recurring word "natural"? It seems that every character uses it to convey totally different meanings: Lear, Gloucester, Edmund, Edgar all have a different interpretation of what should be considered "natural": Lear seems to consider nature as a higher order, while Edmund considers it as a earthly human order; Gloucester associates nature with amoral astronomical divinity, while Edgar is more moralist in his idea. Lear considers it natural to be loved by his daughters, while Regan and Goneril don't consider it natural or obliged to love their father, and Cornelia is too ambiguous (and somewhat creepy) for me to form an understanding of. And finally, the Fool, the childlike figure, seems to represent some natural condition of honesty, but his honesty seems loving and bitter simultaneously. However, despite all their different ideas of "nature", there is tragic suffering in all of them.Like Regan and Goneril, I find Edmund quite dangerously attractive, who, as an antithesis to Lear, is so dispassionate (not only to love but also to his own death) that he appears somewhat sexy. I don't consider him passionate about power, but he did assume the role of a prime mover and strive after it, but in the end, despite his Machiavellian human ambition and amoral treachery, he is back at the bottom of the wheel of Fortune.The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that it is so abstract that sometimes I feel detached from it. If I had a more powerful brain, it would definitely be a 5.
