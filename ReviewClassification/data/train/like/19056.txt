What would you do if everyone around you knew you were going to be killed but were doing nothing to stop this? For me, more than paranoia and terror would rake my mind. This is the premise of CHRONICLE OF A DEATH FORETOLD. The whole village knows that Santiago Naser is going to die by the hands of his wife's brothers. Their reason for killing him is simple: they believe he is to blame for their sister being returned after her marriage to a wealthy foreigner because she is not a virgin. As the story unfolds, and more and more people hear of the nefarious plans the brothers have to kill Santiago, the reader is brought into a world of magical realism by one of the masters. Gabriel Garcia Marquez is stupendous when mixing reality and what the reader perceives to be reality. There is also a wonderful romance encased in this murder story. When the murder does take place, the reader is left with a ghostly sensation of wondering if the brothers really wanted to kill Santiago, or if they had to kill him because the citizens of the town had come to expect them to kill him.HIGHLY RECOMMENDED
