The Schlegel sisters seemed like characters plucked straight out of aJane Austenbook, or books. Some combination of Emma Woodhouse (Emma) and the Dashwood sisters (Sense and Sensibility). But the story and the style are entirely Forster's. The focus of the story is the social class differences in English society. The setting is Edwardian Era England, sandwiched tightly between the end of the Victorian Era and the beginning of World War I. Most of Forster's novels were published in this 1st decade of the century. I have read them all and what strikes me is their easiness to read, and how different each one is to the other. This one, Howard's End, is considered his masterpiece, and who am I to disagree. 4.5 stars.
