WrensReads Review:So I don't really need to talk about how great this book is. That would be like me telling you how great any other great classic kid's story is.So what to say? I think this is a great story to realize you're a Grinch.It doesn't even have to be Christmas. Put in any other holiday.Valentine's Day: are you a "Single Awareness Day" person?Thanksgiving: are you a "Brown Thursday" person?Halloween: are you a "This is the Devil's Holiday" person?You get what I am getting at. Find your inner Cindy Lou Who. Love the holiday for what it is.Valentine's Day: love the people in your life!Thanksgiving: spend time with your family and your friends! Be thankful!Halloween: dress as someone else for the night and have fun!The Grinch is a all-around lesson for not being a party-pooper and just find the joy in the holiday. Don't be a fun-sucker and be fun and happy!WrensReads|Goodreads|Twitter|Instagram
