I finished this some time ago, but I wanted to mark it here as one of the highlights of the year. I consider Calvin and Hobbes my dear friends and I hope they are still having fun someplace with a lot of snow. I don't have a kid of my own, but if I did, I would surely buy this for his shelves (I borrowed mine from the Library)
