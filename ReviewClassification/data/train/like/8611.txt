This is my favorite of the Narnia books. I love how it begins, and especially how it ends. I enjoyed it immensely as a child, but as an adult it strikes a much deeper cord. The Christian allegory of these books is really summed up and finished here in a beautiful way. I really enjoyed all of Lewis' subtle hints about what he believes, and was surprised by how many things I agreed with. I love that the Taarkan is told that all who do good in the name of Tash are really doing it to Aslan, and those who do evil in the name of Aslan are really accepted by Tash.The only thing I didn't like was the loss of Susan- and her unwillingness to believe in Narnia anymore. But, I think that was also foreshadowed in Prince Caspian, and I think that Lewis had another point he was trying to make there, as well, about where our hearts and focus are in this life. So, even though it made me sad, I understood some of the reasoning behind it.
