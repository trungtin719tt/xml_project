This wasn't a book that my sister and I had in own our collection as kids, but my grandmother had a copy. We read it plenty of times while visiting her house!It's a silly story about a naive little bird who hatches from his egg while his mother is out collecting food. When he doesn't see her there, he goes off in search of her, asking various creatures and objects along the way the titular question. It's always funny when the bird moves on from asking animals to asking inanimate objects like airplanes and steam shovels if they're related; really, though, if you think about it, how would he know any better? (It's not like there was a mirror in that nest. He probably didn't even know what he was!)The illustrations are simple but fun. I especially like the mama bird with her little red headscarf.I hadn't read this in years (probably decades) but it's a classic that's held up pretty well. Today's kids are sure to get a giggle out of the baby bird's encounter with all his potential mothers... including the Snort!Quotable moment:
