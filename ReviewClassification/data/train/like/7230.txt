To write or not to write that's the question!So basically you read the play and your head is swarmed with so many things to say, to write but you don't know if you should or you could.There was a self interview with Tennessee Williams at the end of the book and he was talking about what he wanted to say in this book so now I'm confused because at the same time I as a woman and as a feminist find the women in this book a little, more than a little a lot misrepresented, they are weak, they can't defend themselves, they have no notion of what they're doing where they're going or who they are and they are tricked and misused and abused and mistreated by men especially the ones that are closest to them like their husbands or their brother in laws, so that's why Blanche says I depend on the kindness of strangers. I have a love-hate relationship with this sentence and the whole play but it's a very easy good lovely read and I personally like Tennessee Williams' writing.
