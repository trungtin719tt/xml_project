I bought this set for my boys a few Christmasses back - but really I bought it for me.I've read the entire thing a few pages at a time over the course of a some months and I was sad to come to the last wonderfully bound hard cover.Although I was sad to reach the end I also applaud Bill Watterson for knowing the power in ending something. He quit while he was ahead and left us something golden. It would lessen the work if he had carried on past the point the fire left him, repeating old themes too many times, and forcing us to watch as the life leached out of these beloved characters - perhaps even passing the torch on to contracted writers to continue milking the cash cow ad infinitum. But he didn't. Thanks Bill.Calvin and Hobbs captures a type of magic. The humour dances between many levels, brilliant visual comedy, erudite observation, poignant insight, laugh out loud slap-stick, and just damn feel-good stuff that touches everyone who has really lived.I fell into Calvin and Hobbes' world in my 30s and intend to keep dipping back in every time life gets me down.Go try it.Join my 3-emails-a-year newsletter #prizes.....
