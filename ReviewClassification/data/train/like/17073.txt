4.5 StarsContinuing on almost straight away from the novellaAlpha &amp; Omegain theOn the Prowlanthology, it shows Anna Latham, a rare and valuable Omega wolf following Charles Cornick the Marrocks (King of the Werewolves) youngest son to Montana to start a new life. Being an Omega means she can calm down the wolfside of a werewolf, giving peace to a species of volatile monsters, she in invaluable. But it is difficult to throw off three years of brutalization and fear and the new start isn't as smooth as she hoped, especially with a rogue werewolf killing so near the Marrock's territory.I have started this having just finishedRiver Markedthe latest in theMercy Thompson, I really wanted to know more about Charles, Anna and Bran, the Marrock. And although at this point I am still prefering the Mercy series, I really enjoyed this book.The main attraction of this book for me after reading the novella was seeing what would happen between Charles and Anna. They are both quiet and self contained people and I loved seeing them coming together and relying eachother, it was expediated by the plot as they are both thrown in to an extreme situation, but this just made it more exciting. What I was also was relieved to see was that their relationship felt different to Mercy &amp; Adam's, as much as I like the Mercy Thompson series I don't want to read the Alpha &amp; Omega series if it is really just the Mercy Thompson series in disguise.It was also a nice change to see more the one POV and I got a littletooexcited when I read my first Bran POV! Mt crush on Bran is definitely blooming into a full blown obsession. Although by the end I did feel sorry for Leah, even though I know she is a bitch, I certainly wouldn't want to be her. Did anyone else find that?A great start and I can't wait to read more.
