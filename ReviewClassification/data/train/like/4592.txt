I have always wanted to read a Stephen King but since am not into horror genre, I maintained a secure distance between me and books by one of the most famous authors. So when my friend recommended it to me I decided to finally read Mr. King and am glad that I read this.Story revolved around the inmates of Cold Mountain Prison who are there for murdering someone waiting for their death on Old Sparky, an Electric chair. Story is told by prison's warden Paul Edgecombe. Life was pretty much simple for the workers of prison until Delacroix, John Coffey and William Wharton came to Cold Mountain. Delacroix was mostly a cheerful man when his pet, a little mouse, was around. John Coffey was a quite man and Wharton was the troublemaker.I love how Mr. King has blended the lives of three inmates and in addition to that he also done justice to what workers of prisons go through business of execution of these inmates on Old Sparky. Sometimes it was tough for them and sometimes they just want to get over with this as it was deeply painful as most of the people were no longer what they were at the time of committing a crime.This book is categorized under "Horror" genre but I didn't find it anything like that. It was a beautiful story deeply touching and emotional.Thanks Vidya fo r recommending this book to me for two reasons, first it is a beautiful book and secondly for picking a King novel for me.
