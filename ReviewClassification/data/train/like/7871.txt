Since I love Scandinavian authors and review many Swedish and Norwegian novels, I'm often asked what the best language is if you're planning to read one in translation. It's early days yet, but I'm starting to feel more and more certain that the answer is German. Just likeKomet im Mumintal, which I read last year,Pippi Langstrumpfwas an absolute winner and felt 100% authentic. It was exactly like reading it in Swedish: the melody of the sentences was the same, the word-play was the same, and, most important, Pippi's voice was the same. In English, it somehow doesn't quite work, and she often comes across as bratty or insane. Here, the spell is never broken. She is the coolest, bravest, funniest person in the world; Tommy and Annika can't help loving her with all their little hearts, and neither could I. If you can't appreciate this wonderful book in the original, read it in German and you'll hardly miss anything at all.Heja Pippi! And, by the way, thank you for telling all those amazing barefaced lies. It's totally put me in the right frame of mind for writing the project proposal I'm supposed to be finishing this evening. I guess I'd better get back to doing that.
