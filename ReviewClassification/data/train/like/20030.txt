There are always a few things to keep in mind when delving into a Khaled Hosseini novel. First, and most important, is that you WILL have your heart broken, at least once, probably multiple times, and most likely within the first few pages. Second, Mr. Hosseini does not deal in neatly wrapped-up endings redolent of "Happily Ever After." His stories are more complicated than that; there's no instant gratification of happy, fulfilled characters riding off into the sunset, but the overall result is far more satisfying, and far more real.That being said, "And the Mountains Echoed" is positively beautiful. Each portion, told from a different point of view, is a perfect short story that can stand on its own, but intertwined, they make up a rich and intricate tapestry, the story of an Afghan family (and the people whose lives they touch) that spans six decades and three continents. It kept me up late, kept me from paying attention at work, and left me in a state that I am coming to associate with Mr. Hosseini's work: crying a little, smiling a little, and sorely tempted to simply flip back to the beginning of the book and start the entire experience over again.
