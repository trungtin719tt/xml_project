The monster at the end of this bookA metafictional analysis of the crushing dichotomy between who we want to be and who we really are, this book contains the entire agony of a disillusioned life in its chained pages. Stone's avatar is, cleverly, an idol of our youth, the inexplicable Grover. We find him in his youthful idealism, vowing to keep the monster he feels lurking in the world around him at bay. We track him through his heroic efforts to beat fate itself. We feel the inevitability of his defeat - the ending is writ in the title. But this is our childhood champion, our Super Grover! How can he lose? We expect a twist ending. Surely, he cannot fail.And then: the twist comes, but it's the twist of a dagger, as our protagonist realizes that he himself has always been the very thing he most fears.He is the monster. You are the monster. We...we are all the monster.
