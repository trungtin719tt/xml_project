Reread 2017:"When all is said and done, we do what we do for one another. For friendship. Not for country, not for patriotism, not because we're programmed killing machines, but because of the guy next to you. You fight for your friend, to keep him alive, and he fights for you, and everything about the army is built on this simple premise."When I first read Dear John- I was an optimistic, romantic teenager. I gave it 3 stars because I wasn't happy with it's ending, I wanted the happily ever after.Now I'm a more cynical 24 year old, and a lot of the issues and relationship troubles for John and Savannah resonate with me a lot more than they did for my younger, inexperienced self.I've upped my rating to 4 stars. Though I'm not a fan of the insta-love beginning, their relationship while John goes back into the army and thereafter is much more convincing, and real. At least to me.So heartbreaking though this story is; I enjoyed it more because it is believable, because things don't always go the way we plan, or even just the way we think. We are all just muddling along in this world, and if we find even a glimpse of the happiness this kind of love brings then we should think ourselves lucky, as it is usually fleeting."I also learned that it's possible to go on, no matter how impossible it seems, and that in time, the grief...lessens. It may not ever go away completely, but after a while it's not overwhelming."******************************************Original Review below - March 2012******************************************I'll be honest I struggled when reading Dear John.I loved the film, but when I tackled the book I found that I actually preferred the film (I know i'm sorry)There is little/no hope in this book for the two MCs. Now I like a sad tale as much as any pain loving masochist but this one hurt me greatly, mainly because we all know that is it unnecessary pain that could have been avoided!Now this is just me, and we all know we can't always get what we want, but I just wanted so much more for Savannah and John's relationship.It was heartbreaking, but more in the awful way than in a way I could willingly accept.
