Grabbed this when I learned it was published again. Already a fan afterThe Secret MagdaleneandFlow Down Like Silver: Hypatia of Alexandriaso I really wanted to read it. It was really worth it. A real snap crackle and pop through San Francisco's Chinatown. It's the Roaring Twenties. It's full of imported mobsters. And going behind the scenes of Chinese city life. Not to mention a terrific heroine whose character flaws are fascinating and ultimately a disaster for all. The writing is full of verve and wit. This was a first novel. As someone already said why didn't this hit the lists? With so much drivel out there, this one is a winner.
