I read this to preview for future class use, and I'm very enthusiastic about possibly using it as a whole-class read in the future. It's chockfull of great issues to be explored in class discussions and writing assignments. Best of all, it is a compelling story that will definitely engage even our more reluctant readers.In addition to that, I enjoyed it personally. Farmer creates a dystopian world that is believable due to the fact that it is based on so many of the issues we are dealing with today: illegal drugs, powerful drug cartels, illegal immigration, and cloning. It also addresses more universal themes such as the desire for acceptance, the effects of loneliness and isolation, the limits of love and loyalty, etc. Our kids would not find it hard, I believe, to make the connections between the themes in this book and those of the classic literature we read. We would also be able to explore these topics in more depth through non-fiction pieces during our research unit.Aside from the bounty of educational uses, it's just a great story that keeps you turning the pages! I'd like to read the sequel and see what happens next. That really says it all, doesn't it?
