It's so much darker when a light goes out than it would have been if it had never shone.It's official. Steinbeck is my favorite author. Next time you ask me, I swear that's what I'll stick with. This is a story about Ethan Hawley. He's a lowly grocery store clerk, who once owned the store. Everyone thinks he's a bum for having no ambition and for being content with what he does have; a family, self respect, ideals, morals. The Man finally gets him down and he buys into the American Dream, meaning every man for himself, look out for number one, get yours, etc... His life is altered. I always love how Steinbeck can preach it without seeming preachy. This book is still pretty relevant 50 some years later. Everyone is discontented. Nothing is ever enough. No one seems happy with what they have, and so we destroy our souls for stupid transitory stuff. Lots to mull over for me.
