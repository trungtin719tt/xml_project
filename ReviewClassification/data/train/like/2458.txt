What I like in this classic children's story is the illustrations and the rhyming which will be very entertaining to read for kids. I like the ending part where the children were thinking if they will tell their mother what happened while she was away.The lesson is very simple which is about honesty. But if we will see it in broader perspective, adults like teachers or parents who read this children's book to kids will also be reminded about it and to always practice it.
