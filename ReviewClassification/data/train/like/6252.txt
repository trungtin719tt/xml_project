HA! What a surprise!If you've seen the 1982 Blade Runner movie, you already know Deckard is a bounty hunter....works for law enforcement....and has a license to kill rogue androids aka replicants.DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEPwas the inspiration for the old movie as well as Blade Runner 2049 in theatre's now and is the same in some respects, but without the intensity and violence. It kind of has a strange calmness to it....almost like you've taken amood enhancer,and there's a wholeotherplot going on. Very bizarre.I don't want to be a"chicken-head"and give anything away so I'll just say....times are bleak, desperate and totally weird after W.W.T. (Word War Terminus) with people trying to survive on a contaminated earth....animals are a rare commodity....and most....those that have passedthe testhave defected to Mars.Definitely MOREthought provoking than the movie....Definitely NOTthe action-packed thriller with brutal fights between bounty hunter and a highly-intelligent &amp; dangerous species of replicant."You kill only the killers."
