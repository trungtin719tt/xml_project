What an amazing read, I enjoyed every page. Actually it will be really hard to rate this book as I feel I loved it but it wasn't as deep and tragically as most Spark's books usually are. I have been dying t read this book for years as I heard it was the only one with a HEA this author wrote. Well, I'm happy to tell you guys that's true. Not a single person dies in here which is usually how Spark's books go. This has pro's and con's. While I enjoyed everything being happy and nice, I missed those deep feeling Sparks usually makes me feel with his books. But it was a nice change. I did loved it, and I definitely recommend it. In my case, I just prefer his usual style and that's what I will be looking forward in the future, I guess when it comes to NS I enjoyed being tortured, maybe he has changed me into a bit of a masochist,LOL.Another thing I adore about this author is the way he writes, so many descriptions you can't help but to feel part of the story.In this book we get to read about a couple who has been married for 30 years and while they had an amazing marriage, with time it has become nothing as it used to be. With this book you'll face a harsh reality and something almost most couples get to go through with time. It was so fascinating to see them fighting to stay together, to see the love the have for one anther and how even though with time a person can screw it over and over it's still possible to make things better. Good things come with sacrifice, but they are always worth it, we just have to fight for them. Sparks takes us to everyday situations and makes us analyze them and understand things we give for granted. There's no other author that has his effect on me.Moreover, THE NOTEBOOK has been an all time fav for me, and I loved to see some of the characters again. Great read. I'm not giving 5 stars to it because I enjoy his other type of books better but definitely a book I would recommend.
