Given that Tolkien did not just invent a world, new creatures and weapons, but invented an actual freaking language, he gets 5 stars from me (I'm sure he was anxiously awaiting my approval). I could do without the 80 pages on tobacco production, but Tolkien wasn't writing a story; he was writing a history of a place that had never existed. I resisted reading them for years as I thought they were a level of dork I was not ready for. Then I saw the first movie and had to know what happened. I'm so happy I did (if I had only seen the movie's incredibly poor tactical decisions I would have thought Tolkien a moron). An incredible work.
