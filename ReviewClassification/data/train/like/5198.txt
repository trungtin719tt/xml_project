Here I am, looking at other reviews to figure out what genre this is. So, this is Gothic suspense? WOW! I was guessing mystery, but with so much atmosphere, it seeped into my bones! What an incredible book!This was a 15 hour audio book, and due to life circumstances, I was not able to listen continuously. What I can say is that every time I listened, I was completely drawn into another world.It is the story of a famous recluse writer, Vida Winters. She is an invalid now, but has one final tale to tell. One that was missing from a previous book which stated it had thirteen tales, but only contained twelve. And so, it is a tale the world has been waiting to hear. Her choice of a biographer is that of an unknown bookstore owner, one who she has sent a letter, one who simply receiving any letter is an event. Could their lives be connected in unknown ways? All of the mysteries in this book expand, the layers go deeper. It was impossible not to follow each word through every door. And that's exactly what it felt like. The writing is so exquisite that I would follow it anywhere.The book begins, "You want to know someone heart, mind and soul? Ask him to tell you about where he was born. What you get won't be the truth. It will be a story, and nothing is more telling than a story." And so, Vita Winters is enticing me with story, stating, "a good story is always more dazzling than a broken piece of truth." But, the truth has become a bully in her mind. It must be told.I loved this story so much I will be buying the book. I must have those words in writing, for they are truly...dazzling!
