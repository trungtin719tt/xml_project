Very entertaining.The beginning was depressing. A lot of bad things happen to Tracy in jail. I was disappointed with the stupid things she did that landed her in jail. But after she got out of jail, the book really took off and was enjoyable. My favorite part was the way Tracy got revenge against mafia guys. After that I enjoyed watching her plan and pull off con jobs and thefts.The audiobook narrator Nancy LaScala was good in parts, but not good in some ways. Sometimes her general narration voice was too wooden, not engaging and interesting. And sometimes she spoke too fast like she was in a hurry.DATA:Narrative mode: 3rd person. Swearing language: mild.
