I am always surprised by J.K. Rowling's ability to make her books an allegory of our modern world and it's big and hideous problems. We all know, after all, that she covered discrimination, wars, hate crime, the Kardashians, etc.Let's take this book for example. Harry goes back to Hogwarts. Now enter Gilderoy Lockhart. A fame enamored charlatan, who knows nothing about anything, except memory spells. So clearly a Kardashian. Now some might ask: do Kardashians know memory spells. And the answer is clearly YES! Keeping Up with the Kardashians is already on Season 13, so some magic must be at work, otherwise you'd have to think the world has gone mad!!!!!Carrying on, Harry has an awful year, mostly because of the fact that he can talk snake language. Actually all of Harry's life is an allegory about fame and how it can easily destroy you, hence Harry might've been modeled after Lindsay Lohan. But Rowling had to give a moral to the story and because of that Harry ended up fine in the end... mostly.And to crown all of this awful year, he meets Tom Riddle, who is the heir of Slytherin. He also speaks snake language and has a giant serpent for a pet. So definitely a forefather of Taylor Swift. And look at what that those family ties made her do!! Lessons to be learned from here, people!Now, of course, a lot of questions remain: will the Kardashians magic still work for long? Will Taylor have a nose job so she could resemble her grandpa? Will I finish this review already?Only time can tell...
