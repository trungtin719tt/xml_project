So this is the third time I read this Stephen King classic. The first time, I was a teenager and I just didn't *get* it like I got it the second time, which was Christmas of 2015. That time really blew me away. Especially how emotional this read was. I didn't remember crying so much the first time, but then as a mother--everything was just on a whole new level of fear--not a fear of the supernatural or paranormal, ghosts, monsters, not that kind of fear but the fears you only experience as a parent watching your children walk around like pieces of your heart that have left your body and could be broken or taken from you at any moment.THAT kind of fear.This book is a masterpiece. The character development of Louis Creed is other level writing. He feels so real to me. Jud and Norma too. Even Rachel, who I've come to dislike.If you're new to Stephen King and don't really know where to start, this would be an awesome stepping stone. It's the perfect example of the storytelling King is capable of and it has all the horror you could possibly want. It's the full package.
