One point docked for a less than stellar pace of the last third. Otherwise it's a feast for the eyes and a delight for the senses.The Goldfinch is about maturity and picking up the pieces when life lets you down. Going on with your life when the portal to hell is opened, is a daunting task.Theo, the hero of this book (kinda), is traveling away from his demons, trying to cobble together enough positive images to keep his sanity intact. He is stabbed, sometimes in the back.In the end I would recommend The Goldfinch because it's a different book from its contemporaries. It's deep and wise and has respect for the abilities of its readers. People need to read it once at least.
