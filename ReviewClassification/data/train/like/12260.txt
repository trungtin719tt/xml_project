An expert, uproarious parallel play of two extremely astute yet heartwarming consciousnesses! There are so many quotable lines here, observations that are immeasurably insurmountably profound. It is a book of paradigms, life lessons, needle point philosophies arriving from two different backgrounds. The Point: no matter where you are from, you can attain an envious intelligence &amp; plenty a poetic articulation.About the plot must be simplified by simpler minds (my own, etc.) as: la femme francois version of the English novel by Nick Hornby (&amp; the adorable film with Hugh Grant it spawned) "About a Boy." (Although the two main protagonists don't reference each other til after the first half of the book.) Refined &amp; elegant (doi!), the novel astounds! You will very likely want to reread this one once again in your lifetime...
