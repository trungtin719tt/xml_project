I typically stay as far away from romance novels as I can but I got "bitten" (okay ... bad pun) by the Twilight Series. I started reading them because I needed a book-fix after the last Harry Potter book (may the Harry Potter series rest in peace). The first in the Twilight series, appropriately named "Twilight", is pretty good but not Stephenie Myer's best writing. With each addition in the series, her writing gets better and better. I read the last book and started getting geared up for the movie. A friend at work told me about the partially completed draft of "Midnight Sun" being leaked so I went to Meyer's website to see what happened. Yep! Someone (LOSER) leaked a version of it. Meyer decided that, for now and indefinitely, she is so upset about the leak that she can't write any more in the book. (THANK YOU, afforementioned LOSER!) She made an interesting move, though, to save her readers' honor and uploaded the unfinished manuscript to her website herself. No one has to feel guilty looking for it and reading it, because she's taken the high road and freely given it. I started reading it, not expecting to be bitten hard enough to become a wannabe vampire myself! Wow! Midnight Sun is the best book in the series and it isn't even officially part of the series! I found myself swooning like a teenage girl -- okay, like Bella herself -- and wanting Edward to fall in love with ME! I'm pathetic, I know, but that's okay. We all need a little nibble of romance every now and then!
