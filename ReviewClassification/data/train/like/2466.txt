I read this the first time when I was a child and I remember being so amazed at the whimsical humor of the book. I enjoyed reading it as an adult to my children, and this week I had the joy of reading it to my grandson for his first time. I will always remember his eyes widening at the illustrations.A wonderful book aimed at children but enjoyable for even adults to read. One of my all-time favorites.
