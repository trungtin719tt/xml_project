I can't tell you the number of times I read this as a kid.And as an adult before I had kids.And now I've read it aloud to my kids and realized: It's kind of a slow burn. Also, there is a lot about using your imagination, and the importance of stories, and having an inner life to make up for your outer one being terrible. Which was a bit boring to my kids to listen to, but was very pleasing to young writer me, and to adult writer me as well.
