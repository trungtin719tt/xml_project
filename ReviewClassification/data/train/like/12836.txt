This book isexceptional. It will take months to digest what I've just read. Toni Morrison weaves so many brilliant elements into her work that I'm tempted to seek out professional literary analysis to help me understand the allusions and powerful strands of meaning shot throughout. And by powerful, I mean POWERFUL - her words can take flight, can break chains, can rhapsodize and destroy in equal measure.Ultimately there are themes at work here which depict flight (escape), though every attempt seems to end in tragedy, whether it's Robert Smith's hospital leap in chapter one, or Solomon's legacy, or Jake's own flight (five feet into the air at the receiving end of a dead shot), or Milkman's own flight from Michigan. And what of ginger? Is it symbolic of roots and healing, therefore of a kind of heart's homecoming? Why does Milkman smell it when Pilate opens the bag of bones, or when he enters Circe's house? It's a kind of mythical yellow brick road that seems to be guiding him towards the lost strands of his family tree. Death and life, burial and flight, these are the pervading themes. Women and men, and the strong tethers that bind together siblings, parents, lovers, in all of their devastating and life-affirming ways, that gut us and kills us and bury us and smother us and resurrect us. The hunter and the hunted, Hagar and Milkman, the Virginians and the bobcat, Guitar and Milkman, the Deads and that gold, Circe and her Weimaraners, the tenants and their Dead landlord - we are all in endless pursuit.And that sentence, "everybody wants the life of a black man" - and those speeches, Milkman's, Guitar's, those speeches that just ache with truth, but bear zero sentiment... I just can't even convey how powerful thislanguageis, and that the language fuels powerfulideasjust makes this one hell of an incredible book to be treasured and discussed for decades to come.
