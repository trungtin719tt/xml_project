I loved this story.For the Fifty and Beautiful Disaster lovers out there, you will love this book because it has a very similar feel and flow to it. A hopelessly flawed hero, Gideon, and heroine, Eva, enter into a relationship eclipsed by false starts, petty jealousies, misunderstandings, and bruised trust. The story was beautifully written from Eva's POV but the angst of both characters and their associates was palpable throughout the entire book.In Bared to You, Eva's(view spoiler)[ sexual abuse from her stepbrother is revealed. We are provided with clear clues that Gideon has also been sexually abused and we can glean that it occurred in his mothers home. However, we are given no additional details in this story. Just that is is severely flawed. I loved the depth of the characters, primary and secondary. Cary is also so drastically flawed emotionally and sexually that you root for him and Trey to make it and are sadly disappointed when Cary's bi-insatiability causes them to break up.(hide spoiler)]Ms. Day definitely wrote a highly emotionally charged story. This book will most likely be part of a triadic series, and the next bookDeeper in Youis slated to come out sometime in October.VisitThe BookChick Blog
