It's the Bible, aka God's Word, aka the best and most influential book ever written. What more do I need to say?EDIT: This is my umpteenth time reading through the Good Book in a year's time...and I plan on doing it again next year and every year after that!ANOTHER EDIT: My church declared 2018 the year of the Bible, and encouraged us all to do a yearly reading plan that ended today; I just completed it minutes ago! Lord willing, I'll do a (different) yearly plan in 2019...and as long as I'm alive and able to do so!
