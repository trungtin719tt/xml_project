My full review, as well as my other thoughts on reading, can be found onmy blog.Although famous for focusing upon a single day in the life of one woman,Mrs. Dallowayin fact ricochets from one interior life to the next, collapsing the present into the past as it does so. The novel is far less interested in defining Clarissa Dalloway as an individual than in exploring the many-sided effects she has on an assortment of others; by the end of the narrative, Woolf has offered her readers not a neat portrait of a personality but several impressionistic sketches of the same subject. Woolf's multifaceted characterization successfully thwarts attempts to sum up Mrs. Dalloway or to reduce her to her relationship with any one person. Likewise, the author's elaborate but accessible prose resists careless reading, forcing her readers to approach the short novel deliberately.Mrs. Dallowaywas Woolf's first success at writing experimental long fiction, and it remains the perfect introduction to her mature work.
