We stopped reading after the first 100 pages. We have listened to an audio book that I think must have been an unabridged reading of the book, as we feel that we know the story completely and reading the book isn't bringing anything new for us. As we have many books on our to read shelf at the moment we are going to put this on hold and perhaps return later.
