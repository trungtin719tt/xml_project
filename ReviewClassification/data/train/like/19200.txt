A terrific read. Full of dash and color. San Francisco's one of my favorite cities in all the world. This story gets into places you could never see as a tourist, and barely see as a native. It has a fascinating heroine, a fascinating love triangle, the mysterious death of Harding, at the time the President of the United States with the Teapot Dome Scandal about to burst over his head. Best of all it has gangsters vs a Chinese Tong. The leader of the Tong is just about the sexiest man I've ever met in a book. Oh, if he were real. Wonderful book. I miss it already.
