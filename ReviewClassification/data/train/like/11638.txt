I'm not exactly sure how to rate this book. But I have a sneaking suspicion that I might read it again at some point, which is generally my personal line for four stars.I picked this up as one of the books on the BBC's Big Read list, which I am slowly making my way through. I am not sure what to make of it.Note: The rest of this review has been withdrawn due to the changes in Goodreads policy and enforcement.
