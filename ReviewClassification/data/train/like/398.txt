The only good pig is a dead pig.Yeah, yeah, everyoneclaimsOrwell wrote this as about the Russian Revolution, Stalin, and the rise of Communism.Pshttt. Whatever.You know what I think he was really saying?Beware the Other White Meat!Ok, maybe not.Look, I know what you're thinking,That pig looks adorable!, but the next thing you know, that piggy is all grown up and stealing your cookies!And you'll let it steal your cookies because Mr. Pig has convinced you that giving up yourcookiesevery day was a part of the original agreement! Besides, what do you know, you're just a stupid sheep...Plus, it's just a cookie, where's the harm?Not to mention, the last guy who complained about giving up his cookie ended up mauled by that dog. Probably just a coincidence, though.Right?But it's ok because pigs are smart. That's what everyone says, right? Smarter thanyouare, at any rate. And if the pig says it's ok, then it's ok.I mean look at it! It couldn't possibly have anything but your best interests at heart!Alright, I'm outta pig gifs.So, I thought this was a pretty cool book. Sure, it's supposed to be about Russia, but it could just as easily be about the working class inmycountry.Bottom line?We need to stop listening to the spin doctors on the boob tube and start thinking for ourselves. Question everything, especially the things we think weknoware true. Itmightbe a good idea to teach our kids that it's ok not blindly believe everythingwetell them, too. Besides, if we're right, then our ideals can stand up to the scrutiny of children. Otherwise, we risk raising a generation of idiots.Oh! I found one more pig gif!
