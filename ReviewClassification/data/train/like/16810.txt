This book really surprised me. Ben Peller takes a departure from the humorous tone of the past two "To Live" books and really confronts some serious issues. With all that's going on in the world... revolutions, protests, the young rising up... this book is very "well-timed" indeed. Shawn Michals confronts not only himself but an oppressive government on an Island that could exist anywhere. Very good stuff.
