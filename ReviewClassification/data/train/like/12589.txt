A children's book I read for a Challenge and what a treat it was! Beautifully written, delightful characters, a bittersweet story. No wonder it won awards.The Winn-Dixie of the title is big sook of a stray dog who comes into 10 year old Opal's life at a time when she needs a friend. Her mother is gone, her father works too hard, they have just arrived in a new town and she has no one. Winn-Dixie however is great at making friends and over the course of the book Opal's life turns around.Of course there are lessons to be learned in acceptance of life and of other people. DiCamillo shows not tells in exactly the right way.This book is a little gem and I am very glad I came across it. Discovering such treasures unexpectedly is the reason I find challenges rewarding:)
