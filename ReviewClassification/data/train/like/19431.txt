This series had to be one of the best I have EVER read. There are six to the full set, and I loved them all! Completed under two weeks, they are that good.If you love vampires, and you love to be able to connect with the characters, feel what the characters feel, then this series is PERFECT for you.Lissa and Rose have to be the best people ever, you get so much from them. Their romances with the men they love just make you feel as though you could be part of it all!Rose has the forbidden romance going on... and I'll tell you what, I love it! It just pulls you into the book even more! The feeling of something forbideen yet one hundred percent right. It just makes you connect with the characters to well!I think the age range for this must be the teens... It's got teen drama, everything a teen has to cope with during the few years we are truly finding ourselves. So, 13-17 maybe? But anyone older can read, I just think the teens would connect more, but everyone is sure to love the book. I did anyway!READ IT, ITS WELL WORTH IT!!!!!!!-Paige'xo
