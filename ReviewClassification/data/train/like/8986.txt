Surprising. Delightful. Beautiful. Real.The first time I read through Mortal Instruments, I wanted to skip ahead as much as possible to know what was going on with main character's Clary and Jace but slowly, the whole world Clare has created pulled me in to stay.Cocky, venerable, passionate, and of course attractive, Jace is one of my favorite male leads in teen fiction. His personality shines through in it's complexity. I found myself literally laughing out loud from some of the things that flew out of his mouth.Brave, brash, and modest, Clary comes in as a fascinating strong female lead in the Mortal Instruments series.Clare does a brilliant job with her story-world. It's complex, expansive, and solid which is a MUST in magical realism. Thankfully, I found the world of the angles leaking into my every day life much like Harry Potter. I want to experience everything Clare has written because I've fallen in love with her well-crafted world, intelligently hilarious characters, and style of expression.This series deserves way more hype than it's gotten so far. I demand that there will be a second movie produced.
