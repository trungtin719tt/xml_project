Oliver Twist is the first novel in English that focused entirely on a child as the protagonist. He is also known for the unromantic way Charles Dickens described the criminals and their sordid lives. In Olivier Twist, one of his best-known novels, Dickens condemns the comic but also the bitterness of the effects of industrialization in 19th century England. Oliver, an innocent child, is curled up in an unscrupulous society where, partly because of the recent Poor Laws, he can only practically choose between the asylum of the poor, the hideout of Fagin's thieves, a condemnation of imprisonment or an early death. From this bitter industrial / institutional framework, however, a fairy tale emerges: in the midst of corruption and degradation, Oliver, who by nature is essentially passive, perseveres a pure heart. He abstains from evil when everyone around him falls and, as one might expect in a fairy tale, he receives his reward, just as all his persecutor-thieves receive his reward. In anticipation of this happy event, Dickens seizes this opportunity and then explores the kind of life an orphan, an outcast might have to live in London during the 1930s.
