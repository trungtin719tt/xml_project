Oh, how I love this book! It wasn't planned that I wanted to read this book. I had seen it once or twice, but I dind't really came through to me, but one day (I was in need of books at the time) I saw it in a store. It was cheap, it was a nice cover, and it didn't sound that bad. I thought to myself it probably could be worse.And boy, how I loved this book from the first chapter!Kylie Galen is a girl with several problems: parents, whom are getting a divorce, a dead grandmother and a stalker and her boyfriend just recently broke up with her. She didn't had a perfect life, and it's something that really applies to me. Kylie is a character you easily love, and I love how she reacts when she is told what really is going on with her.Besides of being a loveable character, she surrounds herself with two amazing guys - Derek and Lucas. And after reading the book, I must admit, I love Lucas most. Her roomies is both nice and I love their fight, it's a nice touch to the book. The story Della told about her and Lee really touched me.Anyway, the book is amazing, and because of the amazing characters, the good storyline and the awesome story in general, I can look past the mistakes in the translation to Danish. Love the book. Can't wait to number two!
