Most Nicholas Sparks' books are tear jerkers and heartbreaking, I just didn't expect this one to make me cry a little. It's more of happy tears than sad ones. I'm just incredibly touched with the story.Noah Calhoun's words helped Wilson Lewis to become a better man to his wife, Jane. Realizations of how much time he lost because he's too busy at work and doesn't pay much attention to his family. Wilson made a mistake of forgetting their wedding anniversary and hurts Jane's feelings. To make up for it, he prepared something special on their next anniversary. .The ending is just really sweet in my opinion. I really like it.
