This book covers everything that could be asked for in a novel of its type, it has extensive and believable action, the characters have depth and believability with a true sense of reality running through every page, the plot is a mind blowing reality of the true human condition and how it is affected by extreme circumstances. The emotions and character connections that are found in the book are far beyond anything I have ever read and I am yet to find a story that manages to be as complex in story line and character creation while at the same time being as easy to follow and be so addictive. This is a MUST read for anyone who wants to delve their minds in to the worlds criminal underworld and feel the sharp edge of empathy towards characters that are bound to stay in memory for a very long time to come. Verdict: outstanding!!
