I think this is my favourite Watch book to date which is a bit bizarre because most of the Watch as we know it wasn't in it. I'm always a bit tense about predestination time paradoxes but Terry Pratchett is a safe pair of hands. Vimes has come a long way since Guards Guards. this was just a pleasure to read.
