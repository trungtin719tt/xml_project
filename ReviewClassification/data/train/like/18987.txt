Update After 2017 Reread:I still absolutely love this first book! It is a solid start to what is most likely going to be an amazing series. However, I disagree with former me's review (down below). I think I was still high on the adrenaline of the finale while reading that, because, personally, it is not better than Clockwork Princess. I mean, that was averybold statement. What was I thinking? It's amazing, but nothing can come to Clockwork Princess (not yet).Original Review:My favorite Cassandra Clare book so far,includingClockwork Princess. I KNOW.It wasn't just a war between the good guys vs. the evil villain, but was an action-packed mystery filled with family, friends, magic, murder, and forbidden love. WOWZA!I loved how different every character felt. Especially how Ty, Mark, and Arthur had complex and different ways of thinking and dealing with issues. I'm so happy that Cassandra Clare wrote about mental illnesses in the Shadowhunter community and why we haven't really seen it so far in any of her other books. I also am happy that Julian, the love interest, wasn't like all of the other love interests that we've seen so far in her books: jokey and sarcastic. Julian was much more mature than the others because of circumstances beyond his control and seemed much more grounded. The way he took care of the kids *SWOON*. He's definitely my second favorite of the Cassandra Clare men so far (Will Herondale will never be usurped let's be honest.)There's so much left that I want to talk about, but I'm going to leave those things for my video review, which will come soon to my channel!
