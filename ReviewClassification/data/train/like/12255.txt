My heart!! I was introduced to Dean Koontz decades ago when I first read Watchers. I decided it was time to finally reread my favorite novel of his and now I'm experiencing all kinds of feels.I've been a huge fan of his ever since originally reading this and I'm pretty sure I've read every book he's released since. Yes, Dean's books are horror books, but I feel that they are more love stories and define the goodness of people. No matter how evil the characters or creatures are, there are the people who are the good ones.In Watchers, we didn't just get good people, we got an amazing dog!! Being a huge animal lover, especially dogs, I fell in love with Einstein the golden retriever all over again. This book is, and will always be, my favorite of Dean Koontz's!
