Very short review due to the glitches on GR.This is the second book in the trilogy. I loved it and I loved the movie. The book bogs down a little but it's all good.Lisbeth is back and doing her own thing.Lisbeth has been away from Mikael for some time. But, they come back together when Lisbeth is accused of killing that jerk rapist of hers.*****Spoiler*****Lisbeth looks into a sex trafficking ring that Mikael is involved in and finds out some things about her past she didn't want to know.Her evil arse father is alive and she has a brother and they need to be taken out.But this almost gets her killed.Thank God Mikael was able to find her!
