(Is it just me or Milers really look stoned here*kidding*)Amazing book, it's kind of emotional and depressing in the end but still it has a happy ending. Ronnie was like a character that I can personally relate to and the dialogues are just humorous. It's kinda like predictable but all in all it's really meaningful and highly recommended to all Sparks fans.
