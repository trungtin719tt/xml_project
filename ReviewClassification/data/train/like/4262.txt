Fantastic book! C. S. Lewis' first "novel" (actually Pilgrim's regress was first but it's a rather oblique allegory). It was and still is a best seller. I can recommend it to Christians and non-Christians alike. It's full of (yes I know it's a cliche, but here it's just true) "wit and wisdom". You'll see yourself and everyone else you've ever known well. You'll see situations that come up in everyday life. I recommend it highly!This is probably my second favorite novel by Lewis...after The Great DivorceThe Great Divorce, and rates up there in my favorite books of all time list.Okay...did you get that I like it? :)
