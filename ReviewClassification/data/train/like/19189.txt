Take a spoiled brat, throw her into a world she can't control, add wonderful writing, a wonderful setting, a host of colorful characters, a time in our history that fascinates (me, anyway), early jazz, early newspapers, an actual mystery in the to-this-day unexplained sudden death of the President of the United States, Warren G. Harding -- a doofus very like George W. Bush, mix it all up and you get this wonderful book.
