More of the rich storytelling and compelling research that Ki Longfellow brought to her previous book, "The Secret Magdalene". Unlike "Magdalene", "Flow Down Like Silver" is told through, not one, but several 1st-person witnesses - Hypatia herself, plus intimates and acquaintances of the legendary mathematician/philosopher during the latter half of her life. This approach tempers a bit of the reader's emotional empathy for the principal character, offering in its place the intimate perceptions of several who came within her sphere of influence. (This parallels our own awareness of the historical Hypatia - we know of her only through references in writings of her contemporaries.) Hypatia is portrayed as a lovely and guileless intellectual with a streak of heroic stubbornness. Her existential example of a life lived with integrity and authenticity provokes equal parts admiration and fear in those who encounter her.5th century Alexandria becomes as much a character in this tale as any one individual, much as 1st-century Palestine came so alive in The Secret Magdalene. The principal conflict between the tolerant, intellectual, even skeptical, agnosticism represented by Hypatia, and the reactionary intolerance of the disenfranchised yet rising Christian sects offers obvious and troubling parallels with today's world.The story leaves us with the intriguing possibility (and for me, a fervent hope) that Hypatia's own writings, and perhaps books of the once great Library, are waiting somewhere under the Egyptian desert to one day be recovered.
