It was only when I finished reading the book did I get to know that it was based on a true story. The sequel might be worth reading too.Such tragedy followed by sweet tales worthy of Mowgli, but what indubitably would have been a life of work and loneliness. I thought that since the beginning the author wanted to share his story with people of all ages, and it shows.Karana was a transparent character, by which I mean we know all her thoughts. Yet we don't know her reasons for her acts of mercy towards the animals on the island. We do get an explanation, but still the adventures of a survivor lend themselves to tragedy, loneliness and instinct.
