This was perfect! Everything about it. The only thing I would change about it is maybe making it like 2 times thicker, because I need MOOOORE. Right now! I'm going through some really weird withdraws, because I need Aaron Warner. I used to dream of a character like him, desperately hoping someone would materialize it, and I must say, Taherah. You did an amazing job.I am so happy that this happened. I just want to scream out everything that happened but it's all super spoilery. So I'll just talk about Juliette's awesome transformation for a sec.I wasn't necessarily a fan of her, I only really liked her when she was with Warner, because she would get all sassy and break through walls and doors and stuff. But when she was with Adam she was mushy and would blink and blush all the time. I was in a constant state of over dramatic eye rolling.But in Ignite Me, she was.... Just..... Awesome. Like everything Warner was trying to convince her she could be, she was becoming. And it was an amazing transformation to watch. She wasn't letting anyone tell her that she couldn't, because she was going to do this regardless.Juliette becoming her own person, also brought out this supportive, amazing-man, side of Warner that just melted me. All he wanted was to be there to witness her amazing ness, and he had all the faith in the world, that she could do whatever it was that she wanted to do.Oh gosh I need to reread this but I can't stop my overflow of emotions right now. And Adam supporters, this is all I have to say to you:Chapter 55
