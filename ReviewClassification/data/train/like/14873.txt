Thoughtless....the perfect description for Keira! This is where the book looses a star for me.I don't think anyone could truly be that naive! Did she really think that cuddling, holding hands and flirting innocently (is that even really a thing!) would not eventually lead to something and that the guy wouldn't eventually want more!I REALLY am not a fan of this girl! Selfish would be another word.But Kellan. Poor poor tormented Kellan. If you were a Travis fan (Beautiful Disasterthen I think Kellan is his long last brother!! I gotta be honest, he could do so much better.And poor Denny, the poor guy didn't do anything wrong but love her &amp; trust her. Misplaced trust as it turns out. *shakes head*But seriously the writing in this book had me sitting on the edge of my seat, I nearly felt as torn up as Kellan did. You feel every kiss, every heated moment, every argument.I had said to myself that I wouldn't go straight intoEffortlessbecause I couldn't take anymore angst for a while &amp; also that Thoughtless finished kinda perfect....but yet here I am 20% into it LOL.So in conclusion if, like me, you lovedBeautiful Disasteror enjoyed the likes ofThe Vincent Boysthan this is the book for you.
