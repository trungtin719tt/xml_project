This is sometimes recommended as a good starting place for people who are looking to enter into discworld. I would agree with this if you're the type of person who doesn't need to continue on with the same characters from one book to the other. If you're looking for the style of Pratchett, but you just want a taste without getting into any major character arcs and just want his wit and wisdom this is your book.The premise is that Gods only have as much power as the people allow - and this is a central them throughout Discworld. The more people that believe in you as a God, the more powerful and well known you'll be. Another Discworld book with this theme would be Hogfather which focuses on Santa Claus kind of thing.Although my enjoyment level for this book was a 4.1 - I am a person who wants to hear more about my favorite characters over a tight literary story in the same universe - I need to rate this a 5. This is probably one of the stronger novels he's written and it gets many people interested in Discworld who wouldnt have been otherwise.
