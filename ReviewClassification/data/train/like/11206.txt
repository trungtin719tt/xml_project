I LEARNED SO MUCH........I'm moved - deeply moved......at this 'book' and 'partly' at myself. SOMETHING HAS SHIFTED INSIDE ME THROUGH THIS READING EXPERIENCE. A handful of books have done this for me --but not usually 'two' in a very short period of time! But..... I can't deny what's so.SNAP CRACKLE POP....... BOOKS THAT CHANGE OUR THINKING - OUR ACTIONS - MUST BE REMEMBERED..... this is another one of those books!!!!!!A light switch is turned 'on' in my brain for the first time in almost 65 years. I haven't been reading biographies about past Presidents. I have some natural interest in Kennedy - Lincoln - and - Obama -- but I've never been the girl to run to the history or political sections in book stores... seeking out past Presidents to read about. WHY THE HECK HAVEN'T I? Fear of boring dry reading?? It's amazing how shallow and small my thinking is sometimes.Has anyone else ever cried when coming 'nose-to-nose' with your own stupidity- laziness- and/or shame for allowing yourself to be ignorant? Really angry at yourself? I've been reading this book for 4 to 6 weeks ( other books too), but a couple of weeks ago I broke down: cried like a baby ..... facing the reality of HOW MUCH I DON'T KNOW.At the same time ....,I WAS FASCINATED WITH THIS BOOK - THIS STORY -I'm left wanting to explore more!!!! Hallelujah! :)John Adams worked his ass off LONG HOURS A DAY - RISKING HIS HEALTH - making constant sacrifices and contributions with the most humble heart!! A GREAT MAN!!!I've read my share of the "The dreaded multiple POV novels". I'm discovering it's possible that reading historical books about past Presidents might 'not' be drudgery or work any more than it's been to read about Jack or Libby taking turns narrating every other chapter. If more books about past Presidents are 'this good'.... ( good storytelling), I have nothing to fear!I FEEL LESS RESISTANCE TO READ ABOUT MORE PAST PRESIDENTS!!! ....That's what's shifted!!! I'm ready to read another, and another! Ha ha .... we certainly have plenty of past presidents to choose from!!! :)JOHN ADAMS - inspired me!!!! His character was outstanding!!Were all Presidents this honest, 'loving' toward his wife and children, down to earth, decent, .....really decent? He was bright - worked hard. Model integrity.I didn't think of him as a politician. I can't imagine Trump ever saying these word...."I only wish I were better qualified" .....John AdamsOhhhhhh, and Abigail.... did you not love this woman???? Up at 5am to begin her day... taking care of the needs of their family and home. - running a farm during war - loss of children while her husband was away -sadness - loneliness- missing her partner -She was a courageous independent woman ahead of her days.I knew nothing about John Adams relationship with Thomas Jefferson. Friends, ......then enemies, then friends again.John Adams and Thomas Jefferson 'both' died on July 4, 1826, ---same day!!!! Blows my mind!!!John Adams lived longer than any other American President. I wonder if it was all that Apple cider he drank every day. :)Question to those who are history buffs? Suggestions of 'which' President I might read about next? A few suggestions? And by whom?Wonderful book.... great opening for meMuch thanks goes to David McCullough!!!!
