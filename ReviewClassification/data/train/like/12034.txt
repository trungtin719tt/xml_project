*4.5 stars*MAN, THESE BOOKS ARE AWESOME.I'm really loving The Lunar Chronicles so far !The writing, the plots, the characters... everything about these books is EPIC basically .I wrote a 5-star review a while back on Cinder (The first book) . And everything i said over there is completely relevant to Scarlet.In this book, we are introduced to Scarlet( obviously ), as we follow her journey of looking for her grandmother who was missing.What's really cool, is that we still get to follow Cinder's story(and learn more about her past), untill her path collides with Scarlet's in an epic-action packed event ! .I, personally didn't find the new perspective added to the story(Scarlet's) distracting at all .In fact, it was a refreshing change , and i can't wait to meet new characters and see how things unravel in the next book!Oh and,#TEAMIKO
