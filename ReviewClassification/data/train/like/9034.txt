"Forgive them, for they know not what they do"I love that quote. It is said nearing the end of this book, and it sums up how I should feel about a couple of characters in this book. I'm glad that Phillip was more forgiving.I'll be frank, I went into "Of Human Bondage" completely blind, and the reason this book attracted me so much was the title. I thought I was going to be reading some sexy victorian novel, but I was definitely mistaken on that front. With my mind actively curious, I just dived straight in, and I'm happy to say, I have not been left disappointed.This book is an autobiographical account of the authors life. Some parts have been altered, for example, Philip having a clubfoot, but it is mostly a true account. The story begins at Philips early days, where he is at school, and this part is probably the dullest part of the book. It is tiresome, and I was itching for him to leave school, so something would actually happen, in order to keep me invested in the plot.Later, Philip meets and falls in love with a girl called Mildred. It is obvious to the reader that Mildred has no love for him, and she freely uses him, time and time again. I had pity for Phillip, but, I also felt an intense feeling of how pathetically ridiculous it all actually was. Doting on a being that obviously has no love for you is pretty low. He fell for her wicked traps way too often, and I really wanted to grab Phillip firmly by the shoulders, and shake him!Yes, Mildred was a vile creature.Misogyny was present here, which really was kind of laughable, as it took me completely by surprise. I understand that it was probably the attitudes towards women at the time, but it still doesn't stop me from saying how wrong it was, and still is, unfortunately.There are many human lessons in this classic, and even though I struggled with it at the beginning, there are many masterful aspects in this book, and it has been a joy to find them all.
