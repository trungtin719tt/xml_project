If you are looking for a feel-good chick-lit to read by your Christmas tree,Anna and the French Kissis a book for you. This novel is as chick-y a lit as it gets.Anna is sent to Paris to spend her senior year at a boarding school. Of course she doesn't want to go - her life, her best friend, her potential boyfriend, her little brother and mom are in Atlanta. But Anna doesn't sulk for long, she quickly meets new friends and this one totally hot and totally unavailable boy Etienne St. Clair. Oh my, what will happen next?;o)Anna and the French Kissdoesn't break any new ground, doesn't provide insight into anything of importance, it doesn't strive to be realistic or profound, it doesn't even attempt to portray France in any non-cliche way! I can find a hundred flaws with it. But I don't want to. This novel is light, clean, funny (I especially enjoyed Anna's father, who I imagine to be just likeNicholas Sparkswith his books where someone always dies in the end), cute and sweet, with likable characters and a measured amount of teen angst. It is a quick and engaging read and a perfect holiday story.Anna and the French Kisswill never make it to my shelf of favorites, but I will probably readStephanie Perkins's next novel if it comes out around the same time next year and is equally cute and inoffensive.P.S. Why, in every YA romance, the two love interests always end up sleeping together in the same bed, but of course in a chaste way?P.P.S. Etienne is an uber-sexy name, is it not?
