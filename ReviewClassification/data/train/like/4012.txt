I decided to read this classic Agatha Christie story in anticipation of the new movie starring Kenneth Branagh as Hercule Poirot. I listened to the audiobook, performed by Dan Stevens, and it was a delight.A quick summary: The international detective Poirot is in Istanbul and is eager to get back to London. Thanks to help from a friend, he gets the last berth on the Orient Express, which was full of passengers. On the second night of the trip, a man is murdered, and tensions rise when the train gets stuck in a snowdrift. Poirot realizes the murderer must still be on the train, and sets out to interview everyone and figure out who is lying. This is a clever story, and I can see why it's one of Christie's most beloved mysteries.Dan Stevens' performance was so marvelous that after finishing I looked up what other books he has narrated and was thrilled to see he also did a reading ofAnd Then There Were None. Highly recommended!Favorite Quotes"The impossible could not have happened, therefore the impossible must be possible in spite of appearances.""If you confront anyone who has lied with the truth, he will usually admit it - often out of sheer surprise. It is only necessary to guess right to produce your effect.""I like to see an angry Englishman," said Poirot. "They are very amusing. The more emotional they feel the less command they have of language."
