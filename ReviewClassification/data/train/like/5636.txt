What can i say? Classics never die! It's time to be a kid again.The first time i read this book i was 8 years old, it was a birthday present from my parents, i was so happy because i loved Sesame Street, Who doesn't love S.S when they are kids right?The most amazing thing about this book is that Grover is trying to stop us from reaching the end of the book, where he knows there is a monster and when we are kids we love to be scared because deep down, we know we are in no real danger.So we turn page after page even when Grover beg us to stop, page after page until we reach the end.And then it turns out that the monster at the end of the book is Grover himself.It was very funny when i was 8 years old.Last week digging through my old stuff, I found my old copy of this book so naturally I started to read it , it was all fun and games until it wasn't, because now that I'm older I think really understand the meaning of this book...Often we live our lives afraid of the monster under the bed without knowing that the monster is us.We are only afraid of ourselves.
