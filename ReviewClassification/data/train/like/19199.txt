A colorful novel, even vivid, taking you into a real life deep breathing San Francisco both during the 1906 earthquake, then later in 1923 when the President of the United States, the gormless Warren G. Harding, came to town to die. It's chock full of wild and wonderful characters on both sides of the law, all worthy of attention, but its leads are forever memorable. Li, the Chinese kid who grew up to be a kingpin of the Chinese Tongs. Kit Dowie, a wild eyed rascal who dreamed of writing like Damon Runyon. And Lizzie, a spoiled brat from the top of Nob Hill, who grows up right in front of your face... at terrible cost. The writing is fast and sharp and biting and witty. This was a hell of a read.
