I can't begin to express just how much of a favorite this was in my childhood!My mom would do her best Grover voice and would mock struggle with each page turn (just as it should be read) and my sister and I would giggle and laugh so much, throwing in our muscle to try and help with turning the pages.Struggling to turn a page, you say? Well, I guess you'll just have to read it.Ages: 3 -7**Like my reviews? I also have hundreds of detailed reports that I offer too. These reports give a complete break-down of everything in the book, so you'll know just how clean it is or isn't. I also have Clean Guides (downloadable PDFs) which enable you to clean up your book before reading it!Visit my website!
