The plot unfolds in one day and is given through testimonies of people who have some kind of connection with the death of Santiago.However one-dimensional the characters may be,they don't manage to evolve at all in the time frame which this novella gives them,and although the plot is not particularly imaginative, I loved every bit of this book. The atmosphere was absolutely to my taste whilst Marquez's writing style moved me, once again.
