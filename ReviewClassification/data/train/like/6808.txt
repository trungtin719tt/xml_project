This is my fav nick sparks book ever! Which is saying something because his other book,A Walk to Rememberis heartwrenchingly beautiful and made me bawl like a baby!One of the main reasons why I adore this book is the writing, I love how the characters interact with each other and everyone has their sassy pants on. I had fun reading this book :DI've been fangirling during the cute moments between Ronnie and Will. They banter and kid around with each other a lot, but you could also sense the connection and chemistry between the two of them.Their relationship feels real, it relies on mutual respect and trust which I really like because it doesn't promote any elements of the infamous insta-love theme *shudders*. They were frenemies at first but of course the love between them develops into something much deeper...This book has multiple POVs, each person has their own voice/writing style, my favorites are of course, Ronnie and Will's. I've read a couple of books where everyone sounds the same, thankfully this wasn't the case. What makes this book different is that we also get POV from the antagonists, which brings a different angle, and also better understanding of events that happened in the book. Although I kinda feel guilty for skipping some of the parts from Ronnie's dad cause it's boring (sorry). Beware though, this book made me cry like a whole lot due to unexpected feels. So make sure there are tissues near you, just in case.P.S Nick Sparks wrote this book especially for Miley. She's awesome :)Update 2/2/17I wrote this review back in 2013 but I just wanna addthishere because I'm a big fan of Miley (seriously her song,Adore Youremains my favorite of hers) and I was struck with a wave of nostalgia when I saw it on Instagram because it's just like that moment in the car when they sang together, but only now it's Miley and Liam &lt;3
