This Unicorn, along with Ende'sNeverending Storyand Zindell'sRequiem for Homo Sapiens, has made me what I am.It has been there for me to shine and shiver with its seashell light even in the deepest night. It has been there to remind me that great heroes need great sorrows and burdens, otherwise half their greatness goes unnoticed.

For real magic, you would need a Unicorn.(Peter ...howdid you make her?)
