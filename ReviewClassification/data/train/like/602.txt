"I love reading", says a 15-year-old girl in class today.This is so unusual that I smile like a maniac."Really? I am so glad to hear that. What are you reading at the moment?""Jane Eyre, and it is very hard to understand, but I am 100 pages into it now, and I think it is great!""Jane Eyre? Jane Eyre?"I feel like a young woman who thought she was dedicated to an old, grumpy, blind man and realises there is a vital, young Mr Rochester waiting to be adored again and again underneath the surface.Can this be true? Is a classic a classic a classic? Can an idealist school librarian go home and keep the faith in Reader Heaven for once?Yes!As long as young readers find the time and the space and the leisure and the pleasure of reading about the trials of Jane Eyre, there is a place for us faithful guardians of bookish love.When I came home, I found my own copy of Jane Eyre on my daughter's bed. She finds it hard, but good."When you make it through the first 100 pages, you will love it", I say confidently. "A student of mine told me so!""And since when do you listen to your students, mum?""Since they make perfect sense!"
