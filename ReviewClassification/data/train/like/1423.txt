While I personally love a book about a child prodigy (especially in the area of telekinesis), I had a different reaction to this book while rereading it as an adult. As a kid I thought Matilda was awesome, she was intelligent and independent. As an adult I see this as a book about gross neglect and a commentary on absentee parenting and its role in our children's education.I come from a county where the dropout rate is high and everyone wants to blame the teachers, but no one identifies the real problem of parents or caregivers not taking an active role in their child's schooling. To many of them, school is free babysitting and nothing more. They take no interest in helping their children succeed and tell the educators that it is their job to teach the children, disavowing any responsibility of their own. Once in a while you have a special case like Matilda who decides to work on her education on her own, despite the indifference of her parents. But more often these children turn into cases for Child Protective Services (or the equivalent) due to the negligence occurring in their home lives.Matilda gets her happy ending, but most children in similar situations do not. Reread this as an adult with the above perspective and you will find a chilling tale of a child trying to create something better for herself than the toxic circumstances she was born into.
