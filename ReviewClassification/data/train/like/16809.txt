Ben Peller sure uses a different type of brush stroke in this final(?) installment of the To Live series. Shawn Michals has morphed into another new character, one with a past he's been running from. Enter Bina, an AMAZING strong female character who leads him to lead a revolution. There's a lot in this novel that doesn't seem related to the previous "To Live" books. Who cares! This novel is a great one. And given what's going on around the world, it is very relevant indeed.
