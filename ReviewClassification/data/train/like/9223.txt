This is a story of a young lady,MACY QUEEN, who is struggling to find herself for almost one year and a half now,after her father's sudden death,which she hasn't really grieved yet,and somehow blamed herself for that's why she never talk to anyone about her real emotions..not even to her mother or her sister.To hide her emotions,she tried to be a perfect person for her mother (who never talk much and lacks affection because like her,her mother also shields her grief by keeping herself busy) and for her perfect boyfriend named Jason (who only thinks of himself) who went to Brain Camp for summer,leaving his job on her at the library. But then,she never felt happy working in this place until she met the "Wish Catering" team,and met Wes (my favorite character here).One thing I loved about this book,is the way how Macy and Wes developed their friendship,and the way their relationship built up,starting with the "Truth" game that they played whenever they got the chance.What I didn't like was..some of the chapters were slow and confusing because there were moments when the story's describing one feature of Macy's life,and suddenly,it will plunge into another aspect or scene. And I felt like the ending had been rushed up a bit.The reason why I'm giving this book a four star ratings instead of three,is because I loved the WISH Catering characters! I enjoyed them because they were well developed,and they have portrayed their roles effectively.Over all,this one's a good book and I'm highly recommending it to young adults as it came out as a neat,wholesome romance.Thanks to my dear friend,BOOTS for recommending this to me!^^
