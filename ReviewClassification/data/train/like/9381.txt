Goodreads says I rated this 3 stars. I don't remember that, and I can't see me rating this 3.I read it years ago. I remember waiting for the hard copy to arrive in the post (this was before kindle) and being glued to the pages. This was Ash's book! The book EVERYONE wanted to read. Of course it gets 5 stars!Silly Goodreads.
