Wow, this book was dark. I've seen the movies and from those conjured up a story that had this dreamy quality of submerged attraction and envy--plus elegant old houses. But Brideshead Revisited the novel took me to a very dark and disturbing place. To me, the pieces that shone were the broken fragments of relationships: Charles and his horrible father, and the oppressive mother and Sebastian. Waugh deftly shows these strange, decaying bonds in a way that sticks with you, haunts you. I've always appreciated him as a writer; his dialogue is so facile it seems contemporary, his descriptions surprising, his characters unique and layered.The fall into adultery while aboard transcontinental ship in the midst of a storm was masterful piece of writing. The protagonist's emotional descent became an almost a physical sensation of disorientation. I felt literally sea sick afterwards.I'm not really sure how to sum up what to share about this book. I'm not sure I liked it--it certainly didn't make me feel happy after I read it. But I did appreciate that it pulled me in and took me to another place.I feel sad now.
