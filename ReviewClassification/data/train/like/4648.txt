I'm in sixth grade and we read this book in class. A ship comes and takes villagers from the village of Ghalas-at East. But a young girl named Karana gets left behind. Karana waits for the ship to come back. While she does she goes after animals, builds shelter, gets food, whatever she has to do to survive.The central idea of this story is it takes hard work to survive on an island. Karana goes out everyday at dawn and returns at sunset. That is a very long time to be out and working. She has to catch abalones, spear fish everyday to eat. There is a ravine where she has to walk to to catch water to drink. She makes her own clothes and jewelry and she builds shelter,and weapons are also made by her.Karana makes all these things by being resourceful.Scott O' Dell created a book that was very fun and interesting to read, it was hard to put down the book.Scott O' Dell was very descriptive throughout this book and used lots of details. This book wasn't to hard to read, it didn't have much dialogue and some of the vocabulary was a little tough. But overall it was an excellent reading level and fun to read.I would recommend this book to someone who loves a great adventure.
