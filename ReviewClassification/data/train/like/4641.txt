This book was freaking awesome. I loved it when I was a kid. All of the people on an island are leaving together one day, on a boat. I don't remember why. Anyhow, the main character's little brother got left behind on the shore. (What, they didn't think to do a head count before launching the boat?) She jumps off and swims back to be with him. The boat apparently drives only forward, and not in reverse, or they are in a really big hurry. I know this because they don't come back and get her or her brother.They live on the island alone. Then, her brother gets eaten by wolves. (I remember thinking at this point, darn it! I bet she wishes she hadn't stayed now. If he was just going to get eaten by wolves either way, she might as well have stayed on the boat and be eating fresh sea bass right now.)Finally, she leaves the island. I recall it being many years later. She put a bunch of paint on her face and got dressed all pretty, because she was old enough to date by then, and thought there might be a cute guy on the rescue boat or something.If I recall, her people had disappeared and no one knew what had happened to them. Hey, maybe it wasn't such a bad thing that she missed the boat, after all!This book was awesome. I read it several times. I can't believe how many books I read and re-read and re-re-read. I could have finished the encyclopedia by now if I'd only focused on reading new things as a kid. (By the way, I LOVED reading the encyclopedia when I was a kid. It rocks.)
