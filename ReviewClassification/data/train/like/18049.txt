Gunter Grass is the only winner of the Nobel Prize able to speak Kaszub a weird Slavic language still spoken in the area of Danzig. Perhaps realizing that he spoke a language that belonged to the world of myth and magic but not to his own century, Grass decided to convert his experiences into a twentieth century fairy tale.The hero Little Oskar is a boy born in the Free City of Danzig, a state that was created by the 1919 Treaty of Paris and liquidated by the Germans in September 1939. Little Oskar grows up in a German household with relatives in both the Kaszub and Polish camps. The Germans are shown as crass, vulgar and materialistic boobs while the Poles are portrayed as dim-witted yocals. The two groups live in reasonably good harmony both possessing a love of alcohol, smoked-eels and illicit sex.The German invasion drives the Poles out of the city. In turn the Russians arrive and expel the Germans all of which Grass presents in relatively jolly terms. The rape of his Little Oskar's grandmother by a group of Russian soldiers is described with levity and the extermination of 1,000,000 OstDeutsch that occurred in 1945 is never even mentioned in the novel. Grass prefers to give his reader the sunny version of history.His hero little Oskar however is traumatized. First he stops growing and remains dwarf sized into adult life. Once in Germany, he resumes his growth but cannot adjust to the new Federal Republic. He is confined to an asylum where he writes his memoirs for us to read.While the tale might seem weird it succeeds brilliantly in Grass's rendering. There is a constant flow of crude German humour and middle European bonhommie. Grass is above all good natured. The Poles claimed him as one of their own and their hearts were gladdened whenever he spoke Polish in public for which they cannot be blamed. Grass is a wonderful writer, richly deserving of his nobel prize. Read it when you want some light-hearted fun.
