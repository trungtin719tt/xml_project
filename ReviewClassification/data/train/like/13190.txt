I haven't reviewed this yet? It's definitely time, now that the series is over!I loved this book even more than the first. It's such a delicious read! The teens you've come to know and really like are on the run from the Edison Group, and they have to get to know each other and trust each other over the course of their escape.I think my favorite bit of the book was the whole part with Derek and Chloe alone. I don't know if I want them to end up together or not, but I really enjoyed the adventures the two had, and it was good to learn more about Derek. He's actually a really cool guy, and it was great to see him finally stop being so rude, open up, and learn to trust someone other than Simon. I always love good character development, and this really delivered. Aside from Derek's experience, we finally get to see Tori change from her nasty mean girl act, Simon become even more endearing, and Chloe learn more about her powers and herself. If that wasn't enough to make me keep reading, all the chilling parts where Chloe raised spirits from the dead were amazingly well-written! This is one of the few series I've read that has actually been able to scare me (but in a good way). Read it!
