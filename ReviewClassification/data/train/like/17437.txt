This is a book that reminds me why you should NEVER trust goodreads ratings. By looking at the rating I really had low expectations about this book and guess what? I loved it!For starters, this book wasn't like other sci-fi dystopians that are always so similar: Special girl who ends up being the key to everything, and forced romance. Nope this one was more sci-fi than dystopia.Another thing I liked was the romance. It was just right amount, not too much to make the reading tacky and enough to keep me wondering and turning the pages at top speed.Worldbuilding was great, which is something that is not always common in YA dystopia. And the twist at the end, was a great addition to an already well constructed plot! It left me wanting more.I don't think this book is perfect by any means and I won't add it to my favorites, but as far as YA dystopia it deserves more love.
