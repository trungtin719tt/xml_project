As science-fiction, or as a dystopian space mystery this book was pretty much awesome. I loved the idea behind it: frozen people being transported on a spaceship to a new planet, destined to arrive in 300 years from take-off... but, uh-oh, not everything goes to plan. Someone is reviving the frozen people in their containers with the intention of letting them drown.I really liked this whole aspect of it, and I've never been a space story fan. I never cared for Star Wars, Star Trek... or anything like that. My problem was how the book was sold to the audience. It should have been shown like this:But instead it was marketed as a romance story, which it just wasn't. A few lustful imaginings of a teenage boy is hardly a romance novel, the publishers obviously thought that was all young adult readers want. But, let's face it, very few guys are going to be interested in reading this book just by looking at the cover (yeah, I know, guys are silly and what's not to love about pink sparkles?). This is much more sci-fi or mystery than it is romance. In fact, there is hardly any romantic suggestion at all - and most of what there is happens to be one-sided. Does Amy even like Elder that way? She seemed to do an awful lot of pining for her ex-boyfriend, Jason, rather that showing much interest in Elder.Not that I mind that much, the story wasn't lacking without the sweet-nothings and teen love (perhaps a refreshing change actually), plus I loved the sci-fi. Will definitely read the next book.
