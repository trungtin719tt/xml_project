Peller outdoes himself in this book, the final of his "To Live" trilogy. Shawn Michals is now on a remote island, and there's political chaos in the air, and inner turmoil within himself. Enter Bina, a seductress of the first order. (This is going to be one of my longer reviews, because this book really touched me). And yes, there are spoilers...Shawn is coerced by Bina into running for President of the Island, representing a group of people known as "The Acceptance." Shawn is seduced by this woman and the thought of making social change in an island ravaged by political and religious infighting (sound familiar citizens of the world?) In the end he is captured by the ruling party tortured, threatened with death, and forced to head to make a speech after which a certain doom is promised. But The Acceptance rescues him, and the Island is granted with new leadership. A new era of growth. Fantasy? Let's hope not. With the way our world is going, we could use a fantasy such as this book and its fantasyLAnd promises.
