This story perfectly captures the logic, mindset, and rational of children. I loved seeing the way these kids viewed the world, and I loved their rational when their worldview was proven wrong. The strongest ellement of this book is the way Mark Twain was able to get into the minds of children and depiction it so perfectly on the page.The thing I didn't love as much was the meandering plot. There was clearly a direction and purpose to this story, but it took forever to get there and there were a lot of stops along the way where we just hung out with the characters. As a plot driven reader, that left me imaptient board at times. Still a great story though
