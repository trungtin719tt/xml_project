I really enjoyed the story, so many heartwarming moments, especially those involving Pug and the Duke.Most characters were interesting and nicely introduced, although maybe they were alla little too good. There are no evil guys (not for long, that is, to this point at least) and I wished otherwise, I love to hate some villains, lol.It was, overall, a lovely start and I'm happy I had the chance to start this journey. Will definitely read the following books in the near future. Thanks again David! x
