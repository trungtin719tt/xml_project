ok, like I just wrote in a comment . . . this is probably one of those books that you have to read at a particular moment in your life.for me I was 15, had just run away from home and was in utter despair that the entire world was as mean, strict and narrow-minded as my peers seemed to be at that time. I longed for a friend, I longed for a sense of the world being more than what was drowning me.the friend who put this book in my hands also gave me Blind Melon's first album - and together these two items may have literally saved my life.Bach's writing is simplistic, yes. it is almost childlike, yes. But there is for me an enduring wisdom to it. the seagull is obviously a very simplistic metaphor for a human, but in reality, particularly from where I was at the time, the idea of the "flock" just doing as it was told and spending all its time eating, shitting and talking about other gulls was not far off from my experience.as that 15 year old gypsy soul, I connected - not the gull - but with the sense that there had to be more to life and that the pursuit of perfection was not in vain. this book was like a child's story that assured me that my sense of things was not off-base. and I'm not kidding when I say that I felt that Jonathan Livingston Seagull was my first friend.
