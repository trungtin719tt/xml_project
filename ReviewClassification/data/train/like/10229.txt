I did a wonderful year-long read aloud with my kindergarten class last year, and it was a fantastic experience. They asked so many good questions, and it spawned so much good discussion, exciting writing and enthusiasm about the books. Kids talked, wrote and drew pictures about different episodes all year. I highly recommend it. I would have loved to integrate this with more study of one-room schoolhouses and our city so many years ago (maybe for 2nd grade?). Part of the reason this worked well for my kindergarten kids--in spite of their limited experience with Wisconsin and woods and wagons and farms--is that they, too, were only 5 or 6 years old. In imagining a little girl their own age facing such challenges and fears, and having such fun adventures, was a wonderful experience for them. Since I am a reader and reading specialist more than a kindergarten teacher, I used this book to begin a lot of wonderful deeper comprehension work. By the end of the book (and a year with other wonderful read-alouds), they were using vocabulary like "connection" and "prediction" when talking about what they thought about stories. It was invigorating and inspirational.
