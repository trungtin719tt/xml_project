A beautiful and heart touching story of Heidi and her early life on the Alm.Her Aunt leaves her with Alm-Uncle her Grandfather in a small hut of little means. She is so attached to the Alp life that when she is taken away by her Aunt to Frankfort, even her best efforts to be with Klara does not stop her from longing for her life back home.Eventually she makes it back and is visited by the Doctor, with his own life difficulties, is healed by the Alps and Heidi's care.Finally Klara comes and finds the same healing powers from the beautiful country and loving care given to her by Grandfather. He has changed himself from the visitors, a much softer side. When Klara starts to walk everyone is happy, except Peter, who all along has been jealous of all the visitors and their time with Heidi. He has done something horrible as revenge for taking up Heidi's time away from him.In the end the Alm has reached the souls of all who partake in the healing gift the Alps has to offer. Life has been very healing for everyone with Heidi being the main reason, with her loving and caring ways.It would seem that writing stories helped Spyri to find her personal road out of the traditional, all too devotional way of accepting suffering as an unchangeable fate - a way that had been paved by her family.When Spyri was asked to write her autobiography, she refused with the words: "The external path of my life is quite simple, and there is nothing special to be mentioned. My inner life was full of storms, but who can describe it?"
