I'm not going to lie; I read this book (and, before it, 'The Unbearable Lightness of Being') because they were the books referenced in the movie version of 'High Fidelity' that Rob used to point out that he wasn't dumb, because he understood them (they're about girls, right?).And now that I too can claim to be smart, because I've read these books, I can say that he's pretty much right. They are about girls, when you get right down to it. Yes, of course, there is an embarrassingly great deal of other things the books are about, but the heart of it is love and girls, and loving girls. Lots of them.This book is very dense and very beautifully written. In the hands of a lesser writer, this book could have been embarrassing and tawdry. However, Garcia Marquez is a master of prose and is able to craft a story in which the protagonist beds 622 different women over the course of his life and make it seem like something so much more than simply sex. Like 'Unbearable Lightness...', it depicts sex as a necessary function in life, but also a precious, beautiful thing.I loved this book, and that's entirely attributable to Garcia Marquez's mastery. I'll admit, it wasn't an easy read, and took me a great deal longer than I'd anticipated, but it was worth it. Like Rob Gordon, I feel like a better person for having read it.
