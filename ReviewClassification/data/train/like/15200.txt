I actually wasn't going to write a review for this book but I simply cannot leave my thoughts for it uncovered. I cried three times while reading the book and that is a rarity. Big time. The story was so believable and the characters were just as believable and inspiring. Also, Sarah Dessen has a way of words that leaves you speechless. No one could 'philosophize' about life and love and family the way she does. I immediately realized how modest and incredible she is as an author and I hope to read many many many more books by her in the future. If you are looking for contemporary books that are equally as gripping as Thrillers but in a different way, then Sarah Dessen is your author and I would highly recommend you to pick this one up!
