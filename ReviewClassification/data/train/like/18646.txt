Darkness at Noonis a dramatised version of real events, an obvious but unnamed simulacrum of Stalinist Russia, with Rubashov, formerly a senior member of the Party, suddenly arrested and imprisoned for invented crimes. Driven not by character or plot but by ideas, it depicts Rubashov's state of mind and thought process as his incarceration forces him to contemplate the part he has played in building a dictatorship, and his disillusionment with the political philosophy he has imposed on others. It's perhaps a weird thing to say about a book with such sombre themes, but it felt like such a relief to read something like this - it's such a powerful and intelligent novel, and it reminded me why 'classics' are worth reading.(Possibly to be continued/expanded later)
