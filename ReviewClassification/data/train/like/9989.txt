Little House on the Prairie is the second novel in the series, the first beingLittle House in the Big Woods. But they are stand alone stories so they don't have to be read together. Written byLaura Ingalls Wilder, the Little House books are semi-autobiographical and are told from young Laura's point of view. Yes, they are children's books, and they are written in a very simplistic style, maybe overly so for the adult reader, but perfectly suited for children. I don't think there is any doubt that the popular television series has really helped the book's perception. It has it's faults, like the insensitive treatment of the American Indian, for example. But it's earned it's spot in the annals of classic children's literature. For me, similar, but not quite on the same level withLittle WomenandAnne of Green Gables.
