What do you do when all hope is lost?For the people in this book about our world dying of radiation after an atomic war the answer seems to be carry on as normally as possible. Go to the beach, swim, sail, go to work, enjoy parties and drink, plant the daffodils, clear the trees and chop the wood .There is no let up for the reader, always the knowledge that it will happen.It's a bleak vision of a post apocalyptic world that is at once both terrifying and moving.As I said in my earlier update it felt like a black and white film from the fifties, the manners, the correctness, the language of the book is of that time.There is no humour, no let up as it slowly arrives at the inevitable conclusion.41/2* but rounded up to 5 . Nevil Shute once again held me captive with this haunting story.
