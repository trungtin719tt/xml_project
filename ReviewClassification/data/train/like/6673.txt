I never knew that a graphic novel could be so moving, so haunting and so phenomenally powerful.The complete Maus tells the tale of Hitler's Europe and the experiences of one Jewish man, the author/illustrator Art Spiegelman's father Vladek. It is a book that doesn't hold any punches and is jaw dropping in its exploration of humanity through both the atrocities and ethnic cleansing of that time and of how this moulds a man forever.I don't have the words to fully express all I'm feeling right now so please read these two reviews byAMANDAandFABIANto fully grasp what this graphic novel is about.I don't read graphic novels. I haven't read a comic since I was a little kid reading the Beano. So maybe you might think this isn't for you...You'd be wrong.Everyone should read this.Highly recommendedfour and a half stars
