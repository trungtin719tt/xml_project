ACrazyTrainAll Aboard!No novel will ever approach THE TRIAL in its intensely nightmarish portrayal of the type of dark "justice" of the dictatorial governments that came to powerafterits 1925 publication, or, conversely, giving one a special, and by all means necessary, appreciation for the criminal justice system and fundamental rights granted those in democracies.Imagine: you are charged with a crime, but no one will tell you what that crime is, who specifically (what part of government) is charging you with the crime and/or is tasked with prosecuting the charges against you, where to read the law that prohibits the forbidden act, omission or conspiracy, when you committed the "crime," who accused you, the substance of the evidence against you (even in general terms), who or what was harmed, when your trial will take place, who will be charged with finding you guilty or innocent, what type of punishment you may face, whether you may appeal, among other missing items. Then, when you talk to court workers and even your own lawyer, there may be some nebulous way to avoid prosecution but no one can say exactly what that is and otherwise it's a foregone conclusion that you will be found guilty, your best hope being to drag out the process as long as you can just tostay aliveas thiscrazy trainhurtles toward your inevitable end.A historic classic masterwork that plants in its reader bad-dream seeds that may not germinate for years, but they will... yes, they will.
