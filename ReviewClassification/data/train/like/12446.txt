Rehvenge's Story brings back the hard-hitting action and suspense we've come to expect from this series!Beware of Spoilers if you haven't read the first 6 books in the series......every once in a while, from out of the blue, someone reaches the quiet place where you spend your private time and changes the way you see yourself...I'm cautiously optimistic... I feel like we've reached a turning point with this installment, and I sincerely hope the momentum continues with the subsequent books.As usual, the stories surrounding all of the secondary and tertiary characters stole the show:- Beth and Wrath feature prominently in this book.- John Matthew has a giant role.- Doc Jane has several cameos.- There's a shift in the Brotherhood.- Lassiter the Angel has some awesome dialogue.- The Scribe Virgin is moping around like an empty-nester.- Lash plays a great big part in this book, which I think will appease the readers who have been less than thrilled with the amount of pages taken up by theLessers...But the Stars of this book were Rehvenge and Ehlena:REHVENGEHis glowing amethyst eyes saw everyone and cared about no one.Rehv - or the Reverend, as the human clientele called him - was a drug lord and a pimp who didn't give a shit about the vast majority of people. Which meant he was capable of, and frequently did, anything the fuck he wanted to.Rehv is the infamous Zero-Sum club owner who has a larger than life personality which is only enhanced by his Sympath heritage... Talk about a hard-ass with a heart of gold...EHLENA"Must the world always be so harsh, I wonder,"Ehlena is a nurse in Haver's clinic - and what do you want to bet she was the nurse who helped Phury evacuate the patients inLover Enshrined? I bet she was... Anyway, Ehlena is your quintessential care-giver who believes that every soul is worth saving... Plus, she winds up being a smart female with a spine of steel. I mean, the woman goes toe to toe with Xhex! :OUnfortunately, the Romance portion of the plot between these two was firmly in the whole"I love her but I don't deserve her"vs."He's dreamy but he'll never love little 'ol me"trope, which I loathe... Complete with some"I'll push her away so I don't break her heart"behavior. Not cool, J.R. Ward... Not cool..As you may know, I've been a bit peeved by the constant references to brands - most of the time the detail is completely irrelevant to the point of distraction... So as I read Lover Avenged, I resolved to write down every single brand name mentioned.The result was staggering! You can see the result here:http://smutsonian.com/2014/07/03/j-r-...Now for the more spoiler-y thoughts:(Read at your own risk)(view spoiler)[Wrath is now completely blind. I have to admit, it hurt my heart to know he wouldn't be able to fight with this Brothers any more... I don't think anybody wanted to see him lay down his daggers for good.Also, you know I'm a dog lover... So I was stoked to meet Wrath's Seeing Eye Dog, George... but that's not nearly a bad-ass enough name. I think he should beGhorge... You know how much the Brotherhood likes to throw an extra H into a name ;)The scenes from inside the Sympath Colony were amazing... J.R. Ward really tapped into a cinematic quality with the visuals on that one. The cell which held Rehv, as well as the apparatus he was attached to... Not to mention the darkness and creepy-crawlies...John Matthew has long been my favorite character of this series, but he needs to get his shit together. His little emotional roller-coaster throughout this book was exhausting... He's had to go through so much shit in his life before his transition, and he seemed to be in such a good place... Then he found Tohr, had sex with the Symath of his dreams... And he just checked out, got drunk, and started driving me nuts.I know J.R. Ward is a fan of making characters hit rock-bottom before she gives them their own book, but seriously... Get it together John!(hide spoiler)]My Other Reviews in the Black Dagger Brotherhood Series:1.Dark Lover-My Review2.Lover Eternal-My Review3.Lover Awakened-My Review4.Lover Revealed-My Review5.Lover Unbound-My Review6.Lover Enshrined-My Review6.5Father Mine-My Review7.Lover Avenged- You're Reading It8.Lover Mine-My Review9.Lover Unleashed-My Review10.Lover Reborn-My Review11.Lover At Last-My Review12.The King-My Review13.The Shadows-My Review
