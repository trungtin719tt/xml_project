This is my first time reading H.P. Lovecraft. I've always heard his name mentioned, particularly in reference to "The Call of Cthulhu," which is mentioned quite frequently in pop culture. I've seen Cthulhu stuffed animals, Cthulhu T-Shirts, and even World of Warcraft references H.P Lovecraft lore with their Ancient Ones. Anyway, I finally read his works, and I do have some mixed feelings about his writing style, but overall, I really liked this book.Tales of H.P. Lovecraftis a general collection of his better known short stories. I'll break it down story by story, to give a good idea of my impressions.This Introduction itself by Joyce Carol Oates is highly interesting. I do suggest reading the Introduction first as it gives some very good background information on H.P. Lovecraft's life and writing style. I don't think it's the best sort of biography you can find if you're interested in that. I'm actually curious and wouldn't mind searching around to see if such a biography exists, but this introduction does give a general idea of his backstory, which adds depth to my enjoyment of his stories.The first story is "The Outsider." The story itself is very cryptic in nature, meaning I found it perplexing in what exactly was going on and who this narrator was. This made reading the story very fun, and I'd say it has a fantasy and horror element to it. The ending is highly predictable, but nevertheless enjoyable, and so it makes sense why this story is placed first in the collection.The second story is "The Music of Erich Zann." I actually preferred this story a lot more than "The Outsider." Basically, it's about a young man who was living on a small street in Paris called the Rue d'Auseil. Unusually, however, since moving, he was never able to rediscover it, despite much searching, and it doesn't appear to be found on any map. This is just one of the many aspects of Lovecraft's stories, where inconceivable instances such as this happen quite frequently. But what's intriguing about this book is the curtain found in the old man's room upstairs. There is so much suspense involved with the viol player and what is occurring outside the window. And then it is revealed, and it completely dumbfounded me. It was not what I expected. Overall, a wonderful story, although since loving the story so much I read it a second time, and I found the second reading to be a tad bit less enjoyable, but it is still good nonetheless."The Rats in the Wall" is next. Honestly I find this story to be a tad more forgettable than most of them. It does have a whole slew of characters, as the narrator introduces almost every member of his crazy family as he does research into his family's ancient dark past. Strangely, we get a taste of H.P. Lovecraft's slightly racist side, as the narrator's cat is actually named Nigger-Man. Yes! Can you believe that? The ending is quite fantastical though, and probably the best part of the story. It reminds me of the episode of Angel when he goes into the other dimension with the spider like creatures that worship Jasmine. Lovecraft really has a sense of the visual in this story that excites the imagination.The next is "The Shunned House." This one too is very much like "Rats in the Wall." The narrator goes into the history of this strange abandoned house, where all the vegetation is dead and freaky looking, like strange purple fungus, etc. So, the narrator goes through the town annuls, and he researches about the family who once lived there. So here we get a real sense of the strange history of what happened. I actually found that part the most intriguing, because it felt like I was unraveling a mystery while reading his story. However, the culmination of what happens with the narrator and his uncle is quite anti-climactic. It seems like it would be this huge exciting thing, but the "monster" disappears like a puff of smoke, which was slightly disappointing. Overall, it is a good story, but I wish the ending could have been a tad bit more exciting.The next story is "The Call of Cthulhu," which is actually my least favorite of all the stories. This one goes on and on in complete tedium. Basically the narrator ties together all these stories, which are supposed to connect through his grand-uncle, but to me they seem so jumbled and unrelated. Apparently, his grand-uncle was walking to his house, when a "nautical-looking negro" (basically a black sailor) comes by and pushes his grand-uncle down a hill and killing him. This whole event is completely ridiculous, and I feel like H.P. Lovecraft just throws it in to show his dislike towards black people. Either that or he really wanted to write the words "nauticaul-looking negro."The rest of this story isn't too bad. I mean sure it's tedious, but where it gets really bad is the part with the mystery derelict found at sea. I don't see the point of this portion of the story at all, and I recommend skipping it if you appreciate any bit of your time. The ending is quite interesting, however, and I love how H.P. Lovecraft describes the Ancient Ones' island. Although, I swear, Lovecraft has an obsession with the word Cyclopean. Sure, it's a good word, but he uses it constantly, that I can't help but wish he used something else.Next is "The Colour Out of Space." This story stands out as it is so different from the previous stories. It takes place in a super small town, and here we get a really good sense of local color. I love it for that, and this is why it's one of my most favorite of his stories, at least of the stories found in this book. It reminds me of that story shown in Creepshow with the meteor that falls on the farm, and eventually turning the man into some sort of moss creature; however, this story is ten times better. I highly recommend it."The Dunwich Horror" follows that one, and this is probably one of his better known stories. There is a board game based on it, and Yog-Sothoth, if you've ever played World of Warcraft you'd know of the boss Yogg Saron that most definitely references it. Haha! Love you Blizzard! Anyway, this story is definitely worth reading if you want to read H.P. Lovecraft. The entire story is good all round, but the final few pages are such a letdown. I was hoping for some epic battle, but it seems that H.P. Lovecraft is good on the suspense but bad on the epicness.Next is "At the Mountains of Madness." While researching H.P. Lovecraft, I've found that this story always comes up for some reason, although I've never heard of it prior to this. On it's own it's a pretty decent story, although it's way too long for what it is. I wish Lovecraft could have kept it shorter, but you take what you can get. The story takes place in Antarctica where a group of scientists discover a giant mountain with a hidden cavern underneath, where they find these strange plant-like alien creatures. One of the scientists, a biologist, dissects one of the plants, but something goes awry. A huge blizzard sweeps across the camp destroying everything, and so a rescue team comes and guess what they find...wait for it...the biologist is found on the operating table completely cut open and dissected. And of course, these scientists, are like what the f*** happened? But guess what happens next! They forget about the whole thing and decide it would be in their best interest to go exploring these mountains. Okay, maybe the mountains turned them mad, hence the name, but who else thinks that's strangely weird? I mean if I found a body dissected on a table, I would think, personally, that there was some crazy psycho on the loose and it's time to leave. But no, they go exploring until they stumble upon the monster who of course ends up chasing them. I mean, what else would you expect!? This sucker is a whopping 93 pages, so it's much longer than any of the other stories. It's still worth reading, but I might skim through some of the boring parts next time.Next is "The Shadow Over Innsmouth." This one is definitely the most exciting of all of the short stories found in this book. I actually couldn't put this story down, and I read it pretty much all the way through. Seriously, it was that good. It's about a guy who comes upon this town where things are mighty weird. And they get mighty weirder as he realizes they're going to try and kill him and sacrifice him to the sea monsters. So, the narrator is constantly trying to find an escape so he isn't killed, and it's just awesome to read how he does it. This one is probably my absolute favorite of all of them. I didn't see the ending coming at all. I mean I did once the character started referring to what was happening, but the majority of the way through the book I had no idea. So 5 stars to Mr. Lovecraft for his story on Innsmouth. :)Finally, we have "The Shadow Out of Time." This one is nice, because it definitely adds to the Lovecraftian lore, but personally, if this story was not in the book, I don't think it would have been missing that much. I mean, it's good, overall, but it just leaves you with this sinking, empty feeling, which isn't a really good way to end the book. Personally, I would have liked it to end with Innsmouth, where I was blown away by what happened, and left excited by what happened. This one, I was like, oh okay, yeah, that makes sense. After all, the end of the story is given away in the first paragraph. I never really understood when authors do that. I mean, yeah I get it, it's about hooking you, and then getting you all suspensed up along the way, but then you're not really surprised by what happens, you know? Anyway, it's a good story, I get why it's last, because it refers to a lot of stories referenced before, so you get a really good idea at this point on Lovecraft's style, which really fleshes out this story; however, I would have much preferred Innsmouth to be the last one, but what can you do! :)Anyway, I do recommend reading H.P. Lovecraft, but you have to love horror sci-fi. Since I love both, it works for me, but I could see a lot of people not really getting into his stories. However, since so much pop-culture references Lovecraft, I feel that it behooves one to become familiar with his works. I mean, when you start looking and you know what to notice, things reference Lovecraft all the time, whether it's other authors or video games or trading card games. Also, Lovecraft does a really good job in creating his own Universe and Mythos, which he does so well and successfully. :)
