Overhyped, yess. But the embedded bits of brilliance are worthwhile. The play of language is what I'm most interested in here, more than the meditations on loss, holocaust, and history's shadow of brutality, personal (micro) history intersecting with, building, and being torn apart by, macro history. Those elements are there, yes.But Alex's play of language, it goes on even in the midst of disaster. Yeah, it's a metaphor for the difficulty of all cultural, and thus personal, understanding and communication. Sometimes it's too damned clever. Sometimes you wake up your neighbors laughing.And to give context--I was given this book by a woman I fell for during a particularly chaotic phase of both of our lives. She had had some considerable trouble in this culture, and was returning to the place she'd come from; thus the book. And she shares Foer's ability to look at something with total openness, to make suffering and insight and quotidian things alike fucking light up with the fire of understanding. And what we never accomplished in, physical communication, we did in letters, in messages: despite the difficulties of culture and language, it happened in words. As it does in Foer's novel.So what I love about this book has only something to do with the book, and more with the process of communication itself, with language, and how I fell in love with it once again, with eyes open, knowing the pain and the risk.
