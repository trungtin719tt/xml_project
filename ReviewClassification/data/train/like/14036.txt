After a long break from reading books like a maniac I'm back on track at devouring books like snickers. I first gave this 3 stars but then I thought to myself "I am being to harsh" and so I changed my rating to that of 4 stars, and maybe I'm being generous but I liked this a lot, so that's what I made my mind up to.Back on the amazing world of vampires, Richelle Mead created and which I'm grateful for. I'm no beginner to this world. I read VA two years ago and started Bloodlines a few months ago and after liking the first book in the series considerably a lot, I decided to continue the series, and I stand by my decision.Sydney is such a smart character and so different from Rose, the only trait I've noticed these two share, is that of being protective of their friends, and that's one hell of a trait to share. Sydney is the definition of brilliance, she's the Einstein-kind-of smart.While there's not much plot to this book other than some new leads on those mysterious vampire hunters, things get heated up once in a while. We have abductions and revelations and basically we're still at the point where Sydney is being convinced into letting herself embrace the idea of not being such a fanatic, like most of her kind.As to why I gave this book three stars because other than the cliffhanger at the end of the book, where we finally witness some changes in(view spoiler)[Sydney and Adrian's relationship(hide spoiler)], nothing else happens but still overalls the book was incredibly good and a nice follow-up to Bloodlines.Here, let me tell you how much I adore Adrian. I didn't always use to like him. He got on my nerves actually because he was not himself around Rose, he just kept wanting to change without really wanting to. With Sydney, he's a different Adrian, and they're not even together. This Adrian, the one he is next to Sydney, I love and support fully.PS: why is Sydney so damn stubborn?PSS: you'll have to read the last scene to find out what she's being stubborn about.
