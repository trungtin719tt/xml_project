Of Mice and Menis a tale about the ultimate kindness - it is hard to talk about kindness without turning sentimental butJohn Steinbeckwas the one who really could.His ear heard more than what was said to him, and his slow speech had overtones not of thought, but of understanding beyond thought.Simple men of this cruel world live in their own dreamlands and they dream of rainbows.
