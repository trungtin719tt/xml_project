This is a fantastic book that teaches everyone that reads it, regardless of their age, that it is more important to love yourself than to care what other people think of you. There will always be people judging you and telling you that you aren't good enough. But this book has a beautiful message that you were created to be unique and you are not a mistake. I love this book because it is a god reminder that I am in charge of how I will live my life. Little Punchinello is someone I think we can all relate to in the knowledge that sometimes we don't feel like we're good enough, but that just means we're measuring ourselves to the wrong standard.
