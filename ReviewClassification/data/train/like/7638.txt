Now, I happened to be at a Wal-Mart at 11:53 pm on December third, the day before this book was to be released. Upon my arrival to the inside of the store, I saw a table decorated with a single blue balloon, and a plastic tablecloth. Taped across the front of the small buffet table was a sign that said "Join us at 12:01 for Tales of Beedle the Bard!" Needless to say, I squealed aloud with delight, and my best friend blushed with embarrassment at being seen in public with a squealing Harry Potter fan. I could hardly believe that I had forgotten the realease date for the storybook Harry Potter fans everywhere were waiting for! Of course, I searched frantically for my wallet, but it was nowhere to be found, lost in the abyss that is my purse. As I began to walk away with my head hung low, Kristen, the dearest friend I've ever known, then took me by the hand and led me back to the table. She told me that she would buy me the book as an early Christmas present, but I had to promise to love it. And that very night, after I had finished the book, my promise was kept, and I loved it.
