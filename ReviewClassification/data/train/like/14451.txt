"Books are a uniquely portable magic."This book blew my mind!!! I mean, I knew I loved Stephen King and I already knew a lot of the things you learn in this book, but to read it in his own words is even better!The biographical part of the book was truly amazing, this man has come through so much, whether it's alcoholism, the drug addiction or the accident which nearly killed him. And he's so humble and honest about all of these things. And it just makes me admire him even more.As for the actual part where he discusses writing, it's so eye-opening to get a look into how he approaches his work and his stories, and where his ideas come from. I'm by no means an aspiring writer but found it fascinating to read about the do's and don'ts of writing. Some things are fairly obvious, but other things I never would have thought of!My favourite thing about this book is basically any time he mentions his wife, Tabby. It's like you can almost feel the love and admiration radiate from the pages. These two are couple goals!I thoroughly loved every single page in the book and didn't want it to end! It was one of the best King books I've ever read. His personality and sense of humour just shine right through!Absolutely brilliant.Update: listened to the audiobook in May 2018 and it was EVEN BETTER as the man himself narrates it. Highly recommend to all Constant Readers and aspiring writers.
