I don't know what I expecting when I started in on this. Something dull as tombs, a la some of the other classics I've been reading lately. Or something ostentatious, based solely on my familiarity with Graves as a poet (which makes no sense, because he's a wonderful poet). At any rate, the book totally blew my expectations out of the water. Fascinating from the word go, this is a stellar historical account of the early Roman Empire, as seen through the eyes of its misfit Emperor Claudius. For all that it isn't dialogue heavy and often veers away from the narrator's own life, its every page is riveting. Without an understanding of the individual personalities of the Emperors, it's easy to lump them all together. But Graves presents a glimpse into real and specific human beings and the reasons why they led Rome into a steep decline. This is easily one of the best books I've read this year.
