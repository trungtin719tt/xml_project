I read this book when I was a kid before or immediately after the film. It was an exciting read and I became addicted to Clancy for a brief period before I realised how propagandistic his writing became for the military-industrial complex. Like the epic thriller with Sean Connery, this book is breathtakingly fast-paced and full of fun characters and the iconic Jack Ryan as a CIA agent. My father actually hunted Russian subs back in the 70s so he could attest to the realism of the scenario to a degree but particularly to the excitement during the cold war of the battle underwater. A great summer beach read.
