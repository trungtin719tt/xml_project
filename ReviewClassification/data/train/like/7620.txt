Right before the last installment came out, I went to the public library and checked out the first book in the series, and didn't stop until I had closed the final one. It took me about two and a half months, but I read the whole series from start to finish.Say what you will about the story, the characters, the writing, but from my experience in child care over the last five years, I can assure you that it is not all too common to see a child toting a book under their arm, waiting for three minutes of "down time" so they can happily plant their nose between the pages, but it is so much more rare that if you do see one, that the book is not Harry Potter.So when people hail this series as "The story that got America's youth to start reading again," I don't protest.And I have noticed a surge. There's the Series Of Unfortunate Events, and the Spiderwick Chronicles. Kids are reading more. It makes me excited to stock my (at work) shelves with the Chronicles of Narnia and the Dark Is Rising series.And yeah, I really enjoyed reading Harry Potter, too.
