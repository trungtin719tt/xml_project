Murder on the Orient Expressis one of Agatha Christie's most loved works.Adapted for radio, film and television, most people have some idea to what you are referring when you mention it. A classic whodunit with Christie's signature styling.I adore Hercule Poirot and grew up binging Christie's works. I read this book as a child, and of course, have watched a couple of the movie adaptations.In spite of that, I still had a rollicking good time reading this again. There is something so satisfying about the ending of this one. I couldn't dream up a better conclusion.I think if you are looking to get into Christie's books, this is an excellent starting point as I feel it is a perfect example of her method!
