Lonesome Dove is my favorite book of all time and, when asked, is what I consider to be the greatest American novel ever written. It was so engrossing and the characters so compelling and the adventures so entertaining, that I wanted to read it in one sitting. It's one of those reads that I envy others who have yet to read it.Gus and Call are two of the most memorable characters in American fiction. They are the yin &amp; yang of cowboys: one caring and comical, the other cold and unemotional.Blue Duck is one of the most evil characters I can remember reading about. Lorena the whore will win your heart as she grows in self-esteem after she is taken in by Clara and shown that she is worthy of love. So many other great characters that I don't have the time in the day to write about them.Please read and enjoy!
