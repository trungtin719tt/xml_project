Goodness, I loved this book when I was a young teen, and I read it more times than I can count. I still have the ancient paperback copy of this book and its sequel,Belles on Their Toes, on my basement bookshelves. It's worth grabbing on sale if you like humorous, nostalgic memoirs.It's a (semi-)factual account of the Gilbreth family, growing up in the early 1900s. The parents were both well-known engineers and "efficiency experts" who tried, with mixed success, to apply their theories and ideas to raising a large family of twelve (YES) children.* It's a funny, fond, and heartwarming account of their growing up years, as told by two of the children.Dad himself used to tell a story about one time when Mother went off to fill a lecture engagement and left him in charge at home. When Mother returned, she asked him if everything had run smoothly. 'Didn't have any trouble except with that one over there,' he replied. 'But a spanking brought him into line.'Mother could handle any crisis without losing her composure.That's not one of ours, dear,' she said. 'He belongs next door.'This probably goes without saying, but other than being about a very large family, the Steve Martin movieCheaper by the Dozenhas pretty much zero in common with this book.*One of their daughters, Mary, died in her childhood. I vividly remember how disappointed I was as a teen when I ran the numbers mentally and realized that the family never had twelve living children at the same time. "How can the dad say his children were cheaper by the dozen? And why did they put twelve kids in the car in the cover image?"I was rather literal-minded as a girl.
