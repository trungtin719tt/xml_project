I read this book a week ago and I've been mulling over exactly what I want to say about it, but I'm still not sure what that is. Simply put, I really loved the book. It was one of those wonderful books that sucked me in and I could not put it down until it was finished with me. Part of the reason I loved it was for the way there were stories within stories within stories, like some kind of literary Russian nested doll. Seeing how the stories connect together across time and cultures is a reminder of how stories have the power to connect us to one another. Also, I loved the voice of the unnamed narrator. Intelligent, sarcastic, cynical, and, toward the end, a believable change in his perspective without succumbing to maudlin sentimentality.
