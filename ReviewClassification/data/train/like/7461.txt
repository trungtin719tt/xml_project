OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOH.I really liked this book, and I wasn't even expecting it! The thing is... the first piece of work I read from Laini Taylor was her short story in "My true love gave to me twelve holiday stories", and I didn't like it, at all. So naturally, after reading that, I wasn't eager to dive into this, BUT OH, I'm glad I did! It was simply amazing! The thing I loved the most about this book is the world Laini created! It is beautiful and intriguing and so original! I love everything about the wishes and the teeth and Brimstone's shop! Fantastic!The one thing I didn't like was the total insta-love, I was enjoying the book so much and then BAM! It happens! The two protagonists met and FELL FOR EACH OTHER IN A BLINK OF AN EYE! I WAS LIKE: PLEASE DON'T. But I forgave them because later in the book we learn something that justifies it, kind of... *thinks about it* No, not kind of, It REALLY explains the insta-love. Also, I really liked Karou's backstory! It completely made sense and it made me love Brimstone even more (FAVORITE CHARACTER!!! Oh, and Mik is pretty adorable).Also, poor Akiva, he's been through a lot :(. I'm not very fond of him, but I really want him to be happy! He deserves it.Am I going to finish the trilogy? YES.
