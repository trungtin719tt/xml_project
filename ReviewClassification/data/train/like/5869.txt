This book was my favourite read of Neil Gaiman's so far! Not that I didn't love the two I had previously read but this was also the first adult book of his that I've read and that definitely made a difference. There was no holding back and I loved the mixture of magic, adventure, intrigue and romance that surrounded this novel. Neil Gaiman is ever the clever and witty writer and this came out in a whole new way for me in this adult novel.Tristran lives in the town of Wall that borders the land of faery and in a quest to prove his 'love' for a young lady he crosses the wall to find a fallen star. And thus the adventure ensues. I have to say, as well, I did love Tristran, he was such an immensely likeable character.I would like to add that technically I would give this book a 4.5 stars rather than a 4 and only not a 5 because I can't help but wish it had been longer. The world of faery beyond the wall was so intriguing and the characters we came across were so fascinating that I wanted more, I wanted an epic fantasy novel but then maybe I'm just being greedy.
