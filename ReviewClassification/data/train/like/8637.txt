Voyager is book 3 in Jamie and Claire series. It is one of my favorites!With the help of Roger and Brea doing historical research, they think they have found Jamie alive in Scotland and working as a printer.And so this book takes Claire through the stones once again and back to Jamie (at long last!). It also gives us insight to some of the events that happened to them during their 20 year seperation;Jamie after the war held up in a cave for 7 years, him being a prisoner at Ardsmuir and then a indentured servant at Hellwater in England.Claire's loveless life with Frank, becoming a Dr and Surgeon, and raising Breanna.But the adventures are just beginning again for Jamie and Claire. Again this book involves murder, history, travel, the witch Gellis Duncan and more.Great story!!!
