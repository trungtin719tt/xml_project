I read American Gods not too long ago, and while I liked it, it didn't turn out to be as amazing as I had hoped. So I wondered if maybe I shouldn't go back and check this one out. You know, see if it was really as good as I remembered?Huh.It was actuallybetter. Hilarious!The 5 star rating stands!Good Omens is going to go down as one of my favorites. I wouldn't say that I laughed out loud, but I snorted once or twice and smiled the whole way through. Who would have thought the apocalypse could be so funny?! Evidently Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Personally, I thought it was a greatcoming of agestory about a boy named Adam Young.Warning: If you are one of those people who wear aWhat Would Jesus Do?bracelet and believes that the purple Teletubby really is gay?This is not the book for you.Just put it down and grab something by C.S. Lewis.The story centers around an angel and a demon who have spent thousands of years on earth together and have quite a good working relationship. Everything is running along smoothly until Crowley (said demon) is charged with delivering the Antichrist to his new family.In other words, handing over the Spawn of Hell to a bunch of (satanic) nuns who will switch him out with a human baby who has just been born. Once the deed is done, Crowley decides to enlist Aziraphale (said angel) to help him stop the coming apocalypse. Because the food and music on Earth isreallygood.They have eleven years before the boy reaches hisfull potential, but unfortunately, due to a mix up with the Satanic switcheroo, the wrong kid gets pegged as the Antichrist and therealAntichrist gets a normal life.It's a Nature vs Nurture + The Power of Friendship + The Odd Couple kind of thing.There's a lot more to it thanthat, but you get the gist.Excellent story. Go give it whirl!
