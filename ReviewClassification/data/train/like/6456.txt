This review contains spoilers.The year is 1880. The Tuck family lives in the small rural town of Treegap, New Hampshire. There is a spring there, located in the Foster's Wood, with water that will give you immortality. If you are 17 when you drink it, 17 you will be forever. The Tuck family knows this because 80 years earlier they drank the water and haven't aged a day since. But now 10 year old Winnie Foster has discovered their secret which creates all kinds of problems for everyone involved, and so the story unfolds. Would you do it if you could? After reading this you will think maybe, but maybe not. It's a thought provoking story with great characters that are easy to love, and the ending has a little bit of a twist.
