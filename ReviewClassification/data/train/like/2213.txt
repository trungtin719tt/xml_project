"My name is Charlie Gordon I werk in Donners bakery..."Daniel Keyes' Flowers for Algernon has beena fascinating, heartbreaking, psychologically stimulating and thought provoking read.Even though this book is categorized under the Science Fiction genre, it is much more and different than all the other books in the same genre."How strange it is that people of honest feelings and sensibility, who would not take advantage of a man born without arms or legs or eyes - how much people think nothing of abusing a man born with low intelligence."This book highlights, very effectively, the way human beings treat their fellow humans, who are mentally disabled and emotionally disturbed. Flowers for Algernon also provides great insights into human behavior and nature.A must read."All I can do now is keep recording my mental state as objectively as possible, remembering that this psychological journal will be the first of its kind, and possibly the last."Flowers for Algernon is about the extraordinary and unprecedented journey of 32 year old Charlie Gordon. Charlie narrates these experiences through his journals."Anyway I bet Im the frist dumb person in the world who found out some thing inportent for sience, I did something but I dont remembir what.""Its easy to have frends if you let pepul laff at you."
