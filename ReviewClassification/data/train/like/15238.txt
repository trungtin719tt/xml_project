After reading a few books recently by first-time authors, I felt like I stumbled into the definition of mastery with this book.It's thick and deeply descriptive, so visceral.... and the language is amazing. Wolfe captures accents so deliciously well that you find yourself speaking the words along with the characters....to blend yourself into the sound environment with them.I've never been so grateful for tightly woven backgrounds and stages so artfully set. I hate being plopped into the lives of characters without having any understanding of the current of the times they live in. Wolfe never left me with this feeling for a moment...in fact...he crafted a history and portrait of events so snug, so thorough, that I sometimes forgot I was reading fiction.A gourmet meal of a book.
