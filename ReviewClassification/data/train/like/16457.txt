This is a wonderful book. A real epic novel of war and romance, it has been called a "Gone with the Wind" set in India and Afghanistan. It is a long adventure that weaves through many of the small "kingdoms" that made up India during the 1800's and the time of Britain's attempted hold on the country and its forays into trying to take over and hold Afghanistan.M.M. Kaye, the writer, knew the landscape and territory she wrote about well because her father was a decorated, "Guide," in the British Army. the Guides were in the 1800's and early 1900's the special forces of the day. It has been written that her lead character of Ashton, completely able to blend in with the colorful, fierce Afghan Pashtun tribes, was modeled after her father.People who know this book - love it and read it again and again. The characters are memorable and one finds oneself wanting to return to re-experience them and the mythical landscapes that M.M. Kaye creates. Stephen King, whom I would not normally think of as liking this sort of romantic, historical genre, has praised it.Even though I have undergraduate degrees in History, Theater and Literature I was not familiar with this book. In 1997, when working with Afghan refugees they shared this book with me, saying that it was a well written, magical story that would teach me about their culture and that of India. Once in I was smitten and could not put it down. I was glad of its War and Peace length, but wish it was longer!Since first reading The Far Pavilions I have met many who knew it and loved it - like a secret club as for some time it was not in publication and could only be found used. Fortunately it is now available new and/or through used book sellers as on Amazon. If you like Historical romances and/or want a real taste of what Afghanistan and India were like in the late 1880's - please treat yourself to this book!!!
