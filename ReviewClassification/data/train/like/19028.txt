Ah . . . more comfort food in the form of a book.After an eventful summer, changes are in store for Anne as she prepares to leave Avonlea for Redmond College.Anne dressed in the cheerless gray dawn, for an early start was necessary to catch the boat train; she struggled against the tears thatwouldwell up in her eyes in spite of herself. She was leaving the home that was so dear to her, and something told her that she was leaving it forever, same as a holiday refuge. Things would never be the same again; coming back for vacations would not be living there. And oh, how dear and beloved everything was -- that little white porch room, sacred to the dreams of girlhood, the old Snow Queen at the window, the brook in the hollow, the Dryad's Bubble, the Haunted Wood, and Lover's Lane -- all the thousand and one dear spots where memories of the old years bided. Could she ever be really happy anywhere else?But, there are new friends to meet and more challenges to conquer. Leaving home may bring heartache, but there is plenty of joy in store for our Anne.This book covers four eventful years in Anne's life, including the hilarious circumstances surrounding the publication of her first short story, the death of an old schoolmate, and the marriage of another. Anne herself receives some mighty strange marriage proposals. This is my favorite:"Yeh're a likely-looking girl and hev a right-smart way o' stepping," said Sam. "I don't want no lazy woman. Think it over. I won't change my mind yit awhile. Wall, I must be gitting. Gotter milk the cows."This makes my husband's proposal of "You're sturdy enough for farm chores" seem almost romantic. (At least he didn't skedaddle off to feel up a bunch of cow's udders.)
