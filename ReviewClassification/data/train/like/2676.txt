Audiobook performed by Frank Muller 6h 56mWell....... I suppose this wasn't my best choice for an Audiobook as I dived into my spring cleaning the May holiday weekend in Canada.Text: 5 starsAudio: 3 starsI have been musing over how exactly I want to approach my first encounter with this well known WWI classic told from the perspective of a young German soldier.What I Liked :1) A perspective on the Great War that focuses on the soldiers and doesn't turn out to be a romance. It's bleak and it's dark and that makes it all the more realistic.2) Originally published in German in 1929, it truly explores the daily stresses of the soldiers and the difficulty of trying to reintegrate in civilian life. It's a " classic" that has aged well.3) There is this beautiful chapter where the main protagonist, Paul, goes home to visit his mother. There is this whole internal struggle going on within Paul of all that he is feeling and wants to say, but decides he cannot because of fear and love.What I Didn't Like1) The audio performance. Call me crazy BUT I would have assumed that the narrator would have a German accent since the perspective is from a German soldier. Often the narrators of audio adopt the accents of their characters. This narrator's pronunciation on some words made the soldiers sound like they were American soldiers at times. I know that I shouldn't focus on this aspect but lacked some authenticity for me as a listener.
