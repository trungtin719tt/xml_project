The mysterious death of an eccentric millionaire brings together an unlikely assortment of 16 heirs who must uncover the circumstances of his death, by participating in and solving a puzzle game, in order to inherit his fortune. These 16 heirs are all brought together under one roof as tenants of Sunset Towers which overlooks the mansion of the deceased millionaire.Sharp, clever, witty and fun, this book is an absolute treat for people who love to read a good puzzle-mystery, complete with twists, multiple disguises/ aliases and illusions to keep one guessing till the end. The plot is not simple but the easy, straightforward way the author writes her story helps the reader keep up with all the twists and turns in the book. It is an ingenious piece of writing which consists of a lot of puzzle solving, bombs going off, some stealing, some serious shin-kicking by the 13 year old Turtle Wexler who is a child prodigy AND the most eccentric will one will ever come across (but one can always expect an eccentric millionaire to come up with an equally eccentric will)!I am so glad I picked this book to read from the library (it was a complete random pick)!
