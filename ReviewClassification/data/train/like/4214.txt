I read this book with everyone else in the family besides my older sister and my dad. I always like the Shel Sliverstine books that we get from the library but they are all a little disturbing.That said I have many favorite poems like What Did? and Messy Room (I can relate.) I like all the poems (even if some of them are disturbing.) There are many ways to read this book ad the main to it is 50 poems at a time. All the poems mean something different to me. All that to say I hope you read this book.
