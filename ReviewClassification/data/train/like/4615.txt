I dimly remembered having seen this comic in a German newspaper when I was little. THAT'S how famousCalvin and Hobbeswas/is!Then I noticed that I unconsciously knew a lot of lines from the comic so I started looking into it and fell in love with the cute artwork and deep messages so I bought the complete edition.This box consists of 4 books: the first has all the comics from 1985-1986; the second those from 1987-1989; the third those from 1990-1992; and the fourth contains all the comics from 1992-1995.Moreover, the first book has a long (but not boring) introduction by Bill Watterson himself in which he explains how Calvin and Hobbes came to be, what his creative drive was and also a little bit about his private life.Now, I don't think I need to say a lot about the comics themselves, so I'll keep this short:Calvin is a very imaginative young boy who has an imaginary friend: Hobbes, a stuffed tiger. And together they have the most awesome adventures.The comics have a very wide range. What's so fascinating is that kids will just see the funny jokes and cute art while adults can also get deeper into the hidden messages. Bill Watterson really is masterful in hiding (for example) political criticism in just a handful of panels! One can see the development of the comic when reading the strips one after the other the way I did, but he was always artful and always had something to say.Some of the themes include friedshipor young love (although ... come to think of it, it still works this way with many adults, too)or well-known problems from the parents' perspectivesor, as mentioned before, deep political views such as thisTo me, this isn't just a comic. It's a very important, very big part of culture and should be known by as many people around the world as possible! And I plan to read these strips again and again and again.Oh, by the way, my favourite quote is this:
