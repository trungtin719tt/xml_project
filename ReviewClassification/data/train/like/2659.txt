Overall, I loved this, and I can't wait to startHarry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkabantoday.Quick thoughts on the things that stood out to me:Wow, the Dursleys were even more loathsome in this book than the first.I love the Weasleys even more than I already did.I am so glad my mother never sent me a Howler.I thought Dobby was annoying in the movie (which I saw when it came out over a decade ago, not having read the book) but I thought he was awesome in the book. In fact, we rewatched the movie last night, and not only was it as unsatisfying as I remember it, it's just a shit adaptation of this book.I thought it was delightful that(view spoiler)[the flying car went into the Forbidden Forest and went feral(hide spoiler)].Tom Riddle's diary was really, really awesome. The entire idea and execution were fantastic.I loved it when Dumbledore told Harry, "It is our choices, Harry, that show what we truly are, far more than our abilities." I hope that, as the series goes on, we have more scenes with him, because I really love his wisdom.My minor complaints seem a little nitpicky, and I suppose that if I'm going to suspend disbelief to accept that wizards are real, I should be able to accept that(view spoiler)[none of the adults at Hogwarts would look in Hermione's fist to see the paper that Harry and Ron found after she was Petrified(hide spoiler)]and(view spoiler)[Fawkes somehow just found his way into the Chamber of Secrets(hide spoiler)], but I'm an adult and if I'd read this as a kid I wouldn't have cared for a single moment.
