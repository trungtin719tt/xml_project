I read this out of curiosity during my freshman year in college. When I approached my English 1A professor about doing a paper on it, she -- and I'm not joking here -- said, "Why would you want to write about a dead white male?" Taken aback, I dutifully bowed my pimpled head and submitted a paper on Ernest Gaines'sA Gathering of Old Men.Not to take anything away from Gaines, who I ended up admiring in his way, but Ms. F? You can suck it.
