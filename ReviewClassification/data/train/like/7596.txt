April 194..,The Plaguesettles in Algeria in the city of Oran, everyday mortal cases multiply. Yet the prefecture is slow to make the declaration of"the state of the plague"because it does not want to worry public opinion. But after a few weeks, in the face of the emergency, the prefect ordered the city gates to be closed.Oran is isolated, separated and cut off from the rest of the world, the inhabitants become"prisoners of The Plague", the city resembles a condemned to death.The epidemic progresses...The Plaguestrikes everywhere and keeps the city folded underneath it. It becomes a "collective affair" and even those who do not carry "that sickness" sickness carries it in their heart.The Plagueopens the eyes of the inhabitants and forces them to think and react. Each individual chooses his camp and adopts an attitude peculiar to himself.Albert Camus illustrates his narrative with key figures such as Rieux the doctor, Cottard the trafficker, Grand the clerk of the town hall, Paneloux the priest, Tarrou the chronicler, Rambert the journalist etc. Each of these protagonists incarnates a different morality facing the Scourge and even if these men disagree on different levels, they turn out to be "men of good will" who act to defeatthe plaguetogether.Camus makes a comparison (without citing it) ofThe Plaguewith war and the rise of Nazism, and the struggle of men against the scourge represents resistance.Men occupy a prominent place in his book, as if the plague only concerned men. Therefore, it can be deduced that conflicts are only a story of men! The woman has a second place, effaced, it appears from time to time as a sweetness, a comfort or even just a support for the man and not a thinking being.In his work, the author depicts a community that shares the same struggle, demonstrating that the effects of the scourge on man can change mindsets, feelings and a worldview. It shows, above all, We are all equal before death.A work of high quality, some passages are of a terrifying realism, the progression and the ravages of the plague are described in the smallest details.The scene of the agony of the child is one of the most painful passages, for we are helplessly witnessing his suffering and inevitably at his death.
