I absolutely LOVED everything about this trilogy! Suzanne Collins possesses all the talent I have been looking unsuccessfully for in a modern author for a VERY long time- which is why I mostly stick to re-reading classics. Thank you, thank you Ms. Collins for restoring my faith in fiction after the fickle and meteoric rise to super-fame of much less talented storytellers over the past decade!This story is so steadily driven toward it's end goal, and the character development is refreshingly, and in some cases tragically realistic. I found myself surprised many times over by how attached I had become to even minor characters as the story progressed.It was entertaining, believable, touching, and significant.Having said all of that- I think it's important to know that this is not an easy story to hear. It's also not really an action-packed adventure, although it does have quite a bit of that. It is a story about adversity, love, courage, and the strength of the human spirit. And it's most definitely not sugar-coated. I would argue that it should not be classified as YA fiction. The only thing "young adult" about this book is that the main characters happen to be in their teens. But as the reader quickly learns, they became adults long before the story even started, and it's all uphill from there.
