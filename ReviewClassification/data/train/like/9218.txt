First thoughts:I might need to change my rating system for this book to be given only 5 stars..Also i need some time to sort out my feelings (between both overwhelming joy and sadness) and come up with a proper review, because i have lots of "wow"s in my mind right now, but i fear that it might not be enough to express how beautiful this book really is.This story really touched a soft spot in my heart."It's all in the view. That's what I mean about forever, too. For any one of us our forever could end in an hour, or a hundred years from now. You never know for sure, so you'd better make every second count."Full Review:This book was so beautiful that I felt the urge to cry so many times, but not just for sadness, but because of all those strong emotions that this story has brought out of my heart.Truth being said, I think I've felt in love that night, while reading it.. not only with Wes but with all the crew members from Wish. I have a big heart in my tiny body, so maybe even Caroline can squeeze in there, also I have a lot of affection for Macy's father, and - if she wasn't so damn stubborn - Macy's mother could've won a little spot too.. just a tiny one.I haven't enjoyed the side characters this much since maybeOn the Jellicoe Road, I haven't cheered as much for the main characters sinceAnna and the French Kiss, I haven't cared this much for someone's (as a character) death sinceWinter LongingorThe Hunger Gamesas a matter of fact.. Oh God, I simply love it!This is a story about loss, and I understand it;This is a story about first love, and remember it;This is a story about beginnings, and I am already there;This is a story about real life, and I am living it...This is one of those beautiful books that I will grab some other time and read it again, and I really hope that I will be able to feel the same emotions, that I am going to love it even more..I liked the way every character in the story handled the loss in their life (and how different their choices were):- Macy's mother and Wes found refugee in their work (the same path but in such a different way)- Macy kept all the pain inside, waiting for it to just disappear in time, but in fact it only got stronger until it became unbearable. I understood her friendship with Wes, how good it felt for her to talk to someone that could understand her and her fears, someone who could take the pain away with only an embrace, or a word, or an understanding smile.- Delia was a mixture between them all. She knew how strong her pain was, and she learned how to live with it (I liked the comparison with the hole in the road, I could understand her better)- Macy's sister was probably more like me. She was the one crying her heart out at the beginning, and after that she was the one trying to put the pieces of her life (and even theirs) back together.Now about the love story, oh, it was precious.Macy and Wes are adorable, too adorable for words.It was such a slow development, in the best possible way, it made me feel like a teenager again, falling in love for the first time.. I loved their truth game and the way they kept finding out things about each other, it was nice to see how perfectly they fit together, how close they became day by day.There are few couples in the YA literature that made me feel so much joy and sadness for them.It's just crazy how beautiful this book really is.And now I'm at a loss for words, so go read the book and then tell the world how much you love it, because I bet you will, with all your heart."...the truth about forever is that it is happening right now..."This review can also be found atReadingAfterMidnight.com____________________________________________Blog (EN)|Facebook|Twitter|Tumblr|Bloglovin'|Blog (RO)____________________________________________
