This is a really fantastic novella! This was the first time I read the book and it definitely offered a really wonderful and interesting perspective that I absolutely loved. It was really well-crafted and absolutely sad (which was expected considering we know how the story must end). Fantastic addition to the series that I honestly think is better than both Twilight and Eclipse.
