More than anything else, Flowers for Algernon is thought provoking. It's also sad when it needs to be, enjoyable for the most part, and often comical. Although it casts a gloomy aspect over the meaning of life, it's somehow still uplifting and motivational.It makes you think about, if you know the end--that you're going to die--is there really a point to carrying on? And even with conditions as extraordinary as Charlie Gordon's, Daniel Keyes, explores that question vividly--through this expertly written narrative.
