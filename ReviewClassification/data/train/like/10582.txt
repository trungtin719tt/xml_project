OH Marilla!Anne's back! She older and wiser and more beautiful than that gangly red-headed girl that first came to Avonlea. This book walks us through Anne as a older teenager, she's back as a schoolteacher at the local school with difficult pupils, she refuses to rule by corporal punishment, but simply to treat her students with kindness. Marilla ends up adopting two twins who are orphaned- Dora &amp; Davy and little Davy just stole my heart in this story. My other favorite was Miss Lavender and her story. Another batch of Anne was just what I needed to break up some of the deeper, darker reading out there right now.I must confess after readingAnne of Green Gables, I was enthralled. I then did watch Anne with an E on Netflix and became HOOKED! Cannot wait to now continue on with the series as all kindred spirits must.
