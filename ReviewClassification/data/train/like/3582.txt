The first time I readTreasure IslandI was 11 or 12 and although it is a challenge for a child whose literary excursions were largely confined to the Famous Five, fromEnid Blyton. I loved every page. There is adventure, violence (hilly), boats, good and bad guys, maps, a treasure and, best of all, pirates! At that age there is something profoundly evocative in words like pirate, ambush, musket and so forth and I have remembered Jim's adventures with great pleasure over the years.In a fit of nostalgia, I decided to read it again, even though I was genuinely worried that I would enjoy it again. However, it is even better, as they have all the elements I remembered from childhood, but now I can appreciate it on a different level and see that it is not all adventure on the high seas, and Treasure Island is a book with live and complex characters. Long John Silver continues the charismatic bandit I remember and although he is a villain who cheats Jim, we can not help liking him.You might say that Treasure Island will not be accessible to toddlers today but this book is immediately accessible to any child with imagination and attention over 2 minutes. In the same way, grown children will also like it because they can revive their childhood a little.
