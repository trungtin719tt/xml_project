I love a book that stands for something. I admire people who have to suffer through such unspeakable acts, but to come out on the other side and take action to help raise awareness is very noble indeed.This book had me cringing in disgust. Is it well written? No. Does it need to be? No.Unbelievable that this sort of thing goes on in our / every society.This book has made me think and feel. I'd highly recommend it, just not for the squemish!!
