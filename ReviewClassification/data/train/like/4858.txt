This one didn't cost me so pain much as I read it or give me so much joy. I suppose that could be because the first book I read of hers wasThe Secret Magdalene A Noveland as a dissastified Christian looking for more, MORE is what I got from that first book. This one was written in Longfellow's fluid prose and had her touch. Some whole sections were so beautiful I thought I was reading prose poetry which I guess I was. I refer to where she sails out into the sea alone to live or to die. Or anytime Hypatia's sister Lais talked or did anything at all. Or the whole last chapter which I shall never forget. I don't know Hypatia so I have no idea if this is accurate or a flight-of-fancy and I admit I don't care. If I want to read a biography, I don't read a novel. This was a novel and the lack of the one star is because although I was there all the way, I wasn't totally gripped. Maybe it's not fair to compare one book to another? Like in music. Some songs an artist writes speaks to you because of your own life. And some songs don't touch you quite as much. Am I giving this book a bad review? Not at all. No. I loved it. But I was never lost in it as I was lost in her story of Mary Magdalene and Jesus. I hear there's a movie being made based on The Secret Magdalene. I'm there.
