1984 by Orwell was the first work of dystopian fiction that I laid my hands on. It left me so numb that I couldn't gather my thoughts on the experience of reading it. Then I read Brave New World by Huxley and then We by Zamyatin followed by the little story (The New Utopia) by Jerome.BNW inspired me to read We. That makes for a reverse order in terms of their time of publication.I am not sure why I felt drawn to these books in succession. May be these readings came in wake of the increasing uncertainty towards the kind of future we are standing on the brink of. I don't know if the nations have become more hostile towards each other than they were ever, whether we the people have become more intolerant towards each other or whether it is because of the faster and consistent accessibility to the happenings around the world that it appears to be the case.May be I felt that these readings might help me understand the extent to which we humans can advance in order to maintain the supremacy of a selected few/ one in power so that some form of uniformity may be imposed in the name of forced ideals. What these readings really did was to lay bare the fragility of societal structure which can crumble and surrender to the whims of its "selected few/one". But it also made clear the neccessity to exercise our faculties rationally, to be aware of the dangers such advances may hold for the future of human civilization itself.P.S : Only thing which really didn't go down well with me about this book was the portrayal of the character of John (the Savage). He is born in a savage society, there is no mention of him being ever educated but he has read the complete works of Shakespeare and his discourse later on shows a kind of deep understanding and adherence to an idea of morality which is difficult to imagine owing to his savage upbringing.
