Shot Downpresents the full horror of living through a war, both of the airmen and the civilians in the occupied countries. Steve Snyder's father did not talk much about his wartime experiences while Steve was growing up; after Howard Snyder's death, Steve researched events in England and in Belgium and France. Most participants in the war are no longer with us, which makes recording their stories so important.Much space is given to the historical context of the war, including the American invasion of East Anglia, the expense of living in Britain, the Schweinfurt missions, Belgium's background in the early war days, V-Mail, the background of resistance groups etc. For someone well-versed in WWII, some of these rabbit trails can be skimmed quickly to get on with the story of the Susan Ruth.he crewmen of Susan Ruth had widely varying experiences after being shot down. Two died in battle before they were shot down, two successfully evaded, three were POWs (two of whom were repatriated because of serious wounds), and three were executed. They provide a chilling picture of what could happen to those who were forced to bail out over German territory.Shot Downshould be required reading for high school and/or college students for an understanding of the price of our freedom.
