I have to wait, like, for ages.... *sobs**UPDATE: READ*Oh, my gosh....it was....how do I even begin to review this book?It was, first of all, awesome. I am so thankful that Roth didn't install a love triangle. I hate those. But all of the hopes I had for Will still being alive were crushed. :(The cover has the tree symbolizing Amity on it, and for pretty good reason. Tris, for reasons which you will have to read yourself, spends a good deal of time in the Amity headquarters (compound? complex?), and you got to know their faction better. The leadership system is quite interesting--they don't really have one. I actually think being Amity wouldn't be too bad.(view spoiler)[Except not the fact that they put drugs or whatever in their bread.(hide spoiler)]It'd be sort of like Abnegation, but a lot less Stiffer. (Get it? STIFFer--oh never mind.) I thought that Candor actually would have been better on the cover, but Amity is okay, too.There was one paragraph where Tris mentions that tears are just some sort of extra function that was not understood by her people. They didn't know why humans cried when they got emotional. But I remember reading somewhere in my seventh grade science book that tears are believed to (or actually do) release stress hormones or toxins from the body. That was one thing which struck me.One of the things that actually did make me cry was the big betrayal in this book. I won't say who it was, but it did hit me like a punch in the gut. Brace yourselves.I did think I liked Divergent a bit better. Insurgent was great, but it didn't have, for me, the addictiveness of Divergent. Perhaps it was just a bit too confusing. There were a lot of new characters to keep track of, and they were constantly moving from place to place. But Roth handled the romance pretty well. My respect for Tris grew when she didn't become the normal YA teenage girl who only thinks about her boyfriend and he takes up an unnecessary fifty pages of the book. She got mad at Tobias, but not for any irrational reasons. Actually, my respect for Tris grew a lot, period. She struggled with coping with Will's death, and with the death of her parents in the previous book, and these struggles seemed totally real to me. I could really sympathize with her. When Christina found out that Tris killed Will, her reaction was believable and understandable, and when she forgave Tris it was one of the moments that touched me the most throughout the entire book.Peter was one character which was developed more in Insurgent. I wasn't surprised when(view spoiler)[he turned out to be a traitor, but he's partly redeemed himself.(hide spoiler)]He's very interesting....I get the feeling he'll play a large role in book three. Maybe he'll sacrifice himself, or something dramatic. Or maybe he'll turn traitor, again. Either way would be awesome.On the whole, I was very happy with Insurgent. The plot did drag a bit in the middle, but the end was great. And the big surprise was really exciting. :D Can't wait for book three!!!!!!*edit*The person who spoiled Allegiant for me: Curse you!!!!! Not literally. Seriously, though. I'm so mad right now.I don't think I'll read Allegiant, sadly.... I don't want to(view spoiler)[dissolve into a shower of tears for weeks and weeks.(hide spoiler)]
