The intro written by Bill Watterson describing how he started, wrote, and ended Calvin &amp; Hobbes was great - well worth the price of buying all the comics I already own (but in one gigantic album set). I've been driving Brandi crazy by reading the comics to her and forcing her to read other ones. I've skipped through the book, but the comics i have stopped to read bring back so many memories. C&amp;H is definitely one of the comics for the ages. And in a way they also remind me of a certain nephew of mine...
