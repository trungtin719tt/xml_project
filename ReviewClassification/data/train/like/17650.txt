This is the 2nd book in the Earth's Children Series, a series I began reading in high school. As I wrote in my review ofThe Clan of the Cave Bear, this book and other early exposure to archaeology thanks to my mom led to my getting a BA in anthropology and working in anthropology museums for several years.Out of the entire series, this is the book I reread most often. I keep it on my bedside table and read bits and pieces of it every few days or weeks. When I do so I always skip over all the Jondalar parts, because he bores me. What interests me -- which I also mentioned in my review ofThe Clan of the Cave Bear-- is how a human adapts and survives in an unknown and alien environment. I always love to read how Ayla discovers the valley, begins to find food, makes herself a home, teaches herself to hunt large animals, makes friends with a horse, begins to train the horse to help her while hunting, and so on.Every once in a while I like to read the end parts where Ayla and Jondalar meet and fall in love too -- because I am just as much of a romantic as most women. :-)
