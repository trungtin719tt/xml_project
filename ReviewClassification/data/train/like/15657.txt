Executive Summary:Another great entry in the Discworld series as different fromEqual Ritesas that book was from the first two.Full ReviewI never expected to marathon the discworld books, but this now makes the third in a row I've read.This book is the first of the Death books. Death plays a much larger role than he has in the previous books, but for the most part it focuses on his apprentice, Mort.I found it started a bit slow, and I was pretty indifferent towards Mort. He grew on me by the end of the book. Four books in though and I feel attached to the world. There are some cameos and references that made me smile.And of course the humor is great. I probably didn't laugh as hard at this one as I didThe Light Fantastic, but probably more than I did withEqual Rites.The pace of the story continues to be good. If you want a light, fun and fast read, you really can't go wrong with a discworld book.And the other thing I'm coming to love is the variety. I easily read three books back to back. If they had all been Rincewind books, I would probably be ready for a break. But as I've had a witches book and now a Death book, I'm ready for another Rincewind book.I've seen a few recommendations that this is a decent starting point for the new reader, and that's probably true. You can come into it without knowing anything about Discworld, and not be lost. I can see why so many fans say the reading order doesn't matter, but I think someone whose read the first four might appreciate this book a bit more.Sadly some other reads have come up to break up discworld reading streak at 3, but I plan to read at least the next two before the month is over. Once again I find myself regretting I didn't get into this series sooner. Don't make the same mistake I did.
