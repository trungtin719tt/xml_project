Cress is Rapunzel . . . Scarlet is Red Riding Hood . . . Cinder is Cinderella . . . Wolf is the not so Big Bad Wolf . . . Thorne is the charming scoundrel pilot (still picture Han Solo) . . . Iko is the quirky droidA cross between fairy tales and Star Wars - really, Star Wars fans might hate me for blasphemy, but I really do keep thinking about it!I like this series - it is very entertaining! I care about the characters and what happens to them. I enjoy the relationships. It might be kinda cheesy from time to time, but I love me some brie! :)Note on Thorne and Cress . . .(view spoiler)[ per Wikipedia from the Rapunzel story regarding the prince who loves her: "he leaps from the tower in despair and is blinded by the thorns below"(hide spoiler)]it all makes so much sense now!
