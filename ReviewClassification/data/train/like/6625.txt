I really enjoyed reading this. Even if I saw the movie before I read the book I was still moved.I fell easily into the story and lived every exchange of words.It was much more complex than the movie and I really liked the way Nicholas described all the action and the characters. Even though I couldn't give the book 5 stars because the ending made me so disappointed :( . But i still recommend this for anyone who is looking for an easy but good book that will make you cry like a baby .
