listen,,,a walk to remember, the 2002 movie, is my favorite film.not just my favorite romance movie,but my favorite movie.it makes me cry. ugly cry.it makes me realize how ugly yet beautiful love is.years later, i finally read the book.preferably, i enjoyed the movie more.the book didn't make me cry,the movie did.i wish it was the opposite...but, it's not the case with this book.i'm still giving this 5 stars.i guess it's cause i've seen the movie, which is always a bad idea to do first.i guess it's because i knew what was gonna happen, even if the dialogue was completely different, even if everything was different, from the plot, characters, and the overall narration.this deserves all my love.the movie deserves all my love,and it has it all.i'll forever cherish it.nicholas sparks, thank you.thank you for making me believe in love even when i doubt it.
