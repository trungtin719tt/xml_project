WOW WOW WOW .I just finished this book and i can't even describe how much i enjoyed it !First of all, The writing was incredible, I loved it !Marissa(the author) managed to grab me into this world that she has created so smoothly , and her writing had a signifacnt part in it .I felt like everything was well-explained and clear in my mind regarding the world and the story settings.In addition, I think that Marissa Meyer had portrayed thecharactersin this book so beautifully. That they felt so real !Second of all, THE PLOT: Man, THE PLOT.I felt like every bit of this book got my full attention, i never found myself wandering in my thoughts or drifting away while reading it. There were always more details and events that caught my attention, and never left me bored .Also , i think it's worth mentioning that this is the first YA-"sci-fi" book that i have ever read, and it definitely won't be the last .The one flawi had in my experience reading this book, was that i predicted the ending from the very start, therefore, i wasn't mind-blown by it, although it didn't make the ending any less dramatic and satisfying .Aside from that, i would often find myself mind-blown by other parts in the book.I, personally went into this book with low expectations ( Since i wasn't really a fan of sci-fi, neither of fairytale retellings ) .But as soon as i finished reading it, it quickly became one of my favorite books of all time !And I can't wait to read the other books in the series .Overall,This book was a fast, fascinating read for me .I would recommend it to anyone, literally anyone !
