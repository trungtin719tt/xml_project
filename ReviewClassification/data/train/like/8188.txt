This book speaks so true to core of what I feel. That core is - being who you REALLY authentically are - and having people in your life who know truly know you. Vivi Walker is a part of me, I think I have a bit of her in me and I identified with her character more than ever. WAnting to be a star, something special and bigger than the small town she grew up in. Always feeling like NO ONE understood her. Life circumstances hit and she remains in that same small town with a group of female friends who have been around since childhood. As I read the story from her daughter, Sida, I see what it is like to be a child of someone who is so big and yet so unfulfilled. What can a Vivi-like person do?I doubt this is the true intentional message of the author, but I got it. Vivi and all her longings and yearnings, and mistakes, and consequences weave a tapestry that is so beautiful to me. This book is one I read at least once a year. I dont' love every single word written, but I love the story and the characters. I love the theme. I love the victory of connection. I always read this book when I need grounding.My most favorite image from the story - Vivi, depressed in her room, has a Mary Kay type salesperson come to the door. Sida tries to summon her mother to the door. The only way she is able to get her to come is by saying, "Momma, there is a woman at the door who is wearing the wrong shade of lipstick" and Vivi snaps to attention.
