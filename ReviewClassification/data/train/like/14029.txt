My review can also be found on my blogCollections.'You are the most beautiful creature I have ever seen walking this earth.'Oh my god...this book! Wow. After enjoyingBloodlinesimmensely, it was pretty much inevitable that I would loveThe Golden Lily. This book exceeded all my expectations, and I'm more obsessed with this series now than I already was before. I just can't get enough of it!InBloodlines, the focus was on learning about the Alchemists and Sydney bonding with her new group of "siblings." We do learn a bit about the Alchemists, magic, and even the so-called vampire hunters inThe Golden Lily, but I felt the story mostly revolved around getting to know Sydney more and her evolving relationships with the characters around her. There was slightly more action than in the previous book. It might not be as much as some want; however, I think there's lots of action to come later. And I can't help but to trust where Richelle Mead is going with this story because so far I'm very happy with how she's developing these characters and their relationships. Likeable characters and great relationships are always what I want in the books I read and this series has that, which is why I want to focus on my two favorite characters: Sydney and Adrian!I adore Sydney and Adrian so much. Those two are some of the most awesome characters I've read about. They are both kind, funny (although, I don't think Sydney realizes how hilarious some of the things she says can be), smart (yes, Adrian is; just give him a chance!), and protective of others. And when they're together, they challenge and bring out the best in each other. Their relationship is perfect! I get a big smile on my face and my heart flutters whenever they interact or are even in the same room. I about died from happiness a couple of times while reading this book because of them. They are definitely the main reason why I love this series.Sydney is still uptight at times, but she's opening up quickly and we're starting to see another side of her. While she hasn't gotten over her Alchemists beliefs just yet, she continues to make decisions based on what she believes is right. And some of her actions won't be viewed favorably by the Alchemistsat all. It worries me, but I'm impressed with her bravery and glad she has a conscience, unlike other Alchemists. As for Adrian, he keeps surprising me. I feel so guilty now for not caring about him inVampire Academy. We get to see more of his vulnerable side in this book, and it really hurt to see him down and upset because of the situation with his father and with what spirit does to his mind. I could also include the whole thing with Rose, but I won't. I really don't think it's about that anymore. He deserves a huge hug and so does Sydney!I'm just loving and having lots of fun with theBloodlinesseries. And if you thought the ending of the first book was crazy, wait until you read the ending ofThe Golden Lily. I had to reread it a couple of times because it was that good. It made me wish I had the next book in my hands right now! (I'm alreadystalkingfollowing Richelle Mead's tweets, hoping for ANY mention of the third book.) Thankfully I have other books to distract me in the meantime, but seriously. I need book three.With amazing characters and relationships and a very intriguing story,Bloodlinesis well on it's way to becoming one of my all time favorite series. I cannot wait to read more!First reading: April 16-17, 2012Second reading: February 16-26, 2013
