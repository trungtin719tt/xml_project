You can find the full review and more about this book on my blog!GEORGE R.R. MARTIN,YOU FREAKING GENIUS!To be honest,I never thought I would read this,not because it is something I don't like(it is something I most like),but it is so huge.But now I thank the gods and the kings for making me read this.I can't explain how much I admire this book.It has been a part of my geeky life and I am proud for that.I am a fan,an ultimate true fan!These are some things you get from reading this book:Smart talks and tacticsTyrion Lannisterthe freaking hot Daenerys TargaryenDragonsBloodOkay so now I'll list things I like from the book:Daenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenDaenerys TargaryenAnd things I didn't like:Theon Greyjoy and the bitch(Joffrey Lannister)everything else was perfect:)Okay so now I'll talk about the perfection of them all Daenerys Targaryen.She is not only my favorite character of all,but after I started watching the show,and she had a face,and boy what a face,I am truly deeply in love(and I got to see her naked).God bless the show.Daenerys is the mother of dragons and you will know what I am talking about in the end of the book,which for me was one of the best endings I have ever read.This world is so complex and there are so many characters,yet it is so thrilling and fun to read.And I love the idea of not having safe characters.In every page you turn,your favorite character can die.Ihighly recommendthis book,this is clearly one of the best works I have read of the last century.And this goes to Mr.MartinPlease kill Joffrey:)*Pictures from the review are not mine, I took them mostly from Google images or Tumblr*
