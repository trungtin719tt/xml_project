This book was a great installment of the Perfect Chemistry series. There are so many similarities to the first book, yet it's somehow different. Very enjoyable, sweet love story.In Perfect Chemistry, Elkeles tried to start the story with the two characters, Brittany and Alex, not getting along. That was okay, but it was just so obvious he was going to fall for the pretty cheerleader, and she would give in to the cute bad boy. With this story even though you pretty much know the two characters would end up together, it was more exciting to read about because they just did not seem to be good together at all.Carlos is very similar to Alex. He hides behind the tough exterior, but deep down he's a good guy. He just needs that perfect someone to bring out the best in him. Kiara is the complete opposite of Brittany from book 1. She loves to work on her car, she is very smart, and not too popular. She's a virgin who hasn't dated much, but she knows what she wants in a man. And Carlos is so not her type. Just like Carlos doesn't think she is his type. As he says, he likes the stupid, easy girls. It's a fun ride to see how the author brings these two together, and the romance is sweet. When reading this I got so many memories of young love and just how exciting everything felt.Along with the romance there is still a backstory about the Fuentes boys and their former gangs. Alex is done with the gangs, but the leader has other plans for Carlos. He is staying at Kiara's house, because her father likes to take in at-risk teens. Her father is really trying to help Carlos turn his life around, but he has to want it.Overall I really liked this book. The only thing I did not like was how similar Alex and Carlos are. It was like they were the same character, and I understand that they are brothers, but still. I would have liked a little more originality. I hope for the final book, Luis is more unique. Other than that these are fast paced, sweet, romantic books with a bit of excitement. Very quick reads.
