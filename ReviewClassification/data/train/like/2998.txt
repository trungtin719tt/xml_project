The book did not disappoint.All for one and one for all! Yes Two is better than one. Yet three is much better than two. There is something happening every chapter.Fast paced and adventurous it is. It's also a little amusing how extremely formal the book is, even the insults are too formal.Overall, The Three Musketeers is a book that one must read even once in his life for it is certainly worth the read.
