Where I got the book: purchased on Amazon.Asher Lev is born into a strictly orthodox Hasidic Jewish community in Brooklyn in the 1950s. His powerful gifts as an artist become apparent when he is a small boy, and he soon learns that his artistic vision is at odds with a worldview which fears and despises art and puts duty to the family and community as the highest calling.This novel is sufficiently deep that I could spend a long time discussing its themes (sacrifice and atonement being two of the major topics) and its characters (none of whom I liked 100 percent). But let's start with the pronouncement that seems to center the book for me:"An artist is responsible to his art. Anything else is propaganda."Yep, it doesn't end well. By the time you've seen Asher grow from an isolated boy to a successful artist, you're pretty sure that Something Terrible is bearing down upon him. And wow, I couldn't have imagined a worse way for him to express his artistic vision if I'd sat down and thought it out with both hands.I can't say I LIKED this book. It wasn't a pretty picture, by any means. As Asher says as a small boy who refuses to make nice drawings of flowers, "it's not a pretty world". But the writing was quite brilliant, deceptively simple with a wonderful musicality when Asher is inside the Hasidic community where Yiddish is frequently the medium of communication, and then blindingly technical when he is with artists.What I took away from this novel is that art is necessarily selfish, and the greater the art, the more selfish it becomes. And that there are other kinds of selfishness in the world beyond art, so should we be surprised at art's self-centeredness?And there was a whole lot more. I'll have to re-read this one a few times.
