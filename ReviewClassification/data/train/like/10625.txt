Well, this is definitely one of those cliffhanger ending books, as many people warned me. So.... close.... yet so far away.Anyhow. The book was excellent, I loved the independent narratives and the writing style. This book made me want to learn so much more about the universe it's based in/on. The allusions to classic poetry and literature were very fitting to the story line, and I think they'll only deepen with what I've read so far ofThe Fall of Hyperion. Yes, I immediately went out and bought the next book in theHyperion Cantos, since I HAD to know what was going to happen to the seven pilgrims next, Well played,Dan Simmons. Well played.
