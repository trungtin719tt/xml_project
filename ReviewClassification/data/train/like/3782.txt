i am actually assuming that i will be Left Behind, so my concern is more for others. i hate seeing families and friends split apart!when it does occur, i would like to be someplace like a church where there will be lots of people Raptured... that way, right afterwards, i'll be able to pick up all the wallets and purses that are also Left Behind. you don't need money in heaven, right? and with all the honest folk gone, i also feel confident that post-Rapture will be ripe for money-making opportunities. no more guilt! i can indulge in all the hustles, scams, and grifts i've ever wanted, to my heart's content - but without feeling any sadness over cheating any of the Good People.yay, bring on those post-Rapture greenbacks! I'M GONNA BE RICH, BITCH!
