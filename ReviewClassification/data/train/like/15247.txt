I'm sick with a cold/flu thing so I'm not sure how good my judgement is right now, but I definitely found my new book boyfriend here. His name is Clay and he's a sociopathic werewolf. He hates humans and kills them without remorse. But, he is also willing to kill anyone for the woman he loves. Isn't that romantic? He's so sweet!aww, you are kinda cute with your little noseless face, aren't you?So, this book is about the only female werewolf in existence, Elena. She's not happy being a furry and left the pack to live a human life. She found a nice mellow man and is trying to pretend that she is a nice mellow woman. But, you can't keep a good furry down!Yeah, the human experience may be a little over-rated...Elena gets called back to the pack to help hunt down some rogue werewolves who are killing people. Being back home reminds her of her wild side, plus there is the matter of a very alluring sociopath, so...go get your freak on, girl!
