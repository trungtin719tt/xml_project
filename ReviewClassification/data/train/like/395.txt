this is my favorite book that i'll never reread.the worst bit of that is that i don't remember this book well enough to do it justice here. but it's beautiful and devastating and human. it's masterful in a way that caught me off guard. there are elements of this story, like the perspective, that will stick with me for life. there are quotes from this book i want tattooed on me.which is why reading I Am the Messenger and it not being great at all was like, whaaaaa? Markus, how you gonna not be magnificent suddenly? do you think it's ok to go from being quotable/brilliant/gently-holding-my-emotions-in-your-hands-like-play-dough-and-then-suddenly-squeezing-and-then-as-if-that-weren't-enough-taking-that-hammery-spiked-mallet-thing-people-use-to-tenderize-meat-and-hitting-them-over-and-over toeh? to weird quasi-profound-ness and gross romance?non, merci.but anyway.bottom line: read this book and try to think zusak only wrote one perfect book, instead of the tragedy of his one-hit-wonder status.(this review is part of a project i'm doing where i review books i read a long time ago, etc etc, does anyone read this, no one cares, and so on)
