Read for Popsugar's 2018 Reading Challenge #13: A Book that is Also a Stage Play or a MusicalThis was super great! It was suspenseful, and the characters were very vivid. The whole thing was bogged down a tiny bit by the book-within-a-book bits (I'm not as big of a fan of Paul's writing as Annie is lol) and it was less gory than I was expecting, but other than that it was fantastic! Definitely one of my favorite Stephen King books that I've read so far (Itis still my favorite at the moment.)
