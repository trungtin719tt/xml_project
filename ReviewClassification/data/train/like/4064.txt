To start off 2016, I decided that chance should pick my first read. So I got my Book Jar off the shelf and asked my little brother to draw for me...and this is what he came up with. I was a bit disappointed because I was sure it would be boring, but it proved a pleasant surprise because I enjoyed myself a lot!If anyone had recommended this to me saying "Anne, you're going to love this heretic 17th century play about a village that goes crazy and starts putting random people in jail. You'll laugh your head off.", I would have been in serious disbelief and would probably never have read it. Thankfully I knew nothing of it, and found that reading about witchcraft and heresy was not so bad after all. I know it's not meant to be adivertingstory and I'm probably pretty crazy to have even laughed at all, but some parts just came off as really amusing and I couldn't help it. I'd go about telling the entire household to draw back their spirits whenever I felt a draught, and blamed that suspicious-looking man I passed on the street for the chill I caught afterwards. Oh, and that mouse I just saw in my dining-room? Definitely the previous house owner who sent it to torment me.If you've read this book, you know what I mean, and if you haven't, give it a shot. It's different, interesting, and full of the intricacies of human nature.
