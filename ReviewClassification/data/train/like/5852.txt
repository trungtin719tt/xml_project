The world-building, the characters, the story - all absolutely amazing!He wondered how it could have taken him so long to realize he cared for her, and he told her so, and she called him an idiot, and he declared that it was the finest thing that ever a man had been called.There's the wonder, there's the intrigue, there's the titch of magic interspersed with ethereal.Neil Gaiman has finally caught me on a story.We have Tristian,a product of his father's wandering gaze and a fairy lass, who in a fit of youthful passion, makes an improbable promise the hottest girl in the village.Victoria (apple of his eye) demands for Tristan crosses the boundary between our world and theirs in search of a fallen star.And thus begins his harrowing journey through the gap in the Wall and into the land of fairyto find an unwitting and unwilling star.This story read like an ancient tale -handed down from generation to generation.The only thing that threw me out of it was the weird sex. Gaiman always(always)strong-arms some sex into the books and while it did further the plot, I think that the events would've played out exactly the same without the naked bits thrown in to titillate the audience.That being said, the rest of the book was magnificent.Very rarely someone comes to Wall knowing what they are looking for, and these people they will sometimes allow through. There is a look in the eyes, and once seen it cannot be mistaken.This is the kind of book that makes you wonder...what if? And hope for the less likely answer.I would highly recommendthe fully illustrated editionof this book (Stardust: Being a Romance within the Realms of Faerie) - there's something about having pictures on nearly every page that brings this book to the next level.Audiobook CommentsI read and listened to this novel. The audiobook narrator (Neil Gaiman, himself) did an excellent job...though if push came to shove, I'd pick the illustrated edition.(For the record, the movie = better).Blog|Instagram
