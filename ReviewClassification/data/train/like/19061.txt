I read this as a school assignment when I was in the sixth grade. I think it was first published in 1948. I have seen, within the last year, about a half hour of the old fifties-era movie of it, starring Clifton Webb as the beloved father. I have not seen the Steve Martin one. (If I'm not wrong, there's a second one with him, too.)I grant that this extremely light memoir of family life in pre-World War One America paints an extremely rosy picture, but it is not unrealistic. There is room in this world for fond reminiscence.Basically, this book is a tribute to the parents of a family of twelve children. The family is clearly upper-middle class, but the quality of life described is not available to those who fit the upper-middle-class bill today. One reason this book is worth reading in our fear-stricken age is that it is a reminder that, at least on the surface, a self-made man in the early 20th century could set up a virtual palace for his family, perform civic duties cheerfully and give his children a sense of well-being.The obvious question for anybody reading this review is, "Is CHEAPER BY THE DOZEN a lie?" Ultimately not. I believe it appeals to a sense of idealism. It is free of the snobbery of most memoirs of the privileged. It is not Jacob Riis. (Look him up, my Goodreads pals!) But it is not a flashy reflection of gaudy times. What I took from this book in sixth grade was that a family could believe in diligence, good works and duty and still be happy. If it's not true that most diligent people who do good and fulfill duties are happy, it probably is true that any happy person is diligent, does good works and fulfills duties.
