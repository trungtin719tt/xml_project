4.0 to 4.5 stars. Another superb story by one of my favorite authors. While not a sequel to his superbAmerican Gods, it shares the title character with that book along with some references to his adventures in that story. While those references add to the richness of the tale, there is no necessity of reading American God first (except for the obvious one that it is one of the best books ever).Anyway, this story center around Charles "Fat Charlie" Nancy, a timid, passive man from London whose life is turned upside down when his very flamboyant father dies. Charlie soon discovers that his father was actually an incarnation of "Anansi" the West African trickster god (whose primary form is that of a spider). Things go from bad to worse when Charlie meets his previously unknown older brother, Spider. Spider proceeds to turn Charlie's previously dull existence upside down through a series of events that I won't spoil here except to say that, in typical Neil Gaiman fashion, they meet a plethora of incredibly unique and intersting characters during the course of the narrative.Neil Gaiman is an incredible story teller and this book is another great one.
