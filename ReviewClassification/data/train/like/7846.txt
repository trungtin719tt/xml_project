Mark Watney is stranded on Mars in the near future. If that makes sense. You all should be familiar with the story by now. Mark's crew thinks he's dead. But though he loses consciousness, he evaulates his chances when he revives.The book is quite funny. It's also quirky. I know that the author didn't send his manuscript of The Martian to publishers and did not have to deal with rejection like 99% of the writers do. He got incredibly lucky, just as his character Mark did.I had to set a lot of my critical brain cells apart, while reading this book. Mark does not have a single moment of retrospection. He keeps on coming up with solutions and keeps on making jokes about his plight. Despite that I had no problem in reading The Martian. I'm glad to have renewed ties with the sci fi genre with such a wonderful book.
