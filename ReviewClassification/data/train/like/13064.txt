I'm going to say it...this was not as good as the first two.I mean I gave it 4 stars so obviously it's not bad but ugh..Cress...ugh. I know she's the majority's favourite but dear God she was annoying. I mean I get she hadn't had human interaction in years but still, I did not enjoy her parts and she took up the majority of the book (well there's a reason it's called Cress and not Cinder or Scarlet but ya know?)She was a bit too childish for my taste and very very irritating.Overall the story was great. It was thrilling and really enjoyable.I really missed Scarlet in this one though. She didn't get enough parts in the book :/ Not only is she my favourite character but she's also one of the most badass loveable character I've ever read.And this series has started giving off some major Six Of Crows vibes.
