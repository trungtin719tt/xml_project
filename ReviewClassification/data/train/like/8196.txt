Read this about five years ago, but it still sticks with me.It shows you how you "really" are like your mother even if you don't want to be. :)I really liked it...I would have been upset to find the scrapbook about my mother's life, but also would want to know.It is an enjoyable read...chick lit of course...but you will love it
