4 starsAfter reading through most of these poems, Emily remains one of my top favorite poets. However, I also came acrossmanypoems that I felt no connection with and frankly made no sense to me. So with that in mind, I unfortunately couldn't give this 5 stars. Still a great experience though!I highly recommend this book if you're a fan of poetry and/or Emily Dickinson.
