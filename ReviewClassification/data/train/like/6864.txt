Okay so I waited for this book forever! I finally got it and read it non stop! It was amazing. I loved everything about it. The story line, plot, the idea of aliens, the characters, the romance and all the hilarious conversations between Daemon and Katy! LOL ;)It was kind of sad about the whole situation with Dawson (Daemon's brother). I can't wait to find out his story. I just wish he comes back with Bethany somehow. My fave part about the book was the first conversation Daemon and Katy have. It was soooooo funny, I had tears in my eyes cause I was laughing so hard! ;pKaty is your average teenage girl. I love the fact the she doesn't get intimidated and has a mind of her own. She believes in what is right and follows her instincts and her heart (Daemon...LOL)! She was incredible in this story, no matter how many times Daemon pushed her away, she only tries harder to be in his and his sister's life! It was inspiring.Then we have Daemon.mmmmmmm! Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is YUMMMM and then he is sooo funny! Although, he puts up a "douchebag" face he actually cares for Katy...even if it's in his own weird way. I love him. Really, that's all I can say. I think I am addicted to his funny comments. It was funny, cause when I was reading I always was anticipating when he would say something hilarious and I would laugh my ass off! LMAO;)It was a really great, amazing, fantastic book! I can't wait to read Onyx next and see where Katy and Daemon's relationship goes. I just wish the waiting time was much less. If I had it my way...I'd get that damn book in this second!!! LOL ;) I recommend this book to everybody! It was crazy but sweet. A great way to pass your time! ;)
