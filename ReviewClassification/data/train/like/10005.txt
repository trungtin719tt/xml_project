Although I did read this book before quite recently, there were a lot of parts I didn't remember about this book that I enjoyed.I loved reading about the trip on the covered wagon, the bridge and story with Jack (that's always been one of my favorite parts of this book).But my favorite part of the story, by far, is when Mr. Edwards comes and gives the girls their presents from "Santa Claus". So cute!!!Overall, lovely book. So glad I re-read it! Five stars out of five.
