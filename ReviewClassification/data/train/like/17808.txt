These stories are florid, overwritten, offensively racist/xenophobic. And they nearly all have the same basic plot.But there's also an odd brilliance to them. They're less terrifying than I expected them to be, but they are fascinating with their revelations of elder beings and unimaginably alien architecture and geometry that's *wrong*. There's a sense of paranoia and of secret truths, and his world-building is very effective. I think my favorite parts were the exploration of the pre-prehistorical ancient cities inAt the Mountains of Madnessand "The Shadow Out of Time".So, there's part of me that wants to dismiss these stories wholesale, or at least to advocate the Cthulu-worshippers as oppressed colonial Others, but I also understand exactly why Lovecraft's stories are so influential.
