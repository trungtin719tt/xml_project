This book kept me company for 46 hours of jogging. It's been a great companion. The audio was wonderfully narrated by Davina Porter.I really enjoyed this continuation of the stories of Jamie &amp; Claire &amp; their family. This series has become a saga for a very large and interesting family. In this book, family is very important and many interesting adventures are had.
