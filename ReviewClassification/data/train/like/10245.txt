This was one of the first satisfying fantasy reads that I found after The Lord of the Rings. I read it when I came home from my first year of college, in 1970. For a long time, I felt like I was the only person who had read this book. Then, slowly, slowly, the recognition for it began to grow. The movie came out, so wondrously tied to the book (and well it should be: the author wrote the screenplay) and I loved it almost as much as the book.All these years later, it is a pleasure to see it gaining the sort of acclaim it has always deserved.Recommended for a read and a re-read, and a read out loud. Yes, it's that good.
