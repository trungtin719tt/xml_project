This book is an absolute masterpiece and it makes it clear in every single sentence. I think it is best to go into it without knowing too much about the plot. You just got to take it as it comes, so to say.Before reading, I was worried that I might have trouble with the writing style. English isn't my first language and the older a book is, the more trouble I seem to have with the writing (because of obsolete words, unusual sentence structures, ect.). However, my worry was totally for nothing in this case. I found the entire book very easy to read (which is even more surprising considering the heavy topics that get dealt with). I also loved how there were many little passages and repetitions of certain phrases. It seemed fitting somehow.I would have never guessed that the blend of a war story with Science Fiction could work so well! It gives it so much room for analysing and interpretation.Honestly, I could write a thousand more reasons why I loved this book, but in the end I would just repeat myself, because I seriously just lovedevery.single.little.thing! I highly recommend everyone to give it a shot.
