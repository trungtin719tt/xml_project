I didn't only read this to fill up my reading challenge. Nope. Not at all.But no seriously: The Grinch is one of my favourite Christmas movies. A secret you probably never knew: I'm the inspiration for the Grinch.Ok, just kidding, BUT: I love the illustrations &amp; though I like the movie a bit more, it was still a cute little read, bringing closer the true meaning of christmas, for me, coming together as a family, being grateful for what we have &amp; giving something back to others, no matter in what form. It isn't about consumerism and materialism at all. For me, it's truly only about my family &amp; the only thing I wish for is for them and my cats to be healthy and happy....
