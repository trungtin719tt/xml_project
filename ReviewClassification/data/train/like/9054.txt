Awesome F-U-N!! I loved this book--I'd rank it right up there with any of the BDB books. Jeaniene Frost writes in a similar witty style as JR Ward does, which I love. I swear I had a smile on my face for 90% of the book. And it was HOT! Not quite erotic, but plentysteamy. I knew that I was in for some steamy reading when the hero Bones was trying to train the heroine Cat not to blush when he 'talked dirty to her'. Whew! There was also tons of action with Cat as a kick-ass, yet vulnerable, loveable heroine, and the hero, British bad-boy Bones...oh, be still my heart! If he isn't the sexiest, most romantic vamp of all time--and what a badd-ass sweetheart too! I won't get into the plot since there are a lot of great reviews of this book, but I will say if you are a fan of JR Ward's BDB or Kresley Cole's IAD series and you're looking for something to fill the gaps until those author's next books come out,do yourself a favorand read this series! You won't be disappointed. I even shed a few tears at the ending...poor Bones.:( And don't worry, even though this one is told in the first person, you won't even notice it. Reading the story from Cat's POV and hearing her thoughts (some of which are really funny) just makes the plot easier to understand and doesn't detractat allfrom the hotness of her relationship with Bones! Now on to the next one,One Foot in the Grave--I can hardly wait! 5 stars.
