Sept. 30, 2009, after my first read: I'm still chewing on this. Not quite sure what to rate it yet. I loved the majority of the book, but I just finished today, and the ending has left me disgruntled. It feels like I have a bad copy that someone snatched the last 100 pages out of.April 4, 2014, after my reread in preparation for the next book's release: I just finished a reread of this (on audiobook, read by the fabulous Davina Porter), and I don't know if it's because my I already knew the terriblehorriblenogoodverybad cliffhangers were coming or if I'm more at peace with the missing pages because I know I'll be reading the next book in a matter of weeks now (because that sounds better than months), but this reread was definitely less painful and much more enjoyable.In fact, I changed my original rating of 4 stars to 5 stars.That's not to say I didn't exclaim, "Fucking book!" when it ended. At least I didn't throw it this time, right?Soon, friends. We'll have answers soon.
