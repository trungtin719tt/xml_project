"A gift," is what Jacob Kahn told Asher Florence, Italy was. I thought this book was a gift too.I really can't say exactly why I liked this book so much but I was completely absorbed in it. First off, I found it interesting to see how a child handles his artistic "gift" when his family and others around him tell him it's foolishness. I found the family dynamic heart-breaking and real. I found the end when Asher had to choose between being true to himself/his art and his religion and what his family would approve of heartbreaking.And although it says on the back of the book that his "extraordinary talent leads him away from his family and his faith," I'm not completely convinced that he was turning his back on his faith. I think he did what he did to be true to his art and to himself with what tools he had. It may have looked like he had to the Jewish community, I think he was stuck in the middle. Just as his mother had been stuck between Asher and his father. The image of the crucifix painting at the end made me weep. I'm not sure why, but it was so extremely powerful. It was sad to see the parents going along and loving their child all the way through his challenge and loving him at the end too, because that's what parents do.I'm glad I read this one.
