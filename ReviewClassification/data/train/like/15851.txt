Irvine Welsh takes readers back to the days before Trainspotting. Exactly how did so many young people end up on heroin? Not just taking, but completely addicted, destroying personal relationships, and with no major fear of AIDS, which is all over Edinburgh, dubbed the AIDS capital of Europe?Welsh makes no easy connections for readers. When Renton's chronically ill (with practically every chronic illness a person can be born with) brother dies, Renton notes his relief, relief at an end to the embarrassment his brother caused him, the love and attention his parents poured over one of their sons, and late-night choking. Even at the end of the novel, you can gently pull some strings of the web together, but Welsh will not make it straightforward, because that's not how life works.I wish I had learned more about some of the characters to get a jist of how they ended up with their unique personalities. Not necessarily why they chose heroin, but why does Sick Boy connect sex with manhood? And where did he get the name Sick Boy? I would assume it was due to his habit, but he has it before he starts using. Same thing with Spud; how does such a tender person end up friends with bullies like Sick Boy and Begbie?Mostly, though, I gave the book four stars because Welsh starts something with the women of Transpotting, a bit of their beginnings, in Skagboys, but doesn't follow through to satisfaction. We meet Lizzie and Allison, but each only get a few chapters compared to the male characters, even minor ones. Allison is memorable as the woman who has a baby and lets it die in Trainspotting. It's such a pivotal moment that she deserves more space in Skagboys.Lastly, I love that at the end of the book Renton acknowledges the pitiful state of his and Sick Boy's lives and says it's not like some famous person is going to come along and make a movie of their lives. Har fucking har, Mr. Welsh. But also funny.
