I don't even know what to say about this book.I read it first when I was 11 years old and I won't say that I understood everything... Also, my dad was pretty shocked when he remembered the sex scenes - AFTER I read the whole thing, so...I have to be in a specific mood (and have enough time) to read this book but it happens about once every two years. I really, really love it; it made me love Fantasy stories even more than I did before so I'll always be grateful for that :)
