This book started slightly slow and I was a little worried I wouldn't like it. But it got better and better. At about 30% or so, I couldn't put it down. I literally read 1/2 the book in one afternoon and into the night. The story is good and the author keeps you uncertain of what is actually happening versus what appears to be happening.If you like thrillers &amp; mysteries I would recommend this book. It's not too long and it's a fun read!
