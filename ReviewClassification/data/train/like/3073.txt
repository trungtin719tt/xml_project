OMG! ABOUT BLOOD PROMISE, MY BEST FRIEND HAD A DREAM THAT ROSE HAD DIMITRIS BABY .I NOE THAT THEY CANT HAVE ANY BUT IT WAZ DIS KIND OF MESSED UP THING THAT HAPPENED, SO THEY HAD A BABY. ROSE WENT TO RUSSIA SO SHE COULD FIND DIMITRI AND SHE FINDS HIM. SHE SHOWS HIM THE BABY THEN SHE LEAVES HIM ALIVE.WHEN SHE MET HIM THERE WAZ SOMETHING DIFFERANT ABOUT HIM AND GUESS WAT? HE KINDA LOOKS LIKE A HUMAN INSTEAD OF A STRIGOI SHE ASKES HIM WHY AND HE HAD A THEORY THAT WHEN HE DOESNT DRINK BLOOD HE THINKS HE TURNS MORE HUMAN SO HES TRYING TO TURN HUMAN &amp; I THINK ITS WORKING!!!!!!!!BUT HE ALWAYS HAS MOOD SWINGS AND LOOKS ALOT WEAKER THAN USUAL 'CAUSE HE DOESNT DARE DRINK BLOOD!SHE THEN GOES TO SEE LISA IN THE ROYAL COURT..AND GUESS WAT?????????? SHES MARRIED TO ADRIAN!!!!!!! CAN U BELIEVE IT? SO ANYWHO..ROSE GOES TO LISSA AND LISSAS HAPPY. CHRISTIAN AND LISA ARNT TOGETHER BUT CHRISTIAN, EVEN THOUGHT HE HATES ROYAL STUFF, HE JOINS EVERYTHING THAT IS ROYAL BECAUSE HE STILL LIKES LISA. LISA STILL LIKES HIM THOUGHT. SHE MARRIED ADRIAN JUST TO MAKE THE QUEEN HAPPY.DIMITRIS POINT OF VIEWHE MEETS ROSE IN RUSSIA THEN SHE LEAVES. WHEN SHE LEAVES HE GOES TO THE ROYAL COURT DAYS LATER. THE THING I CANT BELIEVE IS THAT WHEN HE GOES TO THE ROYAL COURT HE CAN PASS THE WARDS THAT THEY PUT IN THERE!!!!!! HE GOES IN THEN LISA SEES HIM AND HE THEN TELLS HER HIS THEORY THEN SHE TAKES HIM TO ROSE IN LISA'S ROOM. LISA THEN TAKES ROSE'S BABY SO THAT ROSE AND DIMITRI COULD HAVE SOME TIME TOGETHER! WHEN ROSE AND DIMITRI ARE done. THEY GO TO THIS CAFE PLACE. WHEN ROSE AND DIMITRI ARE TALKING GAURDIANS SHOW UP AND ARE SURPRISED THAT DIMITRI IS ALIVE WHEN HE IS SUPPOSED TO BE A STRIGOI. WHEN DIMITRI TELL THEM HIS THEORY THEY SAY EVEN THOUGH HE IS PART HUMAN(!) HE HAS TO GET OUT OF THERE. THEN OTHER GARDIANS SHOW UP AND TAKE HIM SOMEWHERE. THE BAD THING IS THAT MY BEST FRIEND WOKE UP THEN, CRYING . CANT WAIT AND SEE IF ITS LIKE MY FRIENDS DREAM!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!P.S THE BABY IS A BOYYYYYYY!!!(I THINK)
