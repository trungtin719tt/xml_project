I unfortunately picked up this book for the first time as I was leaving for a vacation at my friend's house... for her birthday and Christmas. And I couldn't put it down. I was an appalling house guest, and a worse celebrator. And I don't really regret it, because it marked a moment in time, a turning point for me. I've said this before. I've been sort of struggling with a very personal theory about what I love best in fiction. I think it has something to do with the fact that wonderful fiction (for me) highlights a moment in time when extraordinary things happen to not-necessarily extraordinary people who are forced to react in extraordinary ways. And this book is NOT about that. This book takes that theory and turns it on its head. This book is about an utterly ordinary man to whom extraordinary things give the finger, passing him over for his utterly extraordinary friend. And literally everything that could happen does. And it's about EVERYTHING. I've reread it twice more now, and I'm telling you, each time, I'm on the edge of my seat. And that's great fiction.
