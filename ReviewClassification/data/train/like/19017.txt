This thoroughly engaging non-fiction story of the crew of the B-17 Susan Ruth, shot down over Belgium on February 8th, 1944 is one of the most worthwhile reads anyone interested in WWII history and the air battles will ever find.It's extensively researched, well-laced with photographs and a description of the daily life of the airmen of the Eight Air Force Bomber Groups, without sinking into sentimentalism and shock for the sake of shock.If you want to get an idea of what people lived through under the hobnailed Nazi boot in occupied countries helping the airmen who were trying to set them free, this is one book you shouldn't miss. I just re-read it, and found it just as good as when I first read it.
