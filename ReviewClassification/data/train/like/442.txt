Who can resist the charm of J. R. R. Tolkien's brave little hairy toed Hobbits, awesome Gandalf the Grey, Aragorn, Tom Bombadil, Elf-lord Glorfindel, Half-elven lord Elrond, beautiful Arwen, Boromir, Lady Galadriel, Gimli the Dwarf, and Legolas the Elf.Tolkien describes Hobbits: "I picture a fairly human figure, not a kind of fairy rabbit as some of my British reviewers seem to fancy: fattish in the stomach, shortish in the leg. A round, jovial face; ears only slightly pointed and 'elvish'; hair short and curling (brown). The feet from the ankles down, covered with brown hairy fur. Clothing: green velvet breeches; red or yellow waistcoat; brown or green jacket; gold (or brass) buttons; a dark green hood and cloak (belonging to a dwarf)."Even Hobbit names are whimsical and bring on a smile.Bilbo BagginsFrodo BagginsSamwise "Sam" GamgeeMeriadoc "Merry" BrandybuckPeregrin "Pippin" TookFredegar "Fatty" BolgerRecipe for IRREPRESSIBLE, SPELL-BINDING literary entertainment:Find featured, always hungry Hobbits in hobbit-holes in a Shire and/or at Birthday celebration.
