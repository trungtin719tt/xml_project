i've probably read this 10 times now. i went through a john irving phase, and i ODed about half-way through. (140lb marriage is a terrible book, btw. don't do it).but this is one of my favorite books. it would be desert island number three, but it's a little too sad... i don't think it would be a good idea to isolate myself with it on an island to read again and again for eternity. that said, it's irving at his best. anyone who can take a family involved in incest and abuse and prostitution and suicide and still somehow make you love them and identify with them is a pretty fantastic writer. totally ironic (whatever that really means) and sympathetic. it's sad, and even painful, so i often think about picking it up, but don't. it takes a certain mindset. but everyone should read it at least once.
