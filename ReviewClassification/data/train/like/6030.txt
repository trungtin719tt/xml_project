I love Sherlock Holmes. I love his name, I love his clothes...I just love his style. Reading The Hound of the Baskervilles...I felt like I was reading the first detective novel ever written. Doyle defined the genre--he was the first and the best.My nine-year-olddaughterloves Sherlock Holmes. She has a little Sherlock Holmes hat that we bought for dress as your favorite literary character day, and she loves nothing more than to put on her little brown trench coat from Target, suck on her plastic pipe, and walk around our house interrogating the other members of our family on her quest for the truth--what happened to the little pink pig we haven't seen in ages...who didn't close up the bread when they were done eating it...who took (and did they dare read?) her sister's diary.And the best part is she's never read anything involving Sherlock Holmes--he's just this powerful force of nature and to have ever heard his name uttered is to love him and want to be him.The Hound of the Baskervilles is about a man who is murdered and everyone believes it to have been by a giant Hound from hell--a supernatural dog/beast that has been plaguing the men of his family for years according to local legend. Watson is there, and Holmes as well, to solve the mystery and save the day. This one was adapted for the screen an amazing 24 times. Required reading for everyone, IMO.
