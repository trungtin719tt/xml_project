Psychological thrillers of more recent times, likeDescentandIntensityprobably found their roots with the dark character study in books like THE COLLECTOR. I thought this was just a brilliant novel by John Fowles. Very unsettling, and very chilling, with enough plot twists to keep you guessing. Highly recommended.
