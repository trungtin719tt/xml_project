More fun and playful than I'd anticipated.As a platform upon which to discuss his beliefs and thoughts on theology, government, society and the nature of mankind in general, C.S. Lewis constructedThe Screwtape Letters, an epistolary novel in the form of instructive letters from senior demon Screwtape to his nephew Wormwood, a sort of demonic trainee. For all intents and purposes, they are lectures, but lectures jazzed up and made more palatable for the student's mind.It was about 20 years ago that I'd read aboutThe Screwtape Lettersin college, taking a mental note of its subject matter and filing it away as "to be read sometime in the far off future." Well that future arrived in June '12 and I'd plum forgotten Lewis' literary machinations in regards to this book. So I spent the first few pages somewhat perplexed, trying to figure out who the characters were and then once accomplishing that, reordering my brain to think backwards, because essentially everything written by Screwtape is in reverse of what Lewis means and feels about whatever subject it may be. So as Screwtape advises Wormwood on methods of securing the damnation of a British man, my wee little brain was sprinting to keep up with the conversation as I decoded it, considered Lewis' thoughts, and matched them with or against my own beliefs. Ever since reading hisThe Four LovesI've enjoyed picking at Lewis' theories, so for me this was a fun exercise, especially when immersing it in such a entertaining forum. Since I surely missed a few things, I'll no doubt be going back to this...probably in the 2030s.
