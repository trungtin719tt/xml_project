one of my favorite reads this year. it is a well written and new version/take on the story of jesus and mary magdalene. refreshing, actually. you might say a more "enlightened " version. comes with a recomendation if you a) enjoy novels &amp; b) are open to versions of jesus outside of the bible.it is truly an amazing book.
