This is the book that started me on my lifelong, passionate journey with books.I've been meaning to re-read the "Little House" series for years -- finally now getting around to it, it brings back many happy reading memories of my younger bookish self. I read this for school 29 years ago (!) and it was the first time that I experienced the immersive, reality-suspending power of a great story.Although, all these years later, it's more apparent to me that this was intended for a young audience, at the time I didn't feel that way at all. Wilder wrote "Big Woods" as a (somewhat fictionalized) memoir when she was an older woman, but from the point of view as a little girl. Perhaps because my age was similar to that of the young narrator, it felt very relatable at the time.Today, I still appreciate her stories of pioneer life in the 1870s, and what a life-or-death struggle it must have been for the grownups of the era. The descriptions of sparsely populated, wild wooded Wisconsin, making and storing food, crafting clothing and even music and dancing during the time period are really striking and fascinating to read even as an adult.
