A novel that we read in junior high (in grade nine English, to be exact), Alan Paton'sCry, the Beloved Countrywas likely the first school-assigned literary classics offering that I truly and with all my heart and soul unreservedly enjoyed reading. And whileCry, the Beloved Countrywas not exactly an easy reading experience, it was immensely satisfying, intense, emotionally riveting, and personally very much appreciated, as my parents were absolutely horrified and aghast that our English teacher would dare have us read a novel they themselves considered politically problematic (as both of them were I guess afraid of me somehow turning into a raging Socialist or Communist, as I had always had a very developed sense of justice versus injustice, and was therefore often, but especially upon readingCry, the Beloved Countryvehemently and loudly pontificating that Apartheid was one of the most unjust and evil political and economic systems ever and needed to be changed, pronto). Highly recommended isCry, the Beloved Countryand yes, most definitely also suitable for teenagers, although the issues encountered should, no they must, be discussed and debated (and not to forget Alan Paton's exquisite writing style, as we often seem to focus only on the contents and themes of novels, whilst ignoring or at least skimming over questions of stylistics, parallelisms, irony, in other words, the structures in and through which the contents and themes of novels, of any writing, are presented to and featured for potential readers).
