BRIDESHEAD REVISITEDThere was once a noble house called BridesheadOf sacred and profane memoriesSeat of the last of the MarchmainsAn ancient pile with a false domeWhere painted classical deities cavortedReflected in gilt mirrorsEchoed in carved marblesThe chapel was Art NouveauThe drawing room ChinoiserieAnd the whole thing flanked by colonnades and pavilionsLady Marchmain was a lady of religionPerpetually at her Matins, Lauds and VespersLord Marchmain had long fled the magnificent coopTo live large across the continent with a paramourThe heir Lord Brideshead an ineffectual matchbox collectorThe spare Sebastian doomed to waste in foreign landsSebastian who brushed his teddy bear Aloysius with an ivory combAnd who took his lover Charles homeTo meet his sisters:Pretty and flighty Lady JuliaWith her flawless quattrocento beautyAnd plain jane Lady CordeliaWho went to Spain to minister to the rebelsCharles was a strange cold fishA painter of crumbling manorsWho forsook his wife and childrenTo gallivant across the AmericasTo search for inspirationAmong llamas and lianasBeguiled, ensnaredBy both Sebastian and JuliaBoth loves doomed by divine retributionThe tale told in exquisitely wrought proseWith penetrating intelligenceAnd deftness for conjuring vivid charactersBut what about the scarcely believable denouement?Abrupt and curiously unexaminedAnd must we mourn the passing of the Marchmains soDissolute aristocrats with nothing to do?ET IN ARCADIA EGO
