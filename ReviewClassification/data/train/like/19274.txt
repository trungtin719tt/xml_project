This series was not my favorite at all. I totally loved the first book, but the second and third sequel took me forever to finish. But I think "Rapture" was able to redeem itself. I admit that I was totally lost with some recap scenes, but I think the story was good. Although I never expected the ending to be good.I totally loved Cam. I was really hoping he could atleast have a happy ending for himself, but I was wrong. Coz' until the end, Cam's love for Luce was sad and wasn't returned. I was really thinking that the first love of Luce will be Cam. But I was totally wrong. AGAIN. So you see, this book has lot of twist and turns. I think this sequel is a worth to read after all.
