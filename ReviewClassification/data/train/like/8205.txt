Piece in two acts, the first work I discovered by Samuel Beckett. I'm not disappointed, I like the theater of the absurd.To put two men on stage, to make them speak for two hours to wait for someone who does not come (and who will never come), it was necessary to dare.When we know that these men are vagabonds, that they have nothing important to say to each other, apart from speaking and waiting, that Godot is expected to have no interest, one wonders whether Beckett not take for pigeons.But there are also symbols, Godot, little invisible god, the tree that occupies the stage, the melon hats of those left behind for society ...The play is masterful, it can be represented in every way, comical, tragic, dramatic, one can also see the twentieth century represented in its essence.It is Beckett's most famous play, the one that made it known and a classic of the theater of the absurd. Of great art, in words as in dramatic art.After all this, I hope to see Joyce again.
