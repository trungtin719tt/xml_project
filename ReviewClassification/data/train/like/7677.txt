As far as I could see this was like a maid and a butler in one of those British mansions that lords live in and they didn't shag each other. End of. This for more than 200 pages. It's like I could organise more interesting snail races. Even if the snails fell asleep it would be more eventful than this book. I would say that this book is supposed to be good and they made a film but this is a very good example of why literature is being replaced by computer games. You will not see a computer game called Remains of the Day. You may see one called Remains of the Bitches but not Remains of the Day. Why do these writers think we need to know when a butler blows his nose and if he scratches his ear. I do not get this. But maybe that's what gay British people are like, all butlers and maids and never shag each other. Oh sorry - spoiler alert!! Now you don't have to read it but you can like pretend you did.
